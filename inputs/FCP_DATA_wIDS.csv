The core challenge remains the development of common paradigms for interrogating the myriad functional systems\n                              in the brain without the constraints of a priori hypotheses. Resting-state functional MRI (R-fMRI) constitutes a candidate\n                              approach capable of addressing this challenge. Imaging the brain during rest reveals large-amplitude spontaneous low-frequency\n                              (<0.1 Hz) fluctuations in the fMRI signal that are temporally correlated across functionally related areas. Referred to as\n                              functional connectivity, these correlations yield detailed maps of complex neural systems, collectively constituting an individual's\n                              “functional connectome.” Reproducibility across datasets and individuals suggests the functional connectome has a common architecture,\n                              yet each individual's functional connectome exhibits unique features, with stable, meaningful interindividual differences\n                              in connectivity patterns and strengths. Comprehensive mapping of the functional connectome, and its subsequent exploitation\n                              to discern genetic influences and brain–behavior relationships, will require multicenter collaborative datasets. Here we initiate\n                              this endeavor by gathering R-fMRI data from 1,414 volunteers collected independently at 35 international centers. We demonstrate\n                              a universal architecture of positive and negative functional connections, as well as consistent loci of inter-individual variability.\n                              Age and sex emerged as significant determinants. These results demonstrate that independent R-fMRI datasets can be aggregated\n                              and shared. High-throughput R-fMRI can provide quantitative phenotypes for molecular genetic studies and biomarkers of developmental\n                              and pathological processes in the brain. To initiate discovery science of brain function, the 1000 Functional Connectomes\n                              Project dataset is freely accessible at "", 'Accordingly, the 1000 Functional Connectomes Project was formed to aggregate existing R-fMRI data from collaborating centers\n                           throughout the world and to provide an initial demonstration of the ability to pool functional data across centers. As of\n                           December 11, 2009, the repository includes data from 1,414 healthy adult participants contributed by 35 laboratories (', '. We anticipate that the open availability of the 1000 Functional Connectomes dataset will recruit the broad participation\n                              and collaboration among the scientific community necessary for successful implementation of discovery-based science of human\n                              brain function. In addition, we hope that it will further advance the ethos of data sharing and collaboration initiated by\n                              such efforts as fMRIDC (', "" for supporting the 1000 Functional Connectomes Project data release, Avi Snyder for providing helpful insights and advice\n                              concerning project goals, and Cameron Craddock for helpful advice on this study.

However, several barriers remain. For example, the acquisition of large-scale datasets capable of clarifying the marked heterogeneity that exists in psychiatric illnesses will need to be realized. In addition, there continues to be a need for the development of image processing and analysis methods capable of separating signal from artifact. As a prototypical hyperkinetic disorder, and movement-related artifact being a significant confound in functional imaging studies, ADHD offers a unique challenge. As part of the ADHD-200 Global Competition and this special edition of Frontiers, the ADHD-200 Consortium demonstrates the utility of an aggregate dataset pooled across five institutions in addressing these challenges. The work aimed to (1) examine the impact of emerging techniques for controlling for “micro-movements,” and (2) provide novel insights into the neural correlates of ADHD subtypes. Using support vector machine (SVM)-based multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) we show that functional connectivity patterns in individuals are capable of differentiating the two most prominent ADHD subtypes. The application of graph-theory revealed that the Combined (ADHD-C) and Inattentive (ADHD-I) subtypes demonstrated some overlapping (particularly sensorimotor systems), but unique patterns of atypical connectivity. For ADHD-C, atypical connectivity was prominent in midline default network components, as well as insular cortex; in contrast, the ADHD-I group exhibited atypical patterns within the dlPFC regions and cerebellum. Systematic motion-related artifact was noted, and highlighted the need for stringent motion correction. Findings reported were robust to the specific motion correction strategy employed. These data suggest that resting-state functional connectivity MRI (rs-fcMRI) data can be used to characterize individual patients with ADHD and to identify neural distinctions underlying the clinical heterogeneity of ADHD.', '). These features make rs-fcMRI an attractive measure for translational and clinical applications. As highlighted in the ADHD-200 competition (', 'ADHD-200-Consortium, 2012', 'ADHD-200-Consortium, 2012', 'http://fcon_1000.projects.nitrc.org/indi/adhd200', '), we first provide a comprehensive examination of micro-movements in the ADHD-200 sample, as well as the impact of various correction strategies. Then, we report unique findings from our ADHD-C and ADHD-I samples, after controlling for movement using the most conservative procedure.', 'Section 1: Characterizing and Accounting for Micro-Movements in the ADHD-200 Sample', '), and in the spirit of the ADHD-200 Global Competition (', 'ADHD-200-Consortium, 2012', '), we used the large-scale aggregate ADHD-200 dataset to highlight the need for stringent micro-movement correction. The work also provides the first insights into common and distinct neural substrates of the two most common ADHD subtypes. Application of graph-theoretic metrics implicated atypical connectivity across multiple systems in the combined subtype (ADHD-C), particularly in the default network. Although similar observations were present in the predominantly inattentive subtype (ADHD-I) functional connectivity differences were more evident in bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal regions, and in the cerebellum, rather than in the default mode network. Classification analyses aimed at predicting individual diagnostic status based on patterns of functional connectivity further highlight differential neural substrates for the two subtypes, and serve to provide a vision for future clinical applications of neuroimaging.', 'We anticipate classification rates with the current ADHD-200 sample will continue to improve with optimization of supervised and unsupervised learning approaches. Optimization and extension of feature sets to include other potential markers is also likely to enhance classification. However, it is only through the future creation of a large-scale datasets, with coordinated recruitment, deep phenotyping, multimodal data acquisition (e.g., rs-fcMRI, diffusion imaging, ASL), and likely improved homogeneity in our subgrouping (', ""), which hosts the ADHD-200 Consortium's distribution site ("", 'http://fcon_1000.projects.nitrc.org/indi/adhd200', 'ADHD-200-Consortium.

This initiative brings together researchers from a broad range of disciplines (e.g., basic and systems neuroscience, biostatistics, engineering, computer science, psychiatry, psychology, social work), with interests spanning a range of disorders. The NKI-RS group is focused on developing a unique neuroimaging and genetic sample, linked with descriptive metadata that incorporates solutions for the many challenges facing discovery.

This corresponds to 144,000 scan hours (around 144 TB of raw data and up to 1.5 petabytes of processed data) at a cost of about $43 million USD. However, the proportion of such data currently available in public repositories (e.g., the fMRI Data Center, 1000 Functional Connectomes, Open fMRI, OASIS, ADNI, FBIRN) is less than a few percent.

The effort was to establish a large-scale, aggregate resting state fMRI dataset, along with accompanying anatomical and phenotypic data for children and adolescents with ADHD. The consortium publicly released 776 resting state fMRI and anatomical datasets collected at eight independent imaging sites on March 1, 2011', '), which makes use of the web infrastructure provided by Neuroimaging Informatics Tools and Resources Clearinghouse (NITRC) NITRC.org. Accompanying phenotypic information includes: diagnostic status, dimensional ADHD symptom measures, age, sex, intelligence quotient (IQ), and lifetime medication status. Additionally, preliminary quality control assessments (usable vs. questionable) based upon visual time-series inspection were included for all resting state fMRI scans. The ADHD-200 release data are stored and distributed in two ways: via NITRC Resources (NITRC-R) as tarballs, and via NITRC Image Repository (NITRC-IR', 'For the purposes of the competition, an additional 197 datasets from six imaging sites were released on July 1, 2011 without diagnostic labels (two of the six sites were not represented in the training set, augmenting the challenge). Fifty teams from around the world, representing a diverse array of backgrounds (e.g., mathematics, statistics, computer science, neuroscience) communicated their intent to compete, eventually yielding 21 submissions. This effort demonstrated the latent interest of the larger scientific community to develop effective prediction methodologies for psychiatric neuroimaging. Additionally, it encouraged additional open neuroscience efforts, such as the ADHD-200 Pre-Processed Initiative by the Neuro Bureau', 'In the current issue, several of the teams that participated in the ADHD-200 competition describe their techniques and results. These descriptions will provide the reader with insight into each team’s decision-making process as they developed optimal diagnosis predictions in novel datasets. It is our hope that access to each team’s methodology will spark new ideas and collaborations.', 'In short, the Alberta team’s results drew attention to a major challenge faced by the field in the effort to generate predictive tools using existing data – group differences in base phenotypic variables that reflect population characteristics. ADHD in clinically referred samples is much more frequently recognized in boys than girls. As such, all studies have discrepant M:F ratios for ADHD and TDC groups. In the ADHD-200 sample, this discrepancy was the case (% males in the training set: TDC, 53%; ADHD, 79%; in the test set: TDC, 48%; ADHD, 71%). Similarly, performance IQ in ADHD is lower on average by 7–10 points than that of comparisons. In the ADHD-200 sample, IQ estimates differed between the TDC and ADHD groups (Training Set: 114 for TDC vs. 106 for ADHD, ', 'We note that the primary goal of the ADHD-200 competition was to promote an open science model to foster competitive collaboration among members of the imaging community. The effort also aimed at encouraging the broader scientific community to join us in confronting the challenges of translational psychiatric imaging research. In this regard, this initial effort can already be characterized as a success and the efforts have engendered some momentum for the field. However, the members of the consortium acknowledge that this ', ', uncoordinated dataset was not optimal for moving forward. For this advance to be accomplished, we estimate that a large-scale (e.g., 1000+) multimodal imaging dataset (e.g., resting state fMRI, diffusion tensor imaging, high-resolution structural scans) would need to be created and distributed to the scientific community. Unlike the ADHD-200 dataset that incorporated previously collected data, future reference datasets will require coordination of recruitment and phenotyping strategies. While we recognize the costs, large-scale, coordinated multicenter designs, such as the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative and the Human Connectome Project, are ideal for such endeavors.', 'At a smaller, more feasible scale (and not mutually exclusive), would be efforts to harmonize data collection across independent imaging sites through the use of a core phenotypic protocol and open sharing of ADHD datasets along with core protocol-driven measures. Such a core phenotypic protocol could be as limited as that used by the ADHD-200, or more comprehensive with a brief cognitive battery (which would be preferable). Researchers would have the option not to disclose data beyond the core protocol. To accomplish this harmonized approach, community support for the establishment and coordination of a common phenotypic protocol for ADHD would be required, although even this approach would incur some costs.', 'F.

This was followed by standard registration and normalization to MNI152 space, with the resulting transformation then applied to each individual’s functional data set (12 parameter affine transformation). The resulting time series were then filtered using high- and low-pass filters (cutoff frequencies were 0.05 and 0.1 Hz, respectively). Each individual’s 4D time series data were regressed on 8 predictors: white matter (WM), cerebrospinal fluid, and 6 motion parameters.

To date, the diagnosis of ADHD is mainly subjective and studies of objective diagnostic method are of great importance. Although many efforts have been made recently to investigate the use of structural and functional brain images for the diagnosis purpose, few of them are related to ADHD. In this paper, we introduce an automatic classification framework based on brain imaging features of ADHD patients and present in detail the feature extraction, feature selection, and classifier training methods. The effects of using different features are compared against each other. In addition, we integrate multimodal image features using multi-kernel learning (MKL). The performance of our framework has been validated in the ADHD-200 Global Competition, which is a world-wide classification contest on the ADHD-200 datasets. In this competition, our classification framework using features of resting-state functional connectivity (FC) was ranked the 6th out of 21 participants under the competition scoring policy and performed the best in terms of sensitivity and J-statistic.', 'In order to accelerate the understanding of ADHD and to obtain objective diagnosis methods, the ADHD-200 Consortium publically released the ADHD-200 Samples and held the ADHD-200 Global Competition in 2011. The aim of the contest was to have participants develop and train an image-based diagnosis classifier to predict ADHD-Combined type (ADHD-C), ADHD-Inattention type (ADHD-I) and typically developing control (TDC), based on the 776 samples in the ADHD-200 datasets. Then a test set of 195 unlabeled samples will be used to evaluate the performance of the classifiers developed by the participants. Please refer to the ADHD-200 website (', 'fcon_1000.projects.nitrc.org/indi/adhd200/', 'In our work, we conducted extensive experiments on the features which were extracted from sMRI and rs-fMRI, as well as the combination of both, namely, multi-modal features. We finally selected the FC as the feature to train a support vector machine (SVM) in the contest, because the best cross validation (CV) accuracy was achieved when using this feature. In the final results released by ADHD-200 consortium, we were ranked the 6th out of 21 participants under the competition scoring policy, and our method performed the best in terms of sensitivity and J-statistic. In this paper, we list and compare the performances of all kinds of features to provide a comprehensive understanding of potential useful information related to ADHD diagnosis. The main contribution of this work is that we proposed an automatic classification framework for ADHD and achieved good results in ADHD-200 Global Competition, which constituted a useful exploration for ADHD classification.', 'The datasets for the competition consist of structural and rs-fMRI of 776 labeled subjects for training and 195 unlabeled subjects for testing. The labeled training set contains 285 individuals diagnosed with ADHD and 491 typical developed children (TDC). These samples are collected from eight sites, using different scanners and scanning parameters. Not all the subjects in ADHD-200 datasets are available or suitable for the studies, e.g., images of some subjects are of low quality, making them prone to fail in the preprocessing procedure and produce unconvincing features for classification. Thus, we exclude several subjects before our experiments according to the following schemes: (1) All the images are examined after the scanning and marked with a label of quality control in the phenotypic key. We only retain subjects whose images have a quality control of 1; (2) The subjects of ADHD-Hyperactive type (ADHD-HI) do not contribute to the classifier due to the small number of samples and no requirement to distinguish them from others in the contest. Thus, we exclude all subjects of ADHD-HI type; (3) We exclude subjects whose images fail in preprocessing or feature extraction procedure. In total, 152 subjects out of 776 are excluded and 624 remain. The number of subjects from each site is listed in Table ', ' − 1. J-statistic is used by the ADHD-200 Consortium to compare the competition results of participating groups (', 'fcon_1000.projects.nitrc.org/indi/adhd200/results.html', 'Because of the difficulty of collecting samples, datasets in imaging study are usually quite small in the neuroimaging community. One hundred samples are already quite large dataset and cost thousands of dollars and several months to collect. Thus, opening or exchanging neuroimaging data can produce much larger datasets, making the researches more reliable and convincing. This will benefit the whole community as the ADHD-200 datasets did. However, datasets from different sites usually vary in their scanning device or parameters, and the race of subjects may also be different. These factors might result in different baselines of extracted features. Although some studies argue that multi-site datasets do not significantly affect their results (', '), we find that these studies have some obvious limitations: (1) The number of scanning sites is limited—only two or three, while ADHD-200 Sample have eight scanning sites; (2) All datasets have both patients and normal control, while in ADHD-200 Sample 2 sites have only normal controls. (3) They implement VBM analysis on multi-site datasets rather than classification. Thus, their conclusions may not be applied to our study.', 'In our experiment, we find that the impacts of multi-site datasets on each kind of feature are not similar. For instance, we also use scale-invariant feature transform (SIFT) to extract features for classification and we find that these features can even distinguish subjects from different sites, which means that they can hardly be used directly to predict ADHD patients because of the evidently distinct baseline. We consider that several potential methods may alleviate this problem. (1) The first is to construct a regression model with respect to these factors. Nonetheless, this method might produce more uncertainty, because the impacts of factors such as scanning parameters or races on the human brains are much more complicated than age or gender. A simple regression might not work well. (2) Another method is to regularize the features of subjects from different sites respectively. Although this method may work well on other datasets, it is not suitable for ADHD-200 samples because datasets from some sites have only normal controls or few ADHD patients. We can use this method only when we abandon these datasets. (3) The third method is to train classifier on each datasets from different sites. However, this method, in fact, does not take advantage of the large samples of multi-site datasets. Moreover, the ADHD-200 test set has some samples from a new site, which have to be predicted using the model trained by the samples from other sites. In short, for complicated multi-site datasets such as the ADHD-200 Sample, the optimal solution is still pending and worth further investigation.', 'The ADHD-200 datasets have more TDC than ADHD patients (485 TDC vs. 281 ADHD). Such imbalanced datasets might cause bias of a classifier, making it more prone to classify samples to TDC. In fact, from the competition results released by the ADHD-200 Consortium, we found that for most participating groups, the number of subjects that were predicted as TDC was much more than the actual number of TDC in test set, which was one of the main causes of high specificity and low sensitivity in average (71.77% vs. 31.44%). A prediction system with an excessively imbalanced sensitivity and specificity is defective, which might at least suggest that the classifier is biased while training. We consider that we should pay more attention to other evaluation methods such as F-score or ROC graph rather than using only accuracy of classification.', ' attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder, ADHD-200 competition, resting-state functional connectivity, support vector machine, multi-kernel learning']"

Considering its high prevalence and large economic and societal costs, a quantitative tool that aids in diagnosis by characterizing underlying neurobiology would be extremely valuable. This provided motivation for the ADHD-200 machine learning (ML) competition, a multisite collaborative effort to investigate imaging classifiers for ADHD. Here we present our ML approach, which used structural and functional magnetic resonance imaging data, combined with demographic information, to predict diagnostic status of individuals with ADHD from typically developing (TD) children across eight different research sites. Structural features included quantitative metrics from 113 cortical and non-cortical regions. Functional features included Pearson correlation functional connectivity matrices, nodal and global graph theoretical measures, nodal power spectra, voxelwise global connectivity, and voxelwise regional homogeneity. We performed feature ranking for each site and modality using the multiple support vector machine recursive feature elimination (SVM-RFE) algorithm, and feature subset selection by optimizing the expected generalization performance of a radial basis function kernel SVM (RBF-SVM) trained across a range of the top features. Site-specific RBF-SVMs using these optimal feature sets from each imaging modality were used to predict the class labels of an independent hold-out test set. A voting approach was used to combine these multiple predictions and assign final class labels. With this methodology we were able to predict diagnosis of ADHD with 55% accuracy (versus a 39% chance level in this sample), 33% sensitivity, and 80% specificity. This approach also allowed us to evaluate predictive structural and functional features giving insight into abnormal brain circuitry in ADHD.', 'Toward this aim, the ADHD-200 global competition challenged the neuroscientific and data mining communities to develop pattern classification methods to predict ADHD diagnosis based on a combination of demographic information, structural MRI, and resting-state functional connectivity MRI (rs-fcMRI) measurements. The data for this competition were collected as part of the Functional Connectomes Project (FCP) and the International Neuroimaging Data sharing Initiative [INDI; (', '). The ADHD-200 initiative included the public release of neuroimaging and demographic information for nearly one thousand children and adolescents, some of whom had ADHD diagnoses, and some of whom were typically developing (TD) (Table ', '). Since classifiers can perform better with larger training samples, pooling data across multiple sites is an important direction for the field and one that is being taken by the ADHD-200 global competition.', 'In the present paper, we (1) briefly review some of the key structural and functional neuroimaging findings that are thought to differentiate ADHD from TD individuals, (2) present the ML approach that we applied to the ADHD-200 competition, (3) explore which feature modalities and brain regions proved to be the most useful for classification, and (4) reflect on important areas of broader insight and future directions that can be drawn from the ADHD-200 initiative, due to its unique position as the largest neuroimaging ML effort to date.', 'As part of the ADHD-200 competition, a training dataset was released first; it included structural and functional imaging data from 776 individuals (491 TD and 285 ADHD), their diagnostic class labels (TD or ADHD subtype), and accompanying demographic information (Table ', '). Therefore, when considering the vast ADHD-200 dataset, a crucial component was determining how to limit which features to include in the final classification vector. While the task of feature selection is difficult for any dataset, it becomes even more complex when classification is performed on multimodal data, where the features themselves are represented in different spaces and may vary in number over many orders of magnitude.', '), which is even more directly relatable to the ADHD-200 challenge. SVM-RFE, as its name would suggest, works backwards from the initial full set of features and eliminates the least “useful” feature on each recursive pass. In contrast to optimization methods that can revisit locations in feature space [e.g., genetic/evolutionary algorithms (', 'To address the multisite aspect of the ADHD-200 dataset, we employed a collection of site-specific classifiers, rather than a single classifier with site as a feature. This allowed us to tailor feature selection to each site, while also accommodating the unique site-specific aspects of the data set (See Sections “Demographics” and “Classification across sites”). Site-specific classification was also chosen based on initial findings of heterogeneity of top features and above chance prediction accuracies between different sites. For example, because of differences in study inclusion criteria or varying T1-weighted scan qualities and acquisition parameters, the morphological features might be very useful at one site, but not at another. Additionally, this approach is able to handle missing features (e.g., IQ is not reported from the NI site), since the classifier for that site can simply be trained without them. For the Pitt site, although there were no ADHD subjects in the training data, the available TD subjects were used to align TD feature means across sites, and thus allowed us to tap into the discriminating aspects of the data from the other sites (Figure ', '). For each test subject in the ADHD-200 competition, the most common class in the set of predictions determined the final class label.', '). The ADHD-H subtype was the lowest represented among the three subtypes, and prior information from the ADHD-200 contest indicated that no subjects with this diagnosis would be included in the test set. We therefore excluded these subjects, and constrained our diagnostic predictions to three classes. Of the remaining subjects, the highest prevalence of ADHD was 55% at the NYU site, and the lowest was 27% at the KKI site. For the two main ADHD subtypes, ratios varied widely between sites—from 18:1 ADHD-C:ADHD-I at the NI site to nearly 3:5 at the Peking site.', 'ADHD-200 Competition Results', 'The performance of our ML approach was judged on an independent hold-out test set of 197 individuals as part of the ADHD-200 Global Competition. Classifier performance metrics were reported to us by the competition organizers (', 'http://fcon_1000.projects.nitrc.org/indi/adhd200/results.html', 'After the ADHD-200 competition was finished, the true class labels for the test set were released to the community. This allowed us to perform ', 'In the current work, we presented our method for classifying the ADHD-200 dataset based on structural and functional neuroimaging data, feature selection with SVM-RFE, individual site- and modality-specific classifiers, and voting to assign final class labels. This approach outperformed all measures of chance-level performance, and was competitive among the other entries in the ADHD-200 Global Competition. Looking forward, this vast neuroimaging dataset provides an excellent resource for studying ADHD. Machine learning and classification tools may provide new means for exploring these data, and may help to determine which underlying neural features are related and perhaps give rise to ADHD.', 'The large variation in ADHD prevalence and subtype ratios between sites is also important to explore. While these specific numbers are of course artifacts of sampling bias across the individually-designed studies that joined ADHD-200, they again highlight the importance of tuning our classifier to the variable prevalence within sub-groups in our population. Similar diversity also exists in the real world, as, perhaps, some regions of the country have a higher prevalence of a certain disease due to differing demographic, genetic, or environmental factors. In the ADHD-200 sample, these observations helped build an intuitive understanding of how our classifier should perform. We already knew that designing a classifier to resolve a behaviorally diagnosed disease like ADHD from TD, based on brain imaging data alone, would be challenging. On top of that, it seemed unlikely that imaging features would outperform the very strong baseline expectations about which subtype to expect at which site. Therefore, we decided early on that we would concentrate our effort on classifying ADHD from TD, generally, and would default to these prior expectations for assigning subtypes to the ADHD subjects.', 'Although the ADHD-200 multisite dataset has been utilized already in the neuroscience community to further our models of ADHD and motivation (', ""), protocol variations between sites led to large inter-site differences in measurement. This highlights the need for consistency in procedures to make data sharing efforts most effective, which will allow for an enhanced ability to replicate results (or compare differences) between different analyses. For example, the IQ scores across the ADHD-200 sample were derived from different raters and different test instruments, depending on site, and the NI site didn't provide any IQ data at all. This posed the challenge of how to best utilize this useful feature at most sites, but not all, and also while accommodating potential site effects. Even more extreme, the Pitt site only included TD subjects in its training data, and the Brown site did not provide "", 'The most surprising result to come out of the ADHD-200 competition was that, although imaging features were moderately useful for classifying ADHD from TD subjects, including these features failed to provide any additional benefit over using demographic features alone. There were 195 possible points (two of the 197 original test subjects were excluded), which would have required correctly predicting all ADHD subjects as well as all ADHD subtypes. The winning ', ' score of 124 points was reached by ignoring the imaging features completely and relying solely on the demographics information. Interestingly, this is close to the 127 points we predicted early on based on our own analysis of a subset of the demographics features in the training set (Section “Expected classifier performance”). Nevertheless, we had decided to continue investigating the imaging features for two reasons: (1) those were the main focus of the ADHD-200 project, and (2) we reasoned the imaging features would be more generalizable, as we suspected some of the demographics effects were simply artifacts of study design. Still, this finding is a good reminder that when we see claims like “Feature X is useful for classifying disease Y,” we should ask the question, “Relative to what baseline?” In this case, the imaging features ', '). Ultimately, the ADHD-200 initiative is leading the way toward a productive new era of neuroscience collaboration, but it still remains to be seen if and when our growing understanding of the neural basis of ADHD will eventually begin to lead to improved clinical outcomes over the current standard of care.', ' attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, ADHD-200, machine learning, classification, feature selection, fMRI, graph theory']"

Most studies used Pearson correlation coefficients among the BOLD signals from different brain regions to quantify functional connectivity. Since the Pearson correlation analysis only provides a limited description of functional connectivity, we investigated functional connectivity between the dACC and the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) in three groups (adult patients with ADHD, n\u200a=\u200a21; TD age-matched subjects, n\u200a=\u200a21; young TD subjects, n\u200a=\u200a21) using a more comprehensive analytical approach – unsupervised machine learning using a one-class support vector machine (OC-SVM) that quantifies an abnormality index for each individual. The median abnormality index for patients with ADHD was greater than for TD age-matched subjects (p\u200a=\u200a0.014); the ADHD and young TD indices did not differ significantly (p\u200a=\u200a0.480); the median abnormality index of young TD was greater than that of TD age-matched subjects (p\u200a=\u200a0.016). Low frequencies below 0.05 Hz and around 0.20 Hz were the most relevant for discriminating between ADHD patients and TD age-matched controls and between the older and younger TD subjects. In addition, we validated our approach using the fMRI data of children publicly released by the ADHD-200 Competition, obtaining similar results. Our findings suggest that the abnormal coherence patterns observed in patients with ADHD in this study resemble the patterns observed in young typically developing subjects, which reinforces the hypothesis that ADHD is associated with brain maturation deficits.', 'The data used in this study are publically available via the 1000 Functional Connectomes Project database (', '2.9 Application of the Method to the ADHD-200 Sample', 'Although the main focus of the current study is the investigation of connectivity patterns and abnormality index in adults, we also performed the proposed analysis using the data of publicly released at the ADHD-200 Sample (', 'http://fcon_1000.projects.nitrc.org/indi/adhd200/', 'Since the aim of this replication is a validation of the proposed approach, we calculated the abnormality index based on coherence and OC-SVM using exactly the same parameters described in subsection 2.4, 2.6 and 2.7. Similar to the adults analysis, the data was split in three subsamples: ADHD patients older than 15 years old (36 children; mean age\u200a=\u200a17.25 years, s.d.\u200a=\u200a1.58), age-matched typical developing children (87 children; mean age\u200a=\u200a17.65 years, s.d.\u200a=\u200a1.61), and young typical developing children (131 children; age between 12 and 15 years old; mean age\u200a=\u200a13.47 years, s.d.\u200a=\u200a0.87). The abnormality index of the subjects were calculated independently for each pairwise combination between the three groups, by following the approach described in subsection 2.7. All research carried out by ADHD-200 contributing sites was conducted under local IRB approval. The data was fully anonymized in compliance with HIPAA Privacy Rules.', ' shows the results from the application of the proposed approach to the ADHD-200 sample. Note that the results is analogous to the ones obtained in the adult sample: ADHD patients present abnormal connectivity pattern when compared to age-matched TD (p\u200a=\u200a0.009), age-matched TD and young TD patterns are different (p\u200a=\u200a0.001), and ADHD and young TD have a more similar patern (p\u200a=\u200a0.368). Furthermore, low frequencies around 0.05 Hz are the most relevant for discriminating between ADHD patients from TD age-matched controls.', ' ADHD-200 Sample: Boxplots of the abnormality indexes of pairwise comparisons between groups at different ages.', '. In addition, similar findings are found when applying the proposed approach to the ADHD-200 children sample.

We participated in the 2011 ADHD-200 Global Competition which involved analyzing a large dataset of 973 participants including Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) patients and healthy controls. Each participant's data included a resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scan as well as personal characteristic and diagnostic data. The goal was to learn a machine learning classifier that used a participant's resting state fMRI scan to diagnose (classify) that individual into one of three categories: healthy control, ADHD combined (ADHD-C) type, or ADHD inattentive (ADHD-I) type. We used participants' personal characteristic data (site of data collection, age, gender, handedness, performance IQ, verbal IQ, and full scale IQ), without any fMRI data, as input to a logistic classifier to generate diagnostic predictions. Surprisingly, this approach achieved the highest diagnostic accuracy (62.52%) as well as the highest score (124 of 195) of any of the 21 teams participating in the competition. These results demonstrate the importance of accounting for differences in age, gender, and other personal characteristics in imaging diagnostics research. We discuss further implications of these results for fMRI-based diagnosis as well as fMRI-based clinical research. We also document our tests with a variety of imaging-based diagnostic methods, none of which performed as well as the logistic classifier using only personal characteristic data."", '. The ADHD-200 dataset described in the next paragraph presented an important opportunity to test diagnosis based on resting state fMRI data with much larger participant numbers.', ""In summer 2011, the ADHD-200 Global Competition challenged teams to provide the best procedure for diagnosing individuals with ADHD from their resting state fMRI scans. Specifically, the goal was to assign each individual to one of three categories: ADHD-C, ADHD-I, or healthy control. (The ADHD-200 dataset contained only 11 individuals diagnosed with ADHD-H, and the ADHD-H category was therefore not considered in the diagnosis task.) The ADHD-200 Consortium made available a large Training Dataset that contained data from 776 participants collected at multiple institutions. Each participant's data included a resting state fMRI scan, a structural MRI scan, and individual characteristics data (age, gender, handedness, and IQ scores). The test (holdout) dataset was comprised of data from 197 additional participants for whom diagnostic information was not provided. Competition entrants had to build and train a diagnostic procedure using the 776 training participants and then submit predicted diagnostic labels for the 197 test set participants. Teams were ranked based on the accuracies of their predicted diagnostic labels. The ADHD-200 dataset is the first publicly-available dataset with fMRI scans from on-the-order-of one thousand participants, including both psychiatric patients and healthy controls. In contrast, previous studies on fMRI-based diagnosis ("", ') included 20–104 participants (median 39 across all 12 studies). The ADHD-200 dataset represents considerable effort and time on the part of its contributors and the ADHD-200 Global Competition organizers. As such, the competition provided an important and thus far unique opportunity to test fMRI-based diagnosis with a very large group of psychiatric patients and controls.', 'Data analyzed in this paper came from the ADHD-200 dataset, comprising data from 973 participants (for more details, see ', 'ADHD-200-Webpage, 2011', '). Each of the 973 participants was scanned at one of eight different sites, which pooled their data to make the ADHD-200 dataset. The eight sites were Peking University (PekingU), Bradley Hospital/Brown University (BrownU), Kennedy Krieger Institute (KKI), NeuroIMAGE Sample (NeuroIMAGE), New York University Child Study Center (NYU), Oregon Health and Science University (OHSU), University of Pittsburgh (UPitt), and Washington University in St. Louis (WashU); see ', 'ADHD-200-Webpage (2011)', "". For every participant, at least one resting state fMRI scan was provided as well as a T1-weighted structural scan and several personal characteristic data points (age, gender, handedness, and for most participants one or more IQ scores). For the 2011 ADHD-200 Global Competition, the data were divided into two datasets. The ADHD-200 Training Dataset included 776 participants, and the holdout set (Test Release dataset) included 197 participants. For the competition, participants' diagnostic labels—healthy control, ADHD-C type, or ADHD-I type—as well as medication status and scores on various ADHD assessment instruments were given for the training set but not the holdout set. Competition entrants used the training set to train their diagnostic algorithms. They then applied those algorithms to the holdout set to generate predicted diagnoses for the 197 holdout participants, and they submitted these predicted diagnoses to the Competition organizers."", 'For all experiments on diagnosis using fMRI data as input, we used the subset of the ADHD-200 Global Competition Training Dataset derived by excluding the 108 participants whose resting state fMRI scans were given “questionable” quality assurance (QA) scores by the data curators. For the work described here, we refer to this dataset as the “Training Dataset.” (We refer to the original 776 participant ADHD-200 Training Dataset as the “Original Training Dataset.” Note that this is a superset of the Training Dataset). Our Training Dataset included 668 participants, whose details are shown in Table ', ' below. Note that data from Brown University were included in the ADHD-200 Competition hold out set but not in the ADHD-200 Competition training set.', 'Subsequent to the competition, diagnostic and medication data were released for the 197 ADHD-200 Holdout Dataset (“Test Release”) participants, except for the 26 participants from the BrownU site. In some analyses performed after the competition, we used the subset of the ADHD-200 Holdout Dataset consisting of the 171 participants for whom diagnostic data were released. We refer to this subset as the “Holdout Dataset.” (We refer to the original 197 participant holdout set as the “Original Holdout Dataset.”) For details of Holdout Dataset participants, see Table ', 'ADHD-200-Webpage (2011)', 'The ADHD-200 Global Competition required three-way diagnostic classification, but we also explored binary diagnosis because we suspected that it might be easier than three-way diagnosis. In binary diagnosis, we classified participants as healthy control vs. ADHD, collapsing across ADHD subtype. In three-way diagnosis, we classified participants as healthy control vs. ADHD-C vs. ADHD-I.', ' = 9). We also compared accuracy results to the baseline chance accuracy achieved by guessing healthy control (i.e., the majority class) for every participant. Note that this definition of chance accuracy is different from the one used by the ADHD-200 Global Competition organizers (see ', 'ADHD-200-Results-Webpage, 2011', 'For the ADHD-200 Global Competition, we tested various Diagnostic Pipelines on the three-way diagnosis task using 10-fold cross validation. We selected the best-performing Diagnostic Pipeline, which turned out to use the logistic classifier with only personal characteristic data as input. Since fMRI data quality did not affect personal characteristic data, we trained the logistic classifier on all 776 participants from the Original Training Dataset. We applied this trained classifier to the 197 ADHD-200 Global Competition Original Holdout Dataset participants to generate predicted diagnostic labels.', ' in tests prior to the ADHD-200 Global Competition deadline. Our competition submissions were also generated using ', ""For the resting state fMRI data, we used our own preprocessing pipeline based on the SPM8 fMRI analysis package as well as in-house MATLAB code, as opposed to the preprocessed data supplied by the ADHD-200 Global Competition organizers. Preprocessing for each participant included: (1) 6 parameter rigid body motion correction in SPM8, (2) rigid body co-registration of functional scans to subject-specific anatomical scans in SPM8, (3) non-linear spatial warping (estimation and interpolation) of each subject's anatomical volume to the MNI T1 template space at 1 × 1 × 1 mm resolution in SPM8, (4) interpolation of fMRI volumes into the T1 template space at 3 × 3 × 3 mm spatial resolution using warping parameters from step (3), (5) 8 mm full width at half maximum (FWHM) Gaussian spatial filtering of fMRI volumes in SPM8. At this point, all participants' resting state fMRI data were aligned in the MNI T1 template space, and they had the same spatial dimensions (57 × 67 × 50 voxels) and the same spatial resolution (3 × 3 × 3 mm voxel size). The fMRI data still varied in temporal duration and sampling rate depending on the participant and site of data collection. Preprocessing step (6) involved truncation of all resting state fMRI data to length 185 s and temporal linear interpolation of all fMRI scans into a sampling rate of 2 Hz or 0.5 s volume time (see Appendix B for details and motivation of temporal preprocessing). After step (6), participant fMRI data had the same temporal dimensions (370 time points with a 0.5 s volume time). For the FC Analysis (end of section 2.5), we did not use preprocessing step (6) on the data. All other fMRI analyses included step (6). Also see Figure "", 'At the time of the ADHD-200 Global Competition deadline, the logistic classifier using personal characteristic data selection 1 (', ' input features trained on the entire ADHD-200 Original Training Dataset to generate our predicted diagnostic submissions for the competition based on the ADHD-200 Original Holdout Dataset. Our submission achieved the highest prediction accuracy (62.52%) as well as the best competition score (124 out of 195) of any of the 21 competing teams. The competition scoring system assigned one point for every correct diagnosis and 0.5 point for a diagnosis of ADHD but with the wrong subtype (e.g., diagnosing ADHD-I when the participant was actually in the ADHD-C category). For more details of competition results, see ', 'ADHD-200-Results-Webpage (2011)', ' on the 171 participant Holdout Dataset, for which diagnostic labels were released after the ADHD-200 Global Competition. The results of these holdout tests are shown in Table ', 'Twenty-one teams took part in the ADHD-200 Global Competition. Our personal characteristic-based diagnostic approach outperformed all imaging-based approaches from the other 20 competing teams (see ', 'ADHD-200-Results-Webpage, 2011', 'The best accuracies achieved by the ADHD-200 competition teams were 62.52% using personal characteristic data and 60.51% using fMRI data. For comparison, one would obtain a chance accuracy of 55.0% by guessing “healthy control” for all participants in the ADHD-200 Holdout Dataset (Original Holdout Dataset). Previous studies have reported successes with fMRI-based diagnosis of ADHD (', '). These twelve studies reported diagnostic accuracies ranging from 68% to 89% with a median of 86%. Superficially, these observations may suggest that it is fairly challenging to diagnose ADHD with high accuracy in the ADHD-200 sample. The ADHD-200 dataset presented unique and novel challenges for fMRI-based diagnosis. As we discuss below, this dataset is probably much closer to the data that would be generated in real-world clinical settings, in comparison to the more constrained datasets used in previous studies. We argue that achieving three-way diagnostic accuracies better than chance with this dataset is an encouraging early success in this context.', 'Firstly, the ADHD-200 competition requirement for three-way diagnosis is intrinsically more challenging than the binary diagnosis considered in most previous studies. The standard accuracy score is computed as the number of participants correctly classified/total number of participants. This score favors binary diagnosis, which differentiates patients vs. controls, over diagnosis with three or more diagnostic classes. In three-way diagnosis, participants correctly classified as patients but with the wrong diagnosis count as complete misses when computing accuracy scores. For example, this happens when an ADHD patient is classified as having ADHD but with the wrong ADHD subtype. Accordingly, our best binary diagnostic accuracy of 75.0% on the Training Dataset (see Table ', 'Secondly, the ADHD-200 competition forced competitors to use a Holdout Dataset that could not be used for training classifiers nor for selecting a classifier algorithm, feature extraction procedure, or preprocessing procedure. This is in contrast to some previous studies which tested multiple classifiers without correcting for multiple comparisons (over-fitting). For example, suppose one were to test a dozen different classifiers using ', '-fold cross validation to protect against over-fitting within each test. By emphasizing the results from the best-performing algorithm or reporting only those results from the best algorithm, one still exposes oneself to the multiple comparison problem by virtue of testing multiple classification algorithms. The best performing algorithm may be best for the particular dataset being used for testing, simply by chance. That algorithm may not generalize to new data drawn from the same distribution. The ADHD-200 competition results were based on a holdout dataset. Using a holdout set avoided the multiple comparison problem and predisposed the ADHD-200 results to compare unfavorably to studies that did not correct for multiple comparisons. We see this effect in our tests of personal characteristics-based diagnosis. The Diagnostic Pipelines that performed best on our Training Dataset achieved lesser accuracy when tested on our Holdout Dataset (see section 3.1 and Tables ', 'Thirdly, the ADHD-200 dataset presented new challenges in terms of participant heterogeneity with which previous studies did not have to contend. The ADHD-200 sample contains 973 participants. This is many more participants than were included in the previous studies cited above. Those twelve studies included from 14 to 104 participants with a median of 39 participants. In a study with 20 participants, it is possible to select them to be fairly homogeneous in terms of age, gender, socio-economic background, medication history, and clinical sequelae. In contrast, the ADHD-200 sample pooled hundreds of participants from eight different sites in various countries. We expect that the ADHD-200 data were more heterogeneous compared to datasets used in previous fMRI diagnosis studies. Combining data from multiple sites introduced additional potential heterogeneity in terms of participant nationality, genetic background, and cultural background, as well as potential differences in how clinical groups in different institutions applied ADHD diagnostic criteria. MRI scanner hardware and settings certainly differed across the eight sites contributing to the ADHD-200 dataset, in contrast to previous studies that collected all data on a single scanner. Previous studies of fMRI-based diagnosis did not have to contend with heterogeneity on this scale. The ADHD-200 sample is the first fMRI dataset to combine such large numbers of psychiatric patients and control participants. That the ADHD-200 Global Competition teams did not achieve high accuracy diagnosis with this data may simply reflect the need for new methodological approaches to address this heterogeneity. More research into new fMRI-based diagnostic methods that are robust against participant heterogeneity is clearly warranted and may enable high accuracy diagnosis with the ADHD-200 dataset in the future. Because data from clinical settings also vary across sites, scanners, patients populations, and so on, robustness against these sources of data heterogeneity will be important as we work toward deploying fMRI-based diagnosis in clinical settings.', 'To reduce inter-site variability, we tested diagnosis using resting state fMRI data from ADHD-200 participants all taken from a specific site. Within-site diagnosis was not more successful on average than using the entire Training Dataset (results not shown). Our robust cluster-based feature extraction methods were an attempt to improve diagnostic performance generalization to novel test data by reducing feature heterogeneity, but these attempts were unsuccessful. Most of the individual ADHD-200 sites included relatively large numbers of participants, for example 216 from NYU. The data from a single site likely still exhibited substantial heterogeneity among participants, and the diagnostic algorithms we tested may not have been robust against this heterogeneity.', 'The ADHD-200 Global Competition teams did not achieve high accuracy diagnosis using the resting state fMRI scans in the ADHD-200 sample. It is possible that resting state fMRI may not be an ideal imaging protocol for diagnosing ADHD specifically. Before adopting this strong conclusion, one would obviously need to exclude the possibility that the ADHD-200 competition teams may have used non-optimal diagnostic approaches, as discussed above. One other group has reported 85% accuracy on binary diagnosis of ADHD patients vs. controls using resting state fMRI data (', '). These studies both utilized the same group of 9 ADHD patients and 11 controls. It is likely that these small participant groups were more homogeneous than the ADHD-200 participant groups. It is unknown whether ', ""'s diagnostic methods to test them on the ADHD-200 sample. It is possible that fMRI data with a different psychological task, such as an attention task or response inhibition task, may be more effective for fMRI-based diagnosis of ADHD. To our knowledge, no one has attempted diagnosis of ADHD with these fMRI protocols."", 'The ADHD-200 Global Competition presented the first opportunity to test fMRI-based diagnosis of a psychiatric illness with a large dataset comprised of hundreds of participants from multiple data collection sites. Encouragingly, the ADHD-200 competition teams achieved three-way diagnostic accuracies above chance on this challenging dataset. The relative success of using personal characteristics such as age, gender, IQ, and site of data collection to perform diagnosis indicates that such personal characteristic data should be considered carefully in fMRI-based diagnostic work as well as in studies employing group comparisons. It is important to include control tests of diagnosis based only on personal characteristic data. Combining personal characteristic data and fMRI data has the potential to improve diagnostic accuracy (see Sidhu et al., 2012, under review). Between-groups statistical comparisons did not produce features (biomarkers) capable of diagnosing individual participants with high accuracy. Because the ADHD-200 dataset combined large numbers of participants from different data collection sites, it imposed novel challenges in terms of inter-participant heterogeneity. Future studies of fMRI-based diagnosis must develop methods that are robust against such heterogeneity. One potential approach may be to adapt existing machine learning methods, which were developed in other contexts, to the identification of individual differences in fMRI datasets. Such individual differences may have better diagnostic utility than differences derived from group comparisons. Novel methods that are robust against heterogeneity will be particularly important as we work toward delivering new fMRI-based clinical diagnostic tools that could be deployed in diverse, real-world health care settings.', 'This work was supported by the Alberta Innovates Centre for Machine Learning, Alberta Innovates—Health Solutions, the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC), and the University of Alberta VP (Research) Office.

We chose to up-sample, rather than re-sampling into an intermediate sampling period such as 2.0 s, to minimize temporal re-sampling errors. If we had re-sampled all scans into a 2.0 s volume time, those scans originally sampled at 1.5, 2.5, and 3.0 s would have been affected by interpolation errors (see Figure ', ' Brown MRG, Sidhu GS, Greiner R, Asgarian N, Bastani M, Silverstone PH, Greenshaw AJ and Dursun SM (2012) ADHD-200 Global Competition: diagnosing ADHD using personal characteristic data can outperform resting state fMRI measurements.

In extension to the seminal paper by ', '). The 1000 Functional Connectomes Project (', 'The entirety of the dataset of the 1000 Functional Connectomes Project (', "" nature of the 1000 Functional Connectomes dataset's formation by merging independent, non-coordinated individual studies, between-study heterogeneity is an important issue to clarify before analyzing this dataset. The original analysis by "", ""Of note, it can be seen that while on the one hand there are some components that can be found in almost all component sets of single studies analyzed separately (C.01, C.03, C.07–C.09), other components appear only in the single-study results of about half of the studies included in the 1000 Functional Connectomes dataset (C.02, C.12–C.16). Still, even the most consistent group components do not exhibit uniformly high spatial correlation with their matching components or fail to bidirectionally match with a component from each set of single-study components. Component C.08, for instance, has a partner-matched component in every single study, yet spatial correlations with its matched components are as low as 0.12 for the dataset Ann Arbor b, 0.39 for Milwaukee a and 0.46 for München. Conversely, there is a generally low consistency of some studies with all group results (the maximum correlations of a component of the three example studies mentioned above with a group component are 0.65, 0.7, and 0.62, respectively). On the other extreme, there are some group components which could not be unambiguously matched to only one component in a given study despite there being a component with high spatial correlation. This is an indication that there might be a second equally well matching component in this study's dataset, probably due to a division of the network into subcomponents."", ' who, using a different method for the group ICA, identified a cerebellar network on data from the 1000 Functional Connectomes database. On a related note, in the short duration of a typical fMRI resting-state scan, it is possible that not all networks show a distinguishable activity pattern in all subjects to be discerned by ICA methods, which might also account for some between-subject variability in the networks identified. This fact is also a useful reminder that there are limits in the interpretability of individual ICA components (', ', group ICA as the most complex of the computational tasks involved was performed separately on multiple subsets of 306 subjects due to computational limitations preventing simultaneous analysis of the whole sample. The extensive work of the R community in the handling of large datasets and parallel computing, including computation on graphics processing units (GPUs), provides the tools for analyses previously prohibitive from a computational point of view and accelerates the emergence of data driven discovery science in the field of neuroimaging. For instance, the exploratory approach used in this work allows for the unbiased drawing of an overall picture of the substantial amount of data acquired in 33 studies performed by 26 centers worldwide, while still keeping the total processing time under a week. The most important addition to the current knowledge made possible by the computational techniques employed, however, is the assessment of heterogeneity of resulting components with respect to the entire sample, both at the level of single subjects and of individual studies. As a result, an overview on networks more commonly found in individual studies as well as an assessment of divergence between the sets of networks intrinsically emerging from the data of different centers has been presented, possibly providing some guidance for the interpretation of variability in resting-state networks obtained in past and future studies. This paper shows the richness of evidence present in the 1000 Functional Connectomes dataset, but ultimately only scratches the surface of what can be examined and opens a host of new questions to be answered in future analyses.', 'We want to thank all investigators contributing data to the 1000 Functional Connectomes project, without whom this analysis could not have been performed.

Each participant's data consisted of a resting state fMRI scan as well as phenotypic data (age, gender, handedness, IQ, and site of scanning) from the ADHD-200 dataset. We used machine learning techniques to produce support vector machine (SVM) classifiers that attempted to differentiate between (1) all ADHD patients vs. healthy controls and (2) ADHD combined (ADHD-c) type vs. ADHD inattentive (ADHD-i) type vs. controls. In different tests, we used only the phenotypic data, only the imaging data, or else both the phenotypic and imaging data. For feature extraction on fMRI data, we tested the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), different variants of Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and combinations of FFT and PCA. PCA variants included PCA over time (PCA-"", ' with resting-state fMRI data as well as phenotypic data for automated diagnosis of ADHD. These results are encouraging given known challenges of learning ADHD diagnostic classifiers using the ADHD-200 dataset (see ', 'We tested these seven feature extraction and classifier learning processes on the ADHD-200 Global Competition dataset (Fair et al.). Automated diagnosis of ADHD using this dataset has proven to be very challenging for the scientific community in general. Twenty-one teams took part in the ADHD-200 Global Competition. Our team submitted a classifier that used only the phenotypic data to produce a diagnosis. This classifier achieved the best accuracy (62.5%) of any submission (', ""; Alberta Innovates Center for Machine Learning). For comparison, guessing “healthy control” for every participant in the ADHD-200 Competition's holdout dataset produced an accuracy of 55%. See "", ' methodologies, as well as our testing methodology. Section 3 discusses the results for each of these methods on the dataset provided by the ADHD-200 Competition. Briefly, the best diagnostic accuracy was achieved using a combination of phenotypic data and fMRI data with feature extraction based on FFT followed by kPCA-', ""Automated ADHD diagnosis protocols were tested on data from the ADHD-200 Global Competition dataset (Fair et al.). We used 668 of the 776 participants from the ADHD-200 Competition's training dataset, after removing the 108 participants whose scans did not pass quality assurance checks by the ADHD-200 data curators. This 668-subject dataset, summarized in Table "", "" left, contained the age, gender, handedness, IQ scores, and scanning site, as well as a resting-state fMRI scan for each of 429 healthy controls, 141 ADHD-combined (ADHD-c) patients, and 98 ADHD-inattentive (ADHD-i) patients. Most participants were adolescents, while the remainder were children or young adults. We tested each learned classifier against the ADHD-200 Competition's holdout set (Table "", 'The ADHD-200 Global Competition organizers provided both raw and preprocessed data. Instead of using the preprocessed data that they provided, we used our own pipeline to preprocess the raw fMRI images using SPM8 (The FIL Methods Group) and in-house MATLAB code (as specified below).

To further test the results—i.e., to make sure they were not a consequence of overfitting—we used a holdout set to evaluate the performance of each method.

The organizers released this data after the competition concluded. We used 171 of the 197 subjects in the holdout set, where we excluded 26 subjects from a hospital that did not authorize the release of their diagnoses. For both the two and three class settings, the baseline accuracy on this dataset was 54.97%, derived by guessing “healthy control” for all subjects.', ""Resting state fMRI scan durations and sampling rates were different for different data collection sites. In preprocessing the data, subject's fMRI scans were truncated to the shortest scan length in the dataset (185 s) and resampled to a 2 Hz sampling rate (see section 2.2). To investigate whether the truncation and re-sampling procedure may have had detrimental consequences on diagnostic accuracy, we tested diagnosis using the ADHD-200 Competition's preprocessed data. Given that images from different sites differed in their temporal dimensions, we only tested performance from one site, the NeuroIMAGE site (Fair et al.). When we compared kPCA-"", ""'s features or only the phenotypic data. This finding is particularly important given how challenging automated diagnosis with the ADHD-200 dataset has proven to be. Among the ADHD-200 Global Competition submissions, no imaging-based diagnostic method out-performed a fairly simple approach using the logistic classifier with phenotypic data inputs (see "", 'The ADHD-200 data were collected from multiple hospitals across the world. One consequence with this large data release is that the MRI scanner hardware and scanning protocols differed among hospitals (Fair et al.). The resulting variability in the data may have obscured diagnostically-useful patterns in the imaging data.', 'The resting state fMRI scans from the ADHD-200 dataset were collected with different volume times, where the number of subjects are parenthesized: 1.5 s (88), 1.96 s (48), 2.0 s (410), 2.5 s (221), and 3.0 s (1).

We did not have such historic information about the adult subjects involved. In conclusion, our results can only be interpreted as the effects of the self-reported autistic trait on the functional brain connectome and diffusion anisotropy patterns, observed in normally functioning adults. We raised the specificity of our study by employing a conservative FDR adjustment method, although many of our measurements are highly dependent from each other; for instance, hemispheric equivalent regions are highly synchronized (r>0.9). Therefore the decision threshold in terms of accepted p-values could be higher and impairments in a larger set of regions would be linked to the autistic traits. Furthermore, by building and analyzing larger and clinically controlled datasets such as the ABIDE (\u200a=\u200aAutism Brain Imaging Data Exchange), it will become possible to explicate the neural correlates of this puzzling mental condition while more plausible biomarkers could be developed for the diagnostics and prognostics of ASD."", 'Nooner KB, Colcombe SJ, Tobe RH, Mennes M, Benedict MM, et al.

This promise has largely been unrealized, at least partly due to the heterogeneity of clinical populations and the small sample size of many studies. A large, multi-center dataset provided by the ADHD-200 Consortium affords new opportunities to test methods for individual diagnosis based on MRI-observable structural brain attributes and functional interactions observable from resting-state fMRI. In this study, we systematically calculated a large set of standard and new quantitative markers from individual subject datasets. These features (>12,000 per subject) consisted of local anatomical attributes such as cortical thickness and structure volumes, and both local and global resting-state network measures. Three methods were used to compute graphs representing interdependencies between activations in different brain areas, and a full set of network features was derived from each. Of these, features derived from the inverse of the time series covariance matrix, under an L1-norm regularization penalty, proved most powerful. Anatomical and network feature sets were used individually, and combined with non-imaging phenotypic features from each subject. Machine learning algorithms were used to rank attributes, and performance was assessed under cross-validation and on a separate test set of 168 subjects for a variety of feature set combinations. While non-imaging features gave highest performance in cross-validation, the addition of imaging features in sufficient numbers led to improved generalization to new data. Stratification by gender also proved to be a fruitful strategy to improve classifier performance. We describe the overall approach used, compare the predictive power of different classes of features, and describe the most impactful features in relation to the current literature.', 'In this paper we describe our efforts to use attributes derived from MR images as well as non-imaging phenotypic measures to predict the presence or absence of an ADHD diagnosis in child and adolescent subjects. This opportunity was made possible by the availability of a large dataset comprising structural and resting-state functional MRI scans and associated non-imaging phenotypic data (e.g., gender, age, and cognitive testing measures) from 776 children and young adults. These data were provided by the ADHD-200 Consortium, a “self-organized, grassroots initiative, dedicated to accelerating the scientific community’s understanding of the neural basis of ADHD through the implementation of discovery-based science” as part of the ', 'ADHD-200 Global Competition', '). The ADHD-200 sample represents a starting point for this approach in ADHD research and presents a test bed for utilizing large sets of anatomical, network, and non-imaging measures for objective diagnosis of complex neurobehavioral disorders that currently require extensive, continued behavioral testing for diagnosis, and lack clear biomarkers.', 'ADHD-200 Dataset', 'Anatomical and resting-state functional MRI scans were performed at 8 different facilities on children and young adults ages 7–21 years (mean: ∼12 years), approximately half (∼53%) male. Participants were diagnosed as either typically developing or ADHD-Hyperactive, ADHD-Inattentive, or ADHD-combined type. These data and various metadata describing subject phenotypic traits (including diagnosis) were made available to download through the ADHD-200 Consortium. Too few cases of ADHD-Hyperactive type were available for any practical analysis and, in general, the other two subtypes are not distinguished in our analysis below except to assess subtype-specific performance. In other words, we describe classifiers built to determine the presence or absence of ADHD irrespective of subtype, but we were able to analyze ', 'The ADHD-200 dataset has provided a new opportunity to apply exploratory data analysis, data mining, and machine learning tools to the incredibly challenging problem of neuropsychiatric disorder diagnosis. While there is great value in meta-analyses across sets of previously conducted studies, computational scientists place great value in the ability to apply the same methods directly to commonly coded datasets made publicly available in a common format. To achieve results that would directly impact ADHD diagnosis, it may be important to collect data from even more subjects.', 'http://fcon_1000.projects.nitrc.org/indi/adhd200/', 'http://fcon_1000.projects.nitrc.org/indi/adhd200/']"

The neural substrates associated with this condition, both from structural and functional perspectives, are not yet well established. Recent studies have highlighted the relevance of neuroimaging not only to provide a more solid understanding about the disorder but also for possible clinical support. The ADHD-200 Consortium organized the ADHD-200 global competition making publicly available, hundreds of structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and functional MRI (fMRI) datasets of both ADHD patients and typically developing (TD) controls for research use. In the current study, we evaluate the predictive power of a set of three different feature extraction methods and 10 different pattern recognition methods. The features tested were regional homogeneity (ReHo), amplitude of low frequency fluctuations (ALFF), and independent components analysis maps (resting state networks; RSN). Our findings suggest that the combination ALFF+ReHo maps contain relevant information to discriminate ADHD patients from TD controls, but with limited accuracy. All classifiers provided almost the same performance in this case. In addition, the combination ALFF+ReHo+RSN was relevant in combined vs. inattentive ADHD classification, achieving a score accuracy of 67%. In this latter case, the performances of the classifiers were not equivalent and L2-regularized logistic regression (both in primal and dual space) provided the most accurate predictions. The analysis of brain regions containing most discriminative information suggested that in both classifications (ADHD vs. TD controls and combined vs. inattentive), the relevant information is not confined only to a small set of regions but it is spatially distributed across the whole brain.', 'In 2011, the ADHD-200 Consortium, a self-organized, grassroots initiative, dedicated to accelerating the scientific community’s understanding of the neural basis of ADHD through the implementation of discovery-based science, launched the “ADHD-200 Global Competition”', ' in which researchers around the world were invited to develop diagnostic classification tools for ADHD diagnosis based on structural MRI and fMRI of the brain. The ADHD-200 Consortium made available datasets aggregated across eight independent imaging sites that contain resting state fMRI and structural MRI datasets for individuals diagnosed with ADHD and TD individuals.', 'The data used in the current study was acquired by the ADHD-200 Consortium which provided public release of 929 resting state scans of children and adolescents with ADHD and typical controls. The data was acquired in eight different sites: Peking University, Bradley Hospital/Brown University, Kennedy Krieger Institute, NeuroIMAGE Sample, New York University Child Study Center, Oregon Health & Science University, University of Pittsburgh, and Washington University. This data was released in the ADHD-200 Competition, coordinated by Prof. Damien Fair and Prof. Michael Milham, and organized by the Consortium. The competition released both the structural MRI and fMRI scans of 759 subjects with the respective labels (TD control, inattentive, and combined ADHD) in order to motivate participants to train and develop algorithms to predict the group of a single subject, given his/her neuroimaging data. The data of additional 170 subjects was then released without the group labels and the competition participants were asked to send the predicted labels. The true label of this test set of subjects was then released after the announcement of the competition results. All research conducted by ADHD-200 contributing sites was conducted with local Internal Review Board approval, and contributed in compliance with local Internal Review Board protocols. All data distributed via the International Neuroimaging Data sharing Initiative is fully anonymized in compliance with the HIPAA Privacy Rules. Prior to release, it is ensured that the 18 patients’ identifiers were removed, as well as face information. The complete demographic data is presented in Table ', '. Further details about both the samples and scanning parameters can be obtained under request to the ADHD-200 consortium.', 'Demographic information of the subjects from the ADHD-200 sample', '. In this study, we considered the images from all labeled subjects provided by the ADHD-200 Competition because the quality metrics were satisfactory and also to allow comparisons of the performances with other studies based on the same dataset.', 'The ReHo maps from each subjects of ADHD-200 sample were provided by the Neurobureau and are available at the referred website', 'The fALFF maps of ADHD-200 sample are available at the Neurobureau website.', ', in which the RSN were estimated using a modified dual regression approach. The RSN maps of each subject are available at the ADHD-200 website of Neurobureau. The analysis of the 10 first group ICA maps shows unequivocally that the fourth component is related to the default mode (positive values) and task-positive networks (negative values), which are frequently described as anti-correlated systems (', '), the accuracy of each classifier was estimated. The evaluation of the extracted features and classifiers was carried out by using a total of 929 fMRI scans, i.e., 759 subjects released as the labeled data to train the classifiers, and the unlabelled scans of 170 subjects (group labels released after the competition) used to test the classifiers. In order to evaluate the stability and variability of the classifiers, the evaluation was carried out using Monte Carlo subsampling. At each iteration (from a total of 100), the data of 100 subjects from the 759 labeled subjects were randomly sampled without replacement. This subsample was then used as the training data for each of the 10 classifiers and to predict the label of the 170 subjects of the test data. This approach provided a set of measures of sensitivity and specificity at each iteration, which were then used to calculate descriptive statistics for each classifier. We chose Monte Carlo subsampling instead of leave-one-out cross-validation because the sample is relatively large, and thus, it may provide information about the stability (variability) of each classifier. Although the ADHD-200 sample is unbalanced, we prefer to train the classifiers using random sampling instead of constraining the groups to have the same size, because we believe this would be a more realistic scenario. The average sensitivity and specificity was calculated as an additional measure and we refer to them as the “total score.” The expected value of the total score in the case of classification by chance is 0.5. Regarding the combined vs. inattentive ADHD classification, the same pipeline and evaluation approach were used to classify the two subtypes. In this case, the sensitivity refers to the former group and specificity to the latter. In addition, the scores from the released test set (170 subjects) when training the classifiers using the whole training sample (759 subjects) were also computed.', 'In the current study, we investigated the predictive accuracy of different machine learning and feature extraction algorithms for the classification of TD controls vs. ADHD patients and combined vs. inattentive ADHD. Our main concern was to compare the performance of the classifiers and also to evaluate the discriminant information contained in fALFF, ReHo, and RSN maps. We provided a systematic comparison of these methods using the ADHD-200 Consortium dataset released by the ADHD-200 competition (in September 2011).', 'The first point to be discussed is that the scientific community had a fundamental role in the implementation of the current study. The ADHD-200 consortium provided a large multicenter neuroimaging database and excluding some few exceptions, current studies exploring the predictive power of the state-of-the-art classifiers and neuroimaging in clinical applications report findings from relatively small samples (tens of subjects). In addition, the community has benefited considerably from the work of the Neurobureau and several collaborators, which preprocessed the enormous amount of raw data. These contributions were crucial since they allowed the participation of researchers from outside of the neuroimaging community and were extremely helpful to the researchers from the community, facilitating the features extraction implementation. The Neurobureau and the collaborators who provided the scripts for image processing motivated an innovative and multi/interdisciplinary research during the ADHD-200 competition. As described previously, the RSN, ReHo, fALFF maps, and CC400 atlas, which had a pivotal role in this study, were obtained via Neurobureau. In addition, the classification routines were also obtained from the scientific community via libraries LiblineaR and RWeka from the R-project platform for Computational Statistics.', 'One of the limitations of this study and ADHD-200 sample has already been pointed out by the results of Alberta Team during the ADHD-200 competition: the demographic data (age, gender, IQ, etc) of the samples are not fully matched and thus, may contain discriminative information for group’s prediction. On the other hand, we argue that it would be unrealistic (and not meaningful from a clinical perspective) to have a complete homogeneous, controlled, and perfect matched samples, since it is already know that some demographic and behavioral data are indeed associated with ADHD. Actually, we also believe this is not a crucial point, so long as classification methods are not used as the main diagnostic reference but are used to provide complementary evidence and support. A second limitation to be mentioned is that we did not consider any brain region masking based on previous information from the literature. We chose to apply a more exploratory (whole brain) approach to investigate discriminant information in the data. However, the accuracy of the classifier could be higher if only the features from “', '. The results suggest an heterogeneity between train and test sets released by the competition. Details about the selection of train and test subjects were not provided by the competition but it was previously informed that the data from other sites would be part of the test set. Although the investigation of cohort effects and heterogeneity between train and test sets is relevant, in the current study, we limited the exploration to the context of ADHD-200 competition. Further exploration based on the whole sample and information about test subjects selection are extense but necessary to disentagle these issues. Finally, artifacts related to head and micro movements inside the scanner have been gaining attention in resting state research. Some studies (', 'The ADHD-200 completion is only the beginning of a new era of data and expertise sharing. Since the consortium has already released the complete data, we expect a big wave of studies using sophisticated data mining methods over the next few years. These studies will offer a detailed investigation of yet unexplored characteristics of neuroimaging data, which will play a crucial role to define more sensitive/specific features and also to develop new feature extraction methods. In this study, only three feature extraction methods were evaluated (ReHo, fALFF, and ICA) but other approaches can also be applied to the same data. In addition, although most classifiers have shown approximately the same performance, the accuracy was more dependent on the features, highlighting how crucial is the choice of the predictor variables. Finally, we hope that the ADHD-200 competition has inaugurated a new paradigm in Neuroscience research, strongly founded on public data sharing and interdisciplinary collaborations.', 'The authors are very grateful to the Frontiers reviewers by their contribution, corrections, and insightful comments. In addition, we acknowledge the ADHD-200 consortium and competition organizers for releasing the data, the Neurobureau for providing the preprocessed data, the various collaborators from the scientific community who coded the processing routines, the support from Fundação de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo (FAPESP) and CNPq, Brazil.', 'http://fcon_1000.projects.nitrc.org/indi/adhd200/', 'Classification scores [sensitivity + specificity]/2 of the leave-one-subject-out (LOSO) and k-fold cross-validation (30 subjects at each fold) when training the classifiers using all released subjects by ADHD-200 competition (train and test sets)']"

Graph description measures may be useful as predictor variables in classification procedures. Here, we consider several centrality measures as predictor features in a classification algorithm to identify nodes of resting-state networks containing predictive information that can discriminate between typical developing children and patients with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). The prediction was based on a support vector machines classifier. The analyses were performed in a multisite and publicly available resting-state fMRI dataset of healthy children and ADHD patients: the ADHD-200 database. Network centrality measures contained little predictive information for the discrimination between ADHD patients and healthy subjects. However, the classification between inattentive and combined ADHD subtypes was more promising, achieving accuracies higher than 65% (balance between sensitivity and specificity) in some sites. Finally, brain regions were ranked according to the amount of discriminant information and the most relevant were mapped. As hypothesized, we found that brain regions in motor, frontoparietal, and default mode networks contained the most predictive information. We concluded that the functional connectivity estimations are strongly dependent on the sample characteristics. Thus different acquisition protocols and clinical heterogeneity decrease the predictive values of the graph descriptors.', 'Graph theory descriptors can be used as predictor variables (i.e., features) in a machine-learning framework. Merging graph theoretical approaches and machine learning techniques might provide a better-adjusted way to scrutinize the impairment of RSNs in ADHD as well as mapping predictions to a single individual case. In this study, we investigated the use of network centrality measures as predictive features to discriminate between typical developing children and ADHD patients with both inattentive and combined presentations. In addition, we investigated possible differences between inattentive and combined ADHD groups.

Here, we introduce a simple method to classify ADHD based on morphological information without using functional data. Our test results show that the accuracy of this approach is competitive with methods based on rs-fMRI data. We used isotropic local binary patterns on three orthogonal planes (LBP-TOP) to extract features from MR brain images. Subsequently, support vector machines (SVM) were used to develop classification models based on the extracted features. In this study, a total of 436 male subjects (210 with ADHD and 226 controls) were analyzed to show the discriminative power of the method. To analyze the properties of this approach, we tested disparate LBP-TOP features from various parcellations and different image resolutions. Additionally, morphological information using a single brain tissue type (i.e., gray matter (GM), white matter (WM), and CSF) was tested. The highest accuracy we achieved was 0.6995. The LBP-TOP was found to provide better discriminative power using whole-brain data as the input. Datasets with higher resolution can train models with increased accuracy. The information from GM plays a more important role than that of other tissue types. These results and the properties of LBP-TOP suggest that most of the disparate feature distribution comes from different patterns of cortical folding. Using LBP-TOP, we provide an ADHD classification model based only on anatomical information, which is easier to obtain in the clinical environment and which is simpler to preprocess compared with rs-fMRI data.', '). However, an objective biological tool to diagnose ADHD is still unavailable. Foreseeing the importance, the organizers of the ADHD-200 Global Competition have collected functional and anatomical ADHD MRI datasets of an unprecedented scale, which are accessible via the Internet (', 'http://fcon_1000.projects.nitrc.org/indi/adhd200/', 'During the ADHD-200 global competition, we tried many strategies to discriminate ADHD patients from control subjects based on resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) and anatomical brain image data. We found that the brain morphological changes described by a 3D texture analysis can be used to distinguish children with ADHD from typically developing children (TDC). These structural image-based models demonstrated similar accuracy compared with our models based on rs-fMRI data. In the present study, we describe and analyze the 3D texture analysis method.', '). Male data from the Kennedy Krieger Institute (KKI), the NeuroIMAGE sample (NeuroIMAGE), the New York University Child Study Center (NYU), Oregon Health and Science University (OHSU), Peking University (Peking_1, Peking_2, and Peking_3), and the University of Pittsburgh (Pittsburgh) were selected for analysis in this study. We ruled out using the dataset from Washington University because it was not in the test set of the ADHD-200 global competition and no ADHD subject in it. Five subjects (0010016, 0010027, 0010055, 0010098, and 0010127) in the NYU dataset were excluded because no anatomical data existed for them. Subject 0010013 in the NYU dataset was also excluded because some of the brain in the anatomical image was cropped during the face removal process. ADHD hyperactive-type subjects were excluded due to the small number of such subjects in the dataset.', '. The detailed phenotype of each subject can be found on the website for the ADHD-200 global competition (', 'http://fcon_1000.projects.nitrc.org/indi/adhd200/', ') and can also be found on the Athena preprocessing strategies page of the ADHD-200 preprocessed data website: ', 'To compare the results of discriminative models based on rs-fMRI data, we used a simple and easily repeatable approach. Briefly, for the preprocessing of rs-fMRI data, we used the extracted timecourses from the Athena preprocessed data, which can be download from the ADHD-200 Preprocessed Data website. Details of the specific preprocessing steps can be found on the website.', 'The timecourses of the AAL and CC200 parcellations used in LBP-TOP study were chosen for comparison. The extracted timecourses files, ADHD200_AAL_TCs_filtfix.tar.gz and ADHD200_CC200_TCs_filtfix.tar.gz, can be found on the ADHD-200 Preprocessed Data website. The correlation coefficients between each pair of regions were computed based on their extracted timecourses. For example, there are 116 regions in the AAL parcellation. Therefore, 6670 correlation coefficients can be computed based on the 6670 ROI pairs. All the correlation coefficients were used as features for the linear SVM ADHD classifier. The results of each model were validated using the same cross-validation settings used in the LBP-TOP studies. As described on the ADHD-200 Preprocessed Data website, the nuisance variance for the extracted time series of each region was removed, with or without use of a band-pass filter (0.009 Hz–0.08 Hz), and blurred with a 6 mm FWHM Gaussian filter. Both time series, with or without filtering by a band-pass filter, were tested.', '). Based on our experience in the ADHD-200 Global Competition, different preprocessing settings can affect the resulting accuracy. Moreover, combining the results of different rs-fMRI approaches can provide better discriminative power. The results of these simple approaches can be viewed as the baseline of discriminative power that rs-fMRI data can achieve.', 'The ADHD-200 global competition dataset was pooled from research sites all over the world. The organizers of the competition went to great lengths to maintain the consistency of the dataset. Nevertheless, for various historical reasons, including the use of different benchmarks at each site, it is difficult to use the same procedure to diagnose ADHD around the world (Table ', 'While constructing classification models based on machine learning approaches, the inconsistency of diagnostic criteria may introduce so-called class label noise, which may seriously diminish accuracy. Class label noise may be the most important contributor to low accuracy in the ADHD-200 Global Competition.', 'In this study, we approached the ADHD classification problem by working to find a simple method that could provide sufficient discriminative power. We determined that information derived from texture analysis of brain morphology could be used to distinguish ADHD from TDC subjects. An approach based on structural images is simpler than one based on functional data, and the data are easier to obtain making such an approach potentially more useful in the clinical environment. Our results demonstrate that structural brain data may be another treasure-trove in the ADHD-200 global competition dataset.']"

First, it is one of the most commonly found childhood disorders and second, the root cause of the problem is still unknown. Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) data has become a popular tool for the analysis of ADHD, which is the focus of our current research. In this paper we propose a novel framework for the automatic classification of the ADHD subjects using their resting state fMRI (rs-fMRI) data of the brain. We construct brain functional connectivity networks for all the subjects. The nodes of the network are constructed with clusters of highly active voxels and edges between any pair of nodes represent the correlations between their average fMRI time series. The activity level of the voxels are measured based on the average power of their corresponding fMRI time-series. For each node of the networks, a local descriptor comprising of a set of attributes of the node is computed. Next, the Multi-Dimensional Scaling (MDS) technique is used to project all the subjects from the unknown graph-space to a low dimensional space based on their inter-graph distance measures. Finally, the Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier is used on the low dimensional projected space for automatic classification of the ADHD subjects. Exhaustive experimental validation of the proposed method is performed using the data set released for the ADHD-200 competition. Our method shows promise as we achieve impressive classification accuracies on the training (70.49%) and test data sets (73.55%). Our results reveal that the detection rates are higher when classification is performed separately on the male and female groups of subjects.', ' for the classification of the ADHD subjects. Recently, there was a global competition (ADHD-200) organized, involving researchers from different scientific disciplines, for automatic diagnosis of ADHD subjects as well as understanding the underlying pathophysiology. For this purpose the organizers released a large data-set containing rs-fMRI data, sMRI data and phenotypic information of ADHD and control subjects. Different automatic classification methods were published using this data-set (', 'As discussed, researchers have identified considerable differences between the ADHD and control groups while analyzing rs-fMRI data. This motivates us to use the rs-fMRI data of the ADHD-200 competition data set for the validation of our proposed classification algorithm. Use of data from other modalities like structural MRI and phenotypic information might improve the classification accuracies but our aim is to verify the effectiveness of rs-fMRI data only for solving the proposed problem.

Early studies were unaware of the vulnerability of this method to even minor degrees of head motion, a major concern in the field. Recent efforts are implementing various strategies to address this source of artifact along with a growing set of analytical tools. Availability of the ADHD-200 Consortium dataset, a large-scale multi-site repository, is facilitating increasingly sophisticated approaches. In parallel, investigators are beginning to explicitly test the replicability of published findings. In this narrative review, we sketch out broad, overarching hypotheses being entertained while noting methodological uncertainties. Current hypotheses implicate the interplay of default, cognitive control (frontoparietal) and attention (dorsal, ventral, salience) networks in ADHD; functional connectivities of reward-related and amygdala-related circuits are also supported as substrates for dimensional aspects of ADHD. Before these can be further specified and definitively tested, we assert the field must take on the challenge of mapping the ""topography"" of the analytical space, i.e., determining the sensitivities of results to variations in acquisition, analysis, demographic and phenotypic parameters. Doing so with openly available datasets will provide the needed foundation for delineating typical and atypical developmental trajectories of brain structure and function in neurodevelopmental disorders including ADHD when applied to large-scale multi-site prospective longitudinal studies such as the forthcoming Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development study.']"

The thalamus and basal ganglia form circuits with the cortex supporting all three of these behavioral domains. Abnormalities in the structure of subcortical regions may suggest atypical development of these networks, with implications for understanding the neural basis of ASD symptoms. Findings from previous volumetric studies have been inconsistent. Here, using advanced surface-based methodology, we investigated localized differences in shape and surface area in the basal ganglia and thalamus in ASD, using T1-weighted anatomical images from the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange (373 male participants aged 7–35 years with ASD and 384 typically developing). We modeled effects of diagnosis, age, and their interaction on volume, shape, and surface area. In participants with ASD, we found expanded surface area in the right posterior thalamus corresponding to the pulvinar nucleus, and a more concave shape in the left mediodorsal nucleus. The shape of both caudal putamen and pallidum showed a relatively steeper increase in concavity with age in ASD. Within ASD participants, restricted, repetitive behaviors were positively associated with surface area in bilateral globus pallidus. We found no differences in overall volume, suggesting that surface-based approaches have greater sensitivity to detect localized differences in subcortical structure. This work adds to a growing body of literature implicating corticobasal ganglia-thalamic circuits in the pathophysiology of ASD. These circuits subserve a range of cognitive, emotional, and motor functions, and may have a broad role in the complex symptom profile in ASD.', 'The rationale for the present study is that as the basal ganglia and thalamus are central to many behaviors affected in ASD, these regions may undergo atypical development at the cellular level. Surface modeling offers the opportunity to identify localized structural abnormalities that may reflect differences in cellular development; these in turn may impact how these regions form structural connections to the broader networks supporting affected behaviors. In the present study, we compared structure of thalamus, pallidum, and striatum of males with and without ASD between the ages of 7 and 35 years, using data from a large multisite sample (Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE); ']"

Longitudinal studies following the progression of disease have to consider the variability induced by software and hardware upgrades to the MRI scanner. Additional complications arise when incorporating scanners from different vendors, field strengths, software levels, and coil architecture. Careful investigation of the test-retest reliability and image quality of inter- or intra- scanner neuroimaging measurements are critical in the statistical analysis and interpretation of results. Previously, such studies have focused on a single imaging methodology specific metric: e.g. Cortical thickness based on T1 (Wonderlick et al., 2009), temporal Signal-to-Noise Ratio (Parrish et al., 2000) and FA values based on DTI (Vollmar et al, 2010).']"

The altered voxel-wise and regional-wise resting state active patterns under EO/EC were found by static analysis. More importantly, dynamical spontaneous functional connectivity has been observed in the resting brain. To the best of our knowledge, the dynamical mechanisms of intrinsic connectivity networks (ICNs) under EO/EC remain largely unexplored. The goals of this paper were twofold: 1) investigating the dynamical intra-ICN and inter-ICN temporal patterns during resting state; 2) analyzing the altered dynamical temporal patterns of ICNs under EO/EC. To this end, a cohort of healthy subjects with scan conditions of EO/EC were recruited from 1000 Functional Connectomes Project. Through Hilbert transform, time-varying phase synchronization (PS) was applied to evaluate the inter-ICN synchrony. Meanwhile, time-varying amplitude was analyzed as dynamical intra-ICN temporal patterns. The results found six micro-states of inter-ICN synchrony. The medial visual network (MVN) showed decreased intra-ICN amplitude during EC relative to EO. The sensory-motor network (SMN) and auditory network (AN) exhibited enhanced intra-ICN amplitude during EC relative to EO. Altered inter-ICN PS was found between certain ICNs. Particularly, the SMN and AN exhibited enhanced PS to other ICNs during EC relative to EO. In addition, the intra-ICN amplitude might influence the inter-ICN synchrony. Moreover, default mode network (DMN) might play an important role in information processing during EO/EC. Together, the dynamical temporal patterns within and between ICNs were altered during different scan conditions of EO/EC. Overall, the dynamical intra-ICN and inter-ICN temporal patterns could benefit resting state fMRI-related research, and could be potential biomarkers for human functional connectome.', 'All relevant data are available from the International Neuroimaging Data-Sharing Initiative (INDI) database (', 'http://fcon_1000.projects.nitrc.org/indi/retro/BeijingEOEC.html', 'Based on the above studies, we reasoned that the ICNs might exhibit characteristic dynamical functional connectivity under resting states of EO/EC, and hypothesized that the altered dynamical temporal patterns could be discovered with resting state synchrony. To this end, a cohort of health subjects with resting state fMRI datasets of EO/EC states were recruited from the 1000 Functional Connectomes Project. First, the time-courses of ICNs were extracted from the spatially normalized 4D functional volumes. Then, the micro-states of synchrony between ICNs were analyzed through unsupervised learning. Finally, the altered dynamical temporal patterns within and between ICNs were determined to explore the network mechanisms of EO/EC.', '].

However, it is still questionable whether the source of functional under-connectivity in subjects with ASD is equally contributed by the ipsilateral and contralateral parts of the brain. In this study, we decomposed the inter- and intra-hemispheric regions and compared the functional connectivity density (FCD) between 458 subjects with ASD and 517 TDCs from the ABIDE database. We quantified the inter- and intra-hemispheric FCDs in the brain by counting the number of functional connectivity with all voxels in the opposite and same hemispheric brain regions, respectively. Relative to TDCs, both inter- and intra-hemispheric FCDs in the posterior cingulate cortex, lingual/parahippocampal gyrus, and postcentral gyrus were significantly decreased in subjects with ASD. Moreover, in the ASD group, the restricted and repetitive behavior subscore of the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS-RRB) score showed significant negative correlations with the average inter-hemispheric FCD and contralateral FCD in the lingual/parahippocampal gyrus cluster. Also, the ADOS-RRB score showed significant negative correlations with the average contralateral FCD in the default mode network regions such as the posterior cingulate cortex and precuneus. Taken together, our findings imply that a deficit of non-social functioning processing in ASD such as restricted and repetitive behaviors and sensory hypersensitivity could be determined via both inter- and intra-hemispheric functional disconnections.', 'Due to the diverse symptoms and complexity of ASD, a large dataset is needed to investigate the characteristic features of ASD. Recently, the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE) collected 1112 resting state functional MRI datasets of subjects with ASD and typically developing control (TDC) subjects from 17 international sites. Previously, large datasets from multiple centers have been successfully analyzed to identify features of the functional human brain (', ').

The functional connectivity is often quantified by statistical metrics (e.g., Pearson correlation coefficient), which may be affected by many image acquisition and preprocessing steps such as the head motion correction and the global signal regression. The appropriate quantification of the connectivity metrics is essential for meaningful and reproducible scientific findings. We propose a novel empirical Bayes method to normalize the functional brain connectivity metrics on a posterior probability scale. Moreover, the normalization function maps the original connectivity metrics to values between zero and one, which is well-suited for the graph theory based network analysis and avoids the information loss due to the (negative value) hard thresholding step. We apply the normalization method to a simulation study and the simulation results show that our normalization method effectively improves the robustness and reliability of the quantification of brain functional connectivity and provides more powerful group difference (biomarkers) detection. We illustrate our method on an analysis of a rs-fMRI dataset from the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE) study.', 'This data set was collected at Brain Mapping Center in University of California, Los Angles (UCLA), one of the data collecting sites in the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE) (', 'http://fcon_1000.projects.nitrc.org/indi/abide/']"

We used the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE) sample to analyze locally focal (~8\u2009mm) functional connectivity of 223 autism patients and 285 normal controls from 15 international sites using a recently developed surface-based approach. We observed enhanced local connectivity in the middle frontal cortex, left precuneus, and right superior temporal sulcus, and reduced local connectivity in the right insular cortex. The local connectivity in the right middle frontal gyrus was positively correlated with the total score of the autism diagnostic observation schedule whereas the local connectivity within the right superior temporal sulcus was positively correlated with total subscores of both the communication and the stereotyped behaviors and restricted interests of the schedule. Finally, significant interactions between age and clinical diagnosis were detected in the left precuneus. These findings replicated previous observations that used a volume-based approach and suggested possible neuropathological impairments of local information processing in the frontal, temporal, parietal, and insular cortices. Novel site-variability analysis demonstrated high reproducibility of our findings across the 15 international sites.

The second stated reason was the computational demands that a higher resolution would require: while the voxelwise network at a 4 mm resolution had 22,387 nodes, this number would increase to 42,835 when using a 3 mm resolution.

However, there are only few efficient approaches for integrating functional connectivity pattern across subjects, while accounting for spatial-temporal functional variation across multiple groups of subjects. The objective of this paper is to develop a new sparse reduced rank (SRR) modeling framework for carrying out functional connectivity analysis across multiple groups of subjects in the frequency domain. Our new framework not only can extract both frequency and spatial factors across subjects, but also imposes sparse constraints on the frequency factors. It thus leads to the identification of important frequencies with high power spectra. In addition, we propose two novel adaptive criteria for automatic selection of sparsity level and model rank. Using simulated data, we demonstrate that SRR outperforms several existing methods. Finally, we apply SRR to detect group differences between controls and two subtypes of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) patients, through analyzing the ADHD-200 data.']"

For example, the recent competition announced by the ADHD-200 Consortium aimed to develop various types of supervised or modified versions of classical learning algorithms to distinguish ADHD from typically developing children (TDC) using resting state functional imaging datasets from large samples [', 'The preprocessed resting state fMRI data was obtained from the ADHD-200 Consortium website (', 'http://fcon_1000.projects.nitrc.org/indi/adhd200', '). We selected datasets from New York University (NYU) and Peking University (PU) for our study because these two institutes have the largest data samples among the ADHD-200 database and these datasets include equal amount of patients with ADHD and TDC. The NYU dataset includes 98 TDC and 118 children with ADHD. The PU dataset includes 116 TDC and 78 children with ADHD. Psychiatric diagnoses, including comorbidity information, were established through psychiatric interviews with experienced child psychiatrists using the Schedule of Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for Children-Present and Lifetime Version administered to parents and children (NYU and PU) and the Conners’ Parent Rating Scale-Revised, Long Version (NYU) or the ADHD Rating Scale IV (PU). Symptom severity such as inattention and hyperactivity/impulsivity and the ADHD index, which is an overall measure of ADHD symptom severity, were rated by parents. Intelligence was evaluated with the Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence (NYU) or the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Chinese Children-Revised (PU). The details for the phenotypic and clinical variables are described elsewhere [', 'Briefly, for the construction of the functional network, we used the extracted time courses from the Athena preprocessed data. A detailed description of the preprocessing steps can be found in the Supporting Information as well as on the Athena website. The filtered time course files, ADHD200_AAL_TCs_filtfix.tar.gz, can be downloaded from the ADHD-200 Preprocessed Data website. The functional network of each subject (', 'The results mentioned above should be interpreted with caution with the following limitations in mind. First, the ADHD-200 data have site-specific differences in behavioral measurement, imaging data acquisition, scanner quality and protocols, and subject populations from the site contributing to the data. To overcome these problems, we analyzed the NYU and PU dataset separately, and mainly presented the results from the NYU site for this study (', '). Nonetheless, the comparison of the NYU dataset with the independent PU dataset produced very similar results, except for the one result regarding the association between the value of the filter function and ADHD symptoms. Thus, the methodologies we propose may be considered as relatively unaffected by these sources of variation and bias caused by differences between study samples. Second, two groups were successfully identified on the basis of brain imaging data, such as the magnitude of the disease component, but phenotypic information such as gender, age, and medication status were not included in the topological data analysis. The demographic information may also contribute greatly to the disease classification, as shown in the competition results from the ADHD-200 dataset, which shows that diagnosis based on demographic variables outperforms imaging-based diagnostic prediction. Third, additional interaction effects of disease duration and medication may further impact the neurobiological substrate in specific ways [', 'The ADHD-200 Consortium.

The scientific community is still lacking a pathophysiological model of the disorder and there are no objective biomarkers to support the diagnosis. In 2011 the ADHD-200 Consortium provided a rich, heterogeneous neuroimaging dataset aimed at studying neural correlates of ADHD and to promote the development of systems for automated diagnosis. Concurrently a competition was set up with the goal of addressing the wide range of different types of data for the accurate prediction of the presence of ADHD. Phenotypic information, structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans and resting state fMRI recordings were provided for nearly 1000 typical and non-typical young individuals. Data were collected by eight different research centers in the consortium. This work is not concerned with the main task of the contest, i.e., achieving a high prediction accuracy on the competition dataset, but we rather address the proper handling of such a heterogeneous dataset when performing classification-based analysis. Our interest lies in the clustered structure of the data causing the so-called ', ' which have strong impact when assessing the performance of classifiers built on the ADHD-200 dataset. We propose a method to eliminate the biases introduced by such batch effects. Its application on the ADHD-200 dataset generates such a significant drop in prediction accuracy that most of the conclusions from a standard analysis had to be revised. In addition we propose to adopt the dissimilarity representation to set up effective representation spaces for the heterogeneous ADHD-200 dataset. Moreover we propose to evaluate the quality of predictions through a recently proposed test of independence in order to cope with the unbalancedness of the dataset.', 'In 2011 the ADHD-200 Initiative', ' promoted the collection of a very large dataset about the Attention Defict Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) in the young population. Concurrently a related competition, called ADHD-200 Global Competition, was set up to foster the creation of automatic systems to diagnose ADHD. The motivation of the ADHD-200 Initiative was that, despite a large literature of empirical studies, the scientific community had not reached a comprehensive model of the disorder and the clinical community lacked objective biomarkers to support the diagnosis.', 'The main aspect of the ADHD-200 dataset is its size. It represents one of the major efforts in the area of publicly available neuroimaging datasets concerned with a specific aim. The large size of the dataset is structured along two lines: the number of subjects and the types of data available for each subject. The dataset includes nearly 1000 subjects divided among typically developing controls and patients with different levels of ADHD, i.e., ', 'Analyzing the heterogeneous ADHD-200 dataset for the goal of the competition generates many difficulties. First of all the different types of data have to be transformed into a homogeneous vectorial representation space because this is a requirement for the majority of the most popular classification algorithms (', '). The third kind of difficulty in analyzing the ADHD-200 dataset is its unbalanced distribution of the subjects in the diagnostic groups. Table ', ' reports that in the ADHD-200 dataset there are 575 typically developing subjects, 144 inattentive, 9 hyperactive, and 204 combined. In section 3 we will show that in unbalanced cases the standard statistic of prediction accuracy can be misleading to understand the actual performance of the classifier and that new methods should be adopted.', 'Table 1. Subjects distribution of the ADHD-200 dataset with respect to the sites', ') as a mean to construct a common representation space for all the heterogeneous types of data available in the ADHD-200 dataset. In the dissimilarity space representation the data from a given source, e.g., the structural MRI scan of a subject, are projected into a vector just by providing a source-specific distance function. Once the data of all sources of a subject are transformed into vectors, they can be concatenated into a larger vector that represents a homogeneous description of the subject over multiple data sources.', '. The structure of the ADHD-200 dataset presents the same two levels of batch effect modeled in ', 'The third issue, i.e., assessing the performance of the classifier on the unbalanced ADHD-200 dataset, is addressed by testing the statistical dependence between the predictions and the actual diagnostic group of each subject. We draw from the statistics literature and adopt a recent Bayesian test of independence for contingency tables (', 'The structure of this paper is the following. In section 2 we describe the ADHD-200 dataset and part of the publicly available pre-processing pipelines from which we started our analysis. In section 3 we describe the three main ingredients of our work, i.e., the dissimilarity representation, the model of the batch effects and the test of independence to assess whether and how the proposed classification system was able to discriminate ADHD subjects from healthy subjects. In section 4 we illustrate the experiments we conducted with all the necessary details to implement the proposed methods. To conclude, in section 5 we discuss the results of our experiments and we show that the postulated batch effects are the major contribution in the apparently positive classification results.', 'Our study refers to the ADHD-200 initiative and dataset. The initiative is dedicated to support the scientific community in studying and understanding the neural basis of ADHD. The eight member institutions collected imaging datasets from almost 1000 young subjects (age 7–26) with and without ADHD, see Table ', '. The ADHD-200 dataset is publicly available and freely distributed with the support of the International Neuroimaging Data-sharing Initiative', 'In 2011 the ADHD-200 initiative set up a global competition to develop diagnostic classification systems for ADHD diagnosis based on structural and fMRI data of the brain. Even though the ADHD-200 dataset comprised three different levels of the ADHD disorder and the healthy subjects, the competition was designed to discriminate only among three categories: typically developing, ADHD combined, and ADHD inattentive', 'In 2011 the ADHD-200 dataset was delivered in two stages the first part to be considered as the train set for the construction of classifiers and the second part as test set for performance evaluation. In this work we consider only the aggregation of the two parts as a single dataset. We will discuss how we split it into train set and test set only in section 4 after the introduction of the batch effect model and the related performance estimation processes.', 'Table 2. Details on resting state fMRI recordings in the ADHD-200 dataset with respect to the sites', ' that provides high-quality and publicly available preprocessed versions of the ADHD-200 dataset in order to facilitate the development of algorithms for data analysis. Among the different pipelines supported by the Neuro Bureau initiative we focused on the data computed by the Burner and the Athena pipelines', 'The ADHD-200 dataset is the aggregation of datasets collected by multiple institutions. Moreover in the ADHD-200 dataset multiple fMRI resting state recordings are available for many of the subjects involved in the study. These facts motivate why at least two levels of batch effects should be expected. First each site is expected to have its own specificity about the collected MRI data and the specific sample of subjects selected for the study. MRI hardware specifications of each site, the actual MRI sequences used, the local ADHD and healthy population addressed and the local best practices at each step of the collection process are examples of the site specificity. A second-level of batch effect arises because in this work we consider each available run of fMRI recordings as a new example to be used for improving the classification step. This choice ', 'We used the dissimilarity representation to create a vectorial description of each subject of the ADHD-200 dataset for each available data source. A classification algorithm was then trained to assess the ADHD-related information in each data source. In a further group of experiments the vectors from multiple data sources of each subject were concatenated into a higher dimensional vector to extract information about the joint effect of multiple data sources. In all cases the evaluation of the classifier for discriminating among the classes of interest, i.e., controls and ADHD patients, was assessed through a statistical test.', 'In this section we describe the detailed implementation of the methods illustrated in section 3 on the ADHD-200 dataset for the goal of discriminating typical from non-typical subjects. We first describe the pre-processing steps to create preliminary representations of the initial measurements, i.e., T1 structural MRI, REHO, and SMR volumes from resting state fMRI recordings, motion and phenotypic information, as described in section 2. Then we describe the distance function for each data source that was used to create the dissimilarity representation along with the selection of the number of prototypes. After the construction of the representation space we mention the classification algorithm that we used in this work and we describe the three train/testing processes that we designed to assess the importance of each data source for the prediction of the clinical group and the importance of the batch effects.', ' also address the ADHD-200 Global Competition by using all available data sources for ADHD diagnosis. The analysis is conducted both for the whole set of data sources jointly and for the set of the four most informative data sources according to Table ', 'We claim that the major challenges of having large datasets in the neuroscience domain, like the ADHD-200 dataset, are not just related to the inherent difficulties of data collection but they also involve the analysis and the interpretation of the results. This work provides some of the essential tools for moving toward the successful analysis of such datasets.', 'The authors would like to thank the ADHD-200 Initiative for providing the ADHD-200 data and setting up the Global Competition. We are grateful to the NeuroBureau Initiative for providing the preprocessed version of the ADHD-200 data and specifically to Cameron Craddock for the Athena pipeline and to Carlton Chu for the Burner pipeline.', 'http://fcon_1000.projects.nitrc.org/indi/adhd200', 'http://fcon_1000.projects.nitrc.org/indi/adhd200']"

Consistent with the initial ABIDE effort (ABIDE I), that released 1112 datasets in 2012, this new multisite open-data resource is an aggregate of resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and corresponding structural MRI and phenotypic datasets. ABIDE II includes datasets from an additional 487 individuals with ASD and 557 controls previously collected across 16 international institutions. The combination of ABIDE I and ABIDE II provides investigators with 2156 unique cross-sectional datasets allowing selection of samples for discovery and/or replication. This sample size can also facilitate the identification of neurobiological subgroups, as well as preliminary examinations of sex differences in ASD. Additionally, ABIDE II includes a range of psychiatric variables to inform our understanding of the neural correlates of co-occurring psychopathology; 284 diffusion imaging datasets are also included. It is anticipated that these enhancements will contribute to unraveling key sources of ASD heterogeneity.', '.

This was based both on strength and interhemispheric connectivity maps obtained via normalized co-activation matrices (derived from the point-process) and standard linear correlation matrices. We applied a 5-fold cross validation procedure combined with feature selection (', ' and in the methods section. In the case of the 1000 Functional Connectomes dataset we repeated calculations both for voxel-wise networks and for networks based on time series extracted from the AAL template. Using this data, we first evaluated the similitude in the estimation of the connectivity matrix by both methods (point-process analysis with normalization and linear correlations) as a function of the threshold γ used to define the point-process (see Equation 2). Results are shown in Figure ', ' as a function of the threshold [γ in Equation (2); mean ± SEM].

Thus, this very sparse representation of fMRI data contained sufficient information to capture all the differences during deep sleep and in the 1000 Functional Connectomes dataset (see below), requiring but a small fraction of the original time series. Specifically, the required information consists of the (discrete) timings of the events in the point-process (i.e., at which volumes the “points” appear).', 'We then studied changes in node strength in the 1000 Functional Connectomes dataset, in particular, we compared a group of subjects younger than 20 years with an older group of subjects older than 40 years.

In this latter dataset we also obtained the distribution of voxel-wise inter-hemispheric connectivity. The maps of altered network strength in deep sleep and the age-dependent effect observed in the 1000 Functional Connectomes dataset are of biological relevance themselves, as we are not aware of prior reports of these results. Deep sleep resulted in a loss of connectivity across all voxels located in frontal and cingulate cortices, as well as in the primary auditory cortex (Heschl's gyrus) and the thalamus. These are plausible correlates of reduced awareness (frontal and cingulate cortex) and loss of sensory engagement with the environment (primary auditory cortex and thalamus) resulting in increased arousal thresholds ("", 'With respect to the two different age groups extracted from the 1000 Functional Connectomes database, regions central to working memory processes (inferior parietal and frontal cortices, prefrontal cortex) showed “over-connectivity” in the older group of subjects.

With this transition from the traditional group level difference investigations to single-subject inference, the application of machine learning methods can be seen as a considerable step forward. Existing studies, however, have given scarce or no information on the generalizability to other subject samples, limiting the use of such published classifiers in other research projects. We conducted a simulation study using publicly available resting-state fMRI data from the 1000 Functional Connectomes and COBRE projects to examine the generalizability of classifiers based on regional homogeneity of resting-state time series. While classification accuracies of up to 0.8 (using sex as the target variable) could be achieved on test datasets drawn from the same study as the training dataset, the generalizability of classifiers to different study samples proved to be limited albeit above chance. This shows that on the one hand a certain amount of generalizability can robustly be expected, but on the other hand this generalizability should not be overestimated. Indeed, this study substantiates the need to include data from several sites in a study investigating machine learning classifiers with the aim of generalizability.', ""Data for simulations were downloaded from the 1000 Functional Connectomes (FCon) and COBRE projects, and all samples of healthy adult subjects with available demographics, anatomical and functional data (otherwise classification could not be performed) were included in the analysis. This means that the datasets AnnArbor_a, Milwaukee_a, NewYork_a, NewYork_a_ADHD, Ontario, Taipei_a, and Taipei_b as well as the patient group from the COBRE dataset were excluded. In addition, six subjects from the Beijing_Zang dataset were excluded because the readme file of the study indicated potential technical problems with those subjects' data, leaving 1170 single-subject datasets for analysis (for details, see Table "", 'This study was financially supported by the Austrian Science Fund (project numbers P22813 and P23533) and by funds of the Oesterreichische Nationalbank (Anniversary Fund, project number 13890).

However, the state-of-the-art fMRI informatics systems are especially designed for specific fMRI sessions or studies of which the data size is not really big, and thus has difficulty in handling fMRI 'big data.' Given the size of fMRI data are growing explosively recently due to the advancement of neuroimaging technologies, an effective and efficient fMRI informatics system which can process and analyze fMRI big data is much needed. To address this challenge, in this work, we introduce our newly developed informatics platform, namely, 'HAFNI-enabled largescale platform for neuroimaging informatics (HELPNI).' HELPNI implements our recently developed computational framework of sparse representation of whole-brain fMRI signals which is called holistic atlases of functional networks and interactions (HAFNI) for fMRI data analysis. HELPNI provides integrated solutions to archive and process large-scale fMRI data automatically and structurally, to extract and visualize meaningful results information from raw fMRI data, and to share open-access processed and raw data with other collaborators through web. We tested the proposed HELPNI platform using publicly available 1000 Functional Connectomes dataset including over 1200 subjects. We identified consistent and meaningful functional brain networks across individuals and populations based on resting state fMRI (rsfMRI) big data. Using efficient sampling module, the experimental results demonstrate that our HELPNI system has superior performance than other systems for large-scale fMRI data in terms of processing and storing the data and associated results much faster.""]"

This procedure can be useful for calculating brain volume and for improving the quality of other image processing steps. Developing new skull-stripping algorithms and evaluating their performance requires gold standard data from a variety of different scanners and acquisition methods. We complement existing repositories with manually corrected brain masks for 125 T1-weighted anatomical scans from the Nathan Kline Institute Enhanced Rockland Sample Neurofeedback Study.FindingsSkull-stripped images were obtained using a semi-automated procedure that involved skull-stripping the data using the brain extraction based on nonlocal segmentation technique (BEaST) software, and manually correcting the worst results. Corrected brain masks were added into the BEaST library and the procedure was repeated until acceptable brain masks were available for all images. In total, 85 of the skull-stripped images were hand-edited and 40 were deemed to not need editing. The results are brain masks for the 125 images along with a BEaST library for automatically skull-stripping other data.ConclusionSkull-stripped anatomical images from the Neurofeedback sample are available for download from the Preprocessed Connectomes Project. The resulting brain masks can be used by researchers to improve preprocessing of the Neurofeedback data, as training and testing data for developing new skull-stripping algorithms, and for evaluating the impact on other aspects of MRI preprocessing.

These included individuals with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and healthy-controls in shared data from the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE) and the Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD-200) databases.

A power-law emerged describing an orderly relation between the dispersion and shape of the probability distribution functions best describing the stochastic properties under consideration with respect to intelligence quotient (IQ-scores). In ASD, deleterious patterns of noise are consistently exacerbated with the presence of secondary (comorbid) neuropsychiatric diagnoses, lower verbal and performance intelligence, and autism severity. Importantly, such patterns in ASD are present whether or not the participant takes psychotropic medication.

In this study, we performed multiclass classification using a hierarchical extreme learning machine (H-ELM) classifier. We compared the performance of this classifier with that of a support vector machine (SVM) and basic extreme learning machine (ELM) for cortical MRI data from attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) patients. We used 159 structural MRI images of children from the publicly available ADHD-200 MRI dataset. The data consisted of three types, namely, typically developing (TDC), ADHD-inattentive (ADHD-I), and ADHD-combined (ADHD-C). We carried out feature selection by using standard SVM-based recursive feature elimination (RFE-SVM) that enabled us to achieve good classification accuracy (60.78%). In this study, we found the RFE-SVM feature selection approach in combination with H-ELM to effectively enable the acquisition of high multiclass classification accuracy rates for structural neuroimaging data. In addition, we found that the most important features for classification were the surface area of the superior frontal lobe, and the cortical thickness, volume, and mean surface area of the whole cortex.', 'All the MRI files are available from the ADHD-200 database (', 'http://fcon_1000.projects.nitrc.org/indi/adhd200', 'We obtained neuroimaging data of ADHD patients from the ADHD-200 MRI dataset, which is publicly available at ', 'http://fcon_1000.projects.nitrc.org/indi/adhd200', '. These T-1-weighted MRI scans were acquired at six different institutes with participant ages ranging from 7 to 14 years. The sites were Brown University (BU), New York University Child Study Center (NYU), Beijing Normal University (BNU), the Kennedy Krieger Institute (KKI), Oregon Health and Science University (OHSU), and Washington University in St. Louis (WU). All participants were scanned using 3.0-Tesla scanners. The other technical details about the scanner parameters from each participating site are already available at the above-mentioned URL of the ADHD-200 global competition. In addition, all the sites contributing to ADHD-200 had approval from their local institutional review board (IRB) and complied with local IRB protocols.', 'The ADHD-200 dataset included more than 1000 subjects; however, we followed a balanced design approach and only chose 53 subjects from each of the three groups: typically developing children (TDC), ADHD inattentive type (ADHD-I), and ADHD combined type (ADHD-C). The main focus of the current study was to elaborate the significance of a supervised multiclass classification between TDC, ADHD-C, and ADHD-I based on the H-ELM framework and all the subjects were chosen from the training part of the ADHD-200 dataset, which consists of 776 subjects. Each group contained 9 female and 44 male subjects. There may have existed some intrinsic bias in the data regarding batch effects as well as hardware bias due to multisite data collection [', ']. This method was successfully deployed in many previous research efforts related to ADHD-200 dataset classification, including [', 'The level-A block represents subject selection from the ADHD-200 dataset and briefly describes the preprocessing step, the level-B block provides information about the 31 DKT atlas-based ROIs, selection of the five feature measures and the total count of the cortical features. The level-C block elaborates the data validation methodologies and feature selection for the classifiers. Level-D represents the classifier choice for both the multiclass and binary settings.', 'The main result of this study was to achieve high multiclass accuracy by using the H-ELM framework on RFE-SVM-based selected features. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study in which the H-ELM framework was used for multiclass classification on structural MRI data from the ADHD-200 competition dataset. Our results suggest that we can achieve high classification accuracy between the patient and control groups. In every test setting, the H-ELM framework outperformed basic ELM and two SVM classifiers.', '], for which an accuracy of 90.18% was reported, was conducted only on subjects from the Peking University contribution to the ADHD-200 dataset for binary classification. In our study we used H-ELM, which is the most advanced classification framework for both binary and multiclass classification and has not been used by any other neuroimaging study to date. This framework has the benefit of an embedded ELM-based sparse feature autoencoder. Although the performance of the basic ELM classifier was found to be superior to that of the SVMs, it exhibits lower performance than H-ELM in every setting for both binary and multiclass classification. On the other hand, in a recent study by [', ' in the ADHD-200 competition. However, our results showed higher performance than any study on ADHD in multiclass classification settings by using only structural data, to the best of our knowledge. We used a balanced design approach to select the number of subjects (53 from each diagnosis group) from the ADHD-200 dataset. Among the aforementioned studies, there is no other similar experimental setting for multiclass classification of MRI cortical data; therefore, we cannot directly compare the accuracy of our results to those obtained in any previous research.', 'Authors thankfully acknowledge the ADHD-200 consortium for the released dataset.']"

How to reduce the size of fMRI data but not lose much information becomes a more and more pressing issue. Recent literature studies tried to deal with it by dictionary learning and sparse representation methods, however, their computation complexities are still high, which hampers the wider application of sparse representation method to large scale fMRI datasets. To effectively address this problem, this work proposes to represent resting state fMRI (rs-fMRI) signals of a whole brain via a statistical sampling based sparse representation. First we sampled the whole brain’s signals via different sampling methods, then the sampled signals were aggregate into an input data matrix to learn a dictionary, finally this dictionary was used to sparsely represent the whole brain’s signals and identify the resting state networks. Comparative experiments demonstrate that the proposed signal sampling framework can speed-up by ten times in reconstructing concurrent brain networks without losing much information. The experiments on the 1000 Functional Connectomes Project further demonstrate its effectiveness and superiority.']"

We list data that is available through the five resources we query whether it matches the entire query as specified, including diagnosis, or it matches the age range and gender characteristics specified for control (typically developing) subject data. The power of this approach comes not through the complexity of any one query, but rather the collection and integration of a wide variety of resource queries under one application where most of the operational details and idiosyncrasies of the of the individual resources can be initially abstracted away from the end user. Ultimately, use of these varied resources by users not intimately trained in the details of each site will be critical to wide-spread utilization of these many valued data sources.']"

In one study by G. Zheng and colleagues, resting-state fMRI was used to examine functional connectivity changes in the progression of minimal hepatic encephalopathy and found continuously impaired intra- and intermodular connectivity in patients with cirrhosis. In another study, Y.-Y. Wai and colleagues used tract-based spatial statistics of DTI to characterize white matter integrity in different subtypes of MCI, including amnestic MCI, dysexecutive MCI, AD, and healthy controls. They found that amnestic MCI and AD patients share significant white matter damage, whereas dysexecutive MCI patients appear to have a distinct pathogenesis. In the third study, A. dos Santos Siqueira and colleagues used graph theory and analyzed a resting-state fMRI data set from healthy children and ADHD patients in the ADHD-200 database. Distinct patterns of network dysfunction were evident for both inattentive and combined ADHD subtypes. However, the authors observed that the classification scores for discriminating between ADHD and healthy subjects were close to chance and that functional connectivity estimations were strongly dependent on the sample characteristics. In the final study, H. Zhu and colleagues used resting-state MEG to identify the epileptogenic and other abnormal regions in patients with left temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) and provided further evidence supporting the notion that TLE is not a focal focus but a multifocus disease.']"

However, several barriers remain. For example, the acquisition of large-scale datasets capable of clarifying the marked heterogeneity that exists in psychiatric illnesses will need to be realized. In addition, there continues to be a need for the development of image processing and analysis methods capable of separating signal from artifact. As a prototypical hyperkinetic disorder, and movement-related artifact being a significant confound in functional imaging studies, ADHD offers a unique challenge. As part of the ADHD-200 Global Competition and this special edition of Frontiers, the ADHD-200 Consortium demonstrates the utility of an aggregate dataset pooled across five institutions in addressing these challenges. The work aimed to (1) examine the impact of emerging techniques for controlling for “micro-movements,” and (2) provide novel insights into the neural correlates of ADHD subtypes. Using support vector machine (SVM)-based multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) we show that functional connectivity patterns in individuals are capable of differentiating the two most prominent ADHD subtypes. The application of graph-theory revealed that the Combined (ADHD-C) and Inattentive (ADHD-I) subtypes demonstrated some overlapping (particularly sensorimotor systems), but unique patterns of atypical connectivity. For ADHD-C, atypical connectivity was prominent in midline default network components, as well as insular cortex; in contrast, the ADHD-I group exhibited atypical patterns within the dlPFC regions and cerebellum. Systematic motion-related artifact was noted, and highlighted the need for stringent motion correction. Findings reported were robust to the specific motion correction strategy employed. These data suggest that resting-state functional connectivity MRI (rs-fcMRI) data can be used to characterize individual patients with ADHD and to identify neural distinctions underlying the clinical heterogeneity of ADHD.', '). These features make rs-fcMRI an attractive measure for translational and clinical applications. As highlighted in the ADHD-200 competition (', 'ADHD-200-Consortium, 2012', 'ADHD-200-Consortium, 2012', 'http://fcon_1000.projects.nitrc.org/indi/adhd200', '), we first provide a comprehensive examination of micro-movements in the ADHD-200 sample, as well as the impact of various correction strategies. Then, we report unique findings from our ADHD-C and ADHD-I samples, after controlling for movement using the most conservative procedure.', 'Section 1: Characterizing and Accounting for Micro-Movements in the ADHD-200 Sample', '), and in the spirit of the ADHD-200 Global Competition (', 'ADHD-200-Consortium, 2012', '), we used the large-scale aggregate ADHD-200 dataset to highlight the need for stringent micro-movement correction. The work also provides the first insights into common and distinct neural substrates of the two most common ADHD subtypes. Application of graph-theoretic metrics implicated atypical connectivity across multiple systems in the combined subtype (ADHD-C), particularly in the default network. Although similar observations were present in the predominantly inattentive subtype (ADHD-I) functional connectivity differences were more evident in bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal regions, and in the cerebellum, rather than in the default mode network. Classification analyses aimed at predicting individual diagnostic status based on patterns of functional connectivity further highlight differential neural substrates for the two subtypes, and serve to provide a vision for future clinical applications of neuroimaging.', 'We anticipate classification rates with the current ADHD-200 sample will continue to improve with optimization of supervised and unsupervised learning approaches. Optimization and extension of feature sets to include other potential markers is also likely to enhance classification. However, it is only through the future creation of a large-scale datasets, with coordinated recruitment, deep phenotyping, multimodal data acquisition (e.g., rs-fcMRI, diffusion imaging, ASL), and likely improved homogeneity in our subgrouping (', ""), which hosts the ADHD-200 Consortium's distribution site ("", 'http://fcon_1000.projects.nitrc.org/indi/adhd200', 'ADHD-200-Consortium.

The core challenge remains the development of common paradigms for interrogating the myriad functional systems\n                              in the brain without the constraints of a priori hypotheses. Resting-state functional MRI (R-fMRI) constitutes a candidate\n                              approach capable of addressing this challenge. Imaging the brain during rest reveals large-amplitude spontaneous low-frequency\n                              (<0.1 Hz) fluctuations in the fMRI signal that are temporally correlated across functionally related areas. Referred to as\n                              functional connectivity, these correlations yield detailed maps of complex neural systems, collectively constituting an individual's\n                              “functional connectome.” Reproducibility across datasets and individuals suggests the functional connectome has a common architecture,\n                              yet each individual's functional connectome exhibits unique features, with stable, meaningful interindividual differences\n                              in connectivity patterns and strengths. Comprehensive mapping of the functional connectome, and its subsequent exploitation\n                              to discern genetic influences and brain–behavior relationships, will require multicenter collaborative datasets. Here we initiate\n                              this endeavor by gathering R-fMRI data from 1,414 volunteers collected independently at 35 international centers. We demonstrate\n                              a universal architecture of positive and negative functional connections, as well as consistent loci of inter-individual variability.\n                              Age and sex emerged as significant determinants. These results demonstrate that independent R-fMRI datasets can be aggregated\n                              and shared. High-throughput R-fMRI can provide quantitative phenotypes for molecular genetic studies and biomarkers of developmental\n                              and pathological processes in the brain. To initiate discovery science of brain function, the 1000 Functional Connectomes\n                              Project dataset is freely accessible at "", 'Accordingly, the 1000 Functional Connectomes Project was formed to aggregate existing R-fMRI data from collaborating centers\n                           throughout the world and to provide an initial demonstration of the ability to pool functional data across centers. As of\n                           December 11, 2009, the repository includes data from 1,414 healthy adult participants contributed by 35 laboratories (', '. We anticipate that the open availability of the 1000 Functional Connectomes dataset will recruit the broad participation\n                              and collaboration among the scientific community necessary for successful implementation of discovery-based science of human\n                              brain function. In addition, we hope that it will further advance the ethos of data sharing and collaboration initiated by\n                              such efforts as fMRIDC (', "" for supporting the 1000 Functional Connectomes Project data release, Avi Snyder for providing helpful insights and advice\n                              concerning project goals, and Cameron Craddock for helpful advice on this study.

Consistent with the initial ABIDE effort (ABIDE I), that released 1112 datasets in 2012, this new multisite open-data resource is an aggregate of resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and corresponding structural MRI and phenotypic datasets. ABIDE II includes datasets from an additional 487 individuals with ASD and 557 controls previously collected across 16 international institutions. The combination of ABIDE I and ABIDE II provides investigators with 2156 unique cross-sectional datasets allowing selection of samples for discovery and/or replication. This sample size can also facilitate the identification of neurobiological subgroups, as well as preliminary examinations of sex differences in ASD. Additionally, ABIDE II includes a range of psychiatric variables to inform our understanding of the neural correlates of co-occurring psychopathology; 284 diffusion imaging datasets are also included. It is anticipated that these enhancements will contribute to unraveling key sources of ASD heterogeneity.', '.

Also, our result showed that there are significant relationships between degree centrality values of the frontoparietal network and IQ scores and further studies with more samples are needed to fully interpret correlation between IQ scores and centrality values. Second, we only used degree centrality as a connectivity measure. There are several other measures such as betweenness, eigenvector, and closeness centrality (', ' ADHD-200 Consortium (2012).

In this work, we develop flexible regression models and methods for determining differences in resting-state functional connectivity as a function of age, gender, drug intervention, or neuropsychiatric disorders. We propose two complementary methods for identifying changes of edges and subgraphs. (i) For detecting changes of edges, we select the optimal model at each edge and then conduct contrast tests to identify the effects of the important variables while controlling the familywise error rate. (ii) We adopt the network-based statistics method to improve power by incorporating the graph topological structure. Both methods have wide applications for low signal-to-noise ratio data. We propose stability criteria for the choice of threshold in the network-based statistics procedure and utilize efficient massive parallel procedure to speed up the estimation and inference procedure. Results from our simulation studies show that the thresholds chosen by the proposed stability criteria outperform the Bonferroni threshold. To demonstrate applicability, we use both methods in the context of the Oxytocin and Aging Study to determine effects of age, gender, and drug treatment on resting-state functional connectivity, as well as in the context of the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange Study to determine effects of autism spectrum disorder on functional connectivity at rest.

Symptom scores were measured using the ADHD Rating Scale (ADHD-RS) IV [', '], for which scores can range from 0 to 27 for each symptom domain. Also for this data set we will restrict our analysis to the two symptom scores and gender.

Here we noticed, among other things, the causal link between inattention and hyperactivity/impulsivity. The analysis in this paper reveals that this causal link can also be found by restricting the analysis on the IMpACT data set to just three variables. To confirm this finding we considered the NeuroIMAGE and the ADHD-200 data sets. We did not have any other data sets available for the analysis that would satisfy the requirements mentioned in the introduction.', 'Fig A.

Despite ample evidence of atypical long-distance connectivity, the literature on local connectivity remains small and divergent. We used resting-state functional MRI regional homogeneity (ReHo) as a local connectivity measure in comparative analyses across several well-matched low-motion subsamples from the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange and in-house data, with a grand total of 147 ASD and 184 typically developing (TD) participants, ages 7–18\xa0years. We tested for group differences in each subsample, with additional focus on the difference between eyes-open and eyes-closed resting states. Despite selection of highest quality data and tight demographic and motion matching between groups and across samples, few effects in exactly identical loci (voxels) were found across samples. However, there was gross consistency across all eyes-open samples of local overconnectivity (ASD\xa0>\xa0TD) in posterior, visual regions. There was also gross consistency of local underconnectivity (ASD < TD) in cingulate gyrus, although exact loci varied between mid/posterior and anterior sections. While all eyes-open datasets showed the described gross similarities, the pattern of group differences for participants scanned with eyes closed was different, with local overconnectivity in ASD in posterior cingulate gyrus, but underconnectivity in some visual regions. Our findings suggest that fMRI local connectivity measures may be relatively susceptible to site and cohort variability and that some previous inconsistencies in the ASD ReHo literature may be reconciled by more careful consideration of eye status.']"

The core challenge remains the development of common paradigms for interrogating the myriad functional systems\n                              in the brain without the constraints of a priori hypotheses. Resting-state functional MRI (R-fMRI) constitutes a candidate\n                              approach capable of addressing this challenge. Imaging the brain during rest reveals large-amplitude spontaneous low-frequency\n                              (<0.1 Hz) fluctuations in the fMRI signal that are temporally correlated across functionally related areas. Referred to as\n                              functional connectivity, these correlations yield detailed maps of complex neural systems, collectively constituting an individual's\n                              “functional connectome.” Reproducibility across datasets and individuals suggests the functional connectome has a common architecture,\n                              yet each individual's functional connectome exhibits unique features, with stable, meaningful interindividual differences\n                              in connectivity patterns and strengths. Comprehensive mapping of the functional connectome, and its subsequent exploitation\n                              to discern genetic influences and brain–behavior relationships, will require multicenter collaborative datasets. Here we initiate\n                              this endeavor by gathering R-fMRI data from 1,414 volunteers collected independently at 35 international centers. We demonstrate\n                              a universal architecture of positive and negative functional connections, as well as consistent loci of inter-individual variability.\n                              Age and sex emerged as significant determinants. These results demonstrate that independent R-fMRI datasets can be aggregated\n                              and shared. High-throughput R-fMRI can provide quantitative phenotypes for molecular genetic studies and biomarkers of developmental\n                              and pathological processes in the brain. To initiate discovery science of brain function, the 1000 Functional Connectomes\n                              Project dataset is freely accessible at "", 'Accordingly, the 1000 Functional Connectomes Project was formed to aggregate existing R-fMRI data from collaborating centers\n                           throughout the world and to provide an initial demonstration of the ability to pool functional data across centers.

Financial support for the 1000 Functional\n                              Connectomes project was provided by grants from the National Institutes of Mental Health (R01MH083246 and R01MH081218 to F.X.C.\n                              and M.P.M.), National Institute on Drug Abuse (R03DA024775, to C.K.; R01DA016979, to F.X.C.), Autism Speaks, National Institute\n                              of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (R01NS049176, to B.B.), and the Howard Hughes Medical Institute (to J.S.A. and R.L.B.),\n                              as well as gifts to the NYU Child Study Center from the Stavros Niarchos Foundation, Leon Levy Foundation, Joseph P. Healy,\n                              Linda and Richard Schaps, and Jill and Bob Smith and an endowment provided by Phyllis Green and Randolph Cōwen.
