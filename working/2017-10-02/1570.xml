                <AbstractText>fMRI-based functional connectivity networks are often constructed by thresholding a correlation matrix of nodal time courses. In a typical thresholding approach known as hard thresholding, a single threshold is applied to the entire correlation matrix to identify edges representing super-threshold correlations. However, hard thresholding is known to produce a network with uneven allocation of edges, resulting in a fragmented network with a large number of disconnected nodes. It is suggested that an alternative network thresholding approach, node-wise thresholding, is able to overcome these problems. To examine this, various network characteristics were compared between networks constructed by hard thresholding and node-wise thresholding, with publicly available resting-state fMRI data from 123 healthy young subjects. It was found that networks constructed with hard thresholding included a large number of disconnected nodes, while such network fragmentation was not observed in networks formed with node-wise thresholding. Moreover, in hard thresholding networks, fragmentized modular organization was observed, characterized by a large number of small modules. On the other hand, such modular fragmentation was not observed in node-wise thresholding networks, producing modules that were robust at any threshold and highly consistent across subjects. These results indicate that node-wise thresholding may lead to less fragmented networks. Moreover, node-wise thresholding enables robust characterization of network properties without much influence by the selection of a threshold.</AbstractText>
