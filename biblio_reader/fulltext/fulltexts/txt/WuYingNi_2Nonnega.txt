In the multimodal neuroimaging framework, data on a single subject are collected from inherently different
sources such as functional MRI, structural MRI, behavioral and/or phenotypic information. The information
each source provides is not independent; a subset of features from each modality maps to one or more common
latent dimensions, which can be interpreted using generative models. These latent dimensions, or “topics,”
provide a sparse summary of the generative process behind thefeatures for each individual. Topic modeling, an
unsupervised generative model, has been used to map seemingly disparate features to a common domain. We
use Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) to infer the latent structure of multimodal ADHD data containing
fMRI, MRI, phenotypic and behavioral measurements. We compare four different NMF algorithms and ﬁnd that
the sparsest decomposition is also the most differentiating between ADHD and healthy patients. We identify dimensions that map to interpretable, recognizable dimensions such as motion, default mode network activity, and
other such features of the input data. For example, structural and functional graph theory features related to default mode subnetworks clustered with the ADHD inattentive diagnosis. Structural measurements of the default
mode network (DMN) regions such as the posterior cingulate, precuneus, and parahippocampal regions were all
related to the ADHD-Inattentive diagnosis. Ventral DMN subnetworks may have more functional connections in
ADHD-I, while dorsal DMN may have less. We also ﬁnd that ADHD topics may be dependent upon diagnostic site,
raising the possibility of the diagnostic differences across geographic locations. We assess our ﬁndings in light of
theADHD-200 classiﬁcation competition, and contrast our unsupervised, nominated topics with previously published supervised learning methods. Finally, we demonstrate the validity of these latent variables as biomarkers
by using them for classiﬁcation of ADHD in 730 patients. Cumulatively, this manuscript addresses how multimodal data in ADHD can be interpreted by latent dimensions.

In the NMF framework a matrix, V, is broken down into a product
using multiplicative updates, given by V ≈ WH (Lee et al., 1999). This
technique has been applied widely elsewhere to genetics (Devarajan,
2008; Kim and Park, 2007; Qi et al., 2009), document retrieval
(Molgaard et al., 2007), document clustering (Xu et al., 2003) and
image classiﬁcation (Guillamet et al., 2003; Liu and Zheng, 2004). We
apply it here to our multimodal data, including the demographic
variables in our model.
In this paper we use NMF to identify latent dimensions in multimodal data, ﬁnding “topics” across phenotypic, behavioral, structural and
functional MRI onto which all the multimodal data map. Each dimension would contain a subset of the original features, providing both a
sparse summary of a subject's information, as well as a mapping across
modalities. We apply this technique to the ADHD-200 dataset (Mennes
et al., 2012) containing MRI, fMRI, behavioral and phenotypic information from Attention Deﬁcit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) youth and
typically developing (TD) patients. We identify the latent dimensions
behind this multimodal dataset, and demonstrate how these latent
features additionally can be used for classiﬁcation of ADHD. Although
our results are speciﬁc to ADHD, the methods are applicable to multimodal data in general. These topics are directly interpretable, relating
to speciﬁc domains such as the default mode network (DMN) which
has been implicated previously in ADHD.
As opposed to supervised discriminative models where the features
predict a diagnosis (ADHD vs. healthy controls), we use an unsupervised generative model to map multimodal features to a common
space. We do not limit this mapping to exclusively imaging features,
but include in our latent variable model the behavioral and demographic
features. We hypothesize that topics which link the diagnosis to
imaging and phenotypic variables may nominate biomarkers related
speciﬁcally to the disease state, while topics not containing the diagnosis variable can still illuminate the relationship of features across
modalities.

Default mode network

The default mode network (DMN), represents a collection of distributed brain regions that oscillate coherently at low frequency during passive resting state when an individual is not focusing on external stimuli
(Raichle et al., 2001). The brain regions that comprise the DMN nodes
are intrinsically functionally correlated with one another (Biswal et al.,
1995), and are connected via direct and indirect anatomic projections
(Greicius et al., 2004). DMN low frequency oscillations are typically
attenuated during goal-oriented tasks, and activity strength in task

Structural MRI, functional MRI (fMRI), phenotypic and behavioral information all are examples of multimodal data that can be used to measure different aspects of a patient. A challenging problem in multimodal
imaging is the integration of EEG and fMRI data, both measures of neuronal activation. Finding a mapping between the observed and latent
feature spaces is not a trivial process. These features are on very different spatial and temporal domains, and are subject to different sources of
artifacts. Despite this, advances have been made in this mapping with
methods such as multiway partial least squares (Martınez-Montes
et al., 2004), ICA-based methods (Calhoun et al., 2009; Eichele et al.,
2009; Liu and Calhoun, 2007; Mantini et al., 2010), canonical correlation
analysis (Sui et al., 2011), and Bayesian-ICA hybrid approaches
(Lei et al., 2010).
When combining other data sources that are not measures of
neuronal activity, such as structural imaging, phenotypic information,
or behavioral data, this problem becomes even more difﬁcult. Although
these information sources are distinct in the general case, they likely all
share some common information. Because of this, investigating the latent dimensions of multimodal data allows observations from different
modalities to be linked together. When contrasting healthy and diseased patient groups,identifying the latent dimensions could suggest a
generative model of the disease itself.
Generative models such as Hidden Markov Models (Rabiner, 1989),
Restricted Boltzmann Machines (Smolensky, 1986), and Latent
Dirichlet Allocation (Blei et al., 2003) (LDA) can be used to infer the underlying joint probability distribution by which the observations are
generated. Non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) is a related technique that can be mapped directly to LDA when applying noninformative priors with maximum-likelihood estimation (Gaussier
and Goutte, 2005; Girolami and Kabán, 2003). NMF can also be viewed
as a positively-constrained version of independent component analysis
(ICA) (Højen-Sørensen et al., 2002; Hyvärinen and Oja, 2000).
NMF and ICA are both matrix decomposition methods; NMF is a
parts-based representation where the basis images, W, are constrained
to be positive, while ICA is a holistic decomposition that instead
constrains each basis to be statistically independent, thus permitting
negative basis values and encoding values. When applying these tools
to imaging data, the results are drastically different. For example, running ICA on images of faces produces ghostly-appearing faces for the
basis functions, while performing NMF on the same sets of images
would yield identiﬁable body parts, such as a pair of eyes or a mustache
(Lee et al., 1999).

ADHD-200 competition

220

Towards this aim, the ADHD 200 global ML competition (http://fcon_
1000.projects.nitrc.org/indi/adhd200/index.html) challenged the neuroimaging and data mining communities to develop a pattern classiﬁcation
method to predict ADHD diagnosis based on a combination of structural
MRI, resting state functional MRI (rs-fMRI), and demographic metrics. To
provide data for this competition, one of the largest multisite data consortiums was initiated to provide open access to data from nearly a thousand
children and adolescents with ADHD as well as age-matched controls.
This dataset has been much published on in a short time (Cheng et al.,
2012; Dai et al.; Mills et al., 2012; Olivetti et al.; Tomasi and Volkow,
2011, 2012), allowing a direct comparison of the methodology and the
common problems they all faced.
This competition was remarkable for many reasons, including the
large sample size for the training set (491 TD, 285 ADHD), the number
of contributing data centers (8), and the number of international teams
competing (21). Even more remarkable, however, were the results of
the competition. In general, it was much easier to classify TD than
ADHD, with high speciﬁcity and low sensitivity from all the teams. The
scoring system used within the competition was biased toward this, as
it gave more “points” for diagnosing correctly TD than ADHD-subtype.
However, even when equal weightings were used, diagnostic accuracy
was still much greater for TD children.

ADHD is a highly complex disorder marked behaviorally by problems with sustained attention and task prioritization. Its spectrum of
clinical features typically is expressed along the domains of persistent
inattention (ADHD-I), hyperactivity-impulsivity (ADHD-H) or a combination of both (ADHD-C) (American Psychiatric Association, 2000),
often affecting cognitive, emotional, and motor processes (Cortese,
2012). The clinical diagnosis in children is made after gathering information from parentand teacher surveys and ratings on ADHD-speciﬁc
behavioral rating scales. In order for the diagnostic criteria to be met,
the clinical features must be present in at least two settings and the
core symptoms must actually interfere with daily life at school, home,
and/or work (American Psychiatric Association, 2000).
Despite its high prevalence in children (∼5%) (Swanson et al., 1998),
the precise neural, genetic and cognitive underpinnings of ADHD remain unclear. While the heritability of ADHD also is well established, a
clear link between genes and the heterogeneous clinical features of
ADHD remains elusive, and it is likely that multiple neural pathways
and factors lead to the phenotypic expression of ADHD and its three
subtypes. It is possible that identiﬁcation of quantitative neuroimaging
biomarkers would improve detection and diagnosis, thus providing
the impetus for the machine learning (ML) contest. Further, an improved understanding of the interactions of both the neuroimaging
and other biomarkers may offer clues of the physiological basis of the
disease.

Surprisingly, the top placing team from University of Alberta
was disqualiﬁed on the grounds of not using any neuroimaging data
in a neuroimaging competition, predicting their results on the phenotypic variables alone (Brown et al., 2012).After testing various fMRI
measures (temporally-meaned fMRI Signal per voxel, voxel-projected
timecourses into PCA space, low-frequency voxel Fourier components,
voxel weightings on functional connectivity maps derived from ICA)
in competition with phenotypic information (site, age, gender, handedness, IQ measures) with multiple machine-learning algorithms (linear
SVM, cubic SVM, quadratic SVM, and Radial Basis Function(RBF)
SVM classiﬁers, the Alberta team selected a logistic classiﬁer that used
only the diagnostic information to classify on the test-set. This classiﬁer
obtained the highest prediction-accuracy within the competition of
62.5%.
Following the disqualiﬁcation, the ofﬁcial top-scoring team from
Johns Hopkins University predicted using a voting scheme across four
different algorithms (Eloyan et al., 2012). They used as features functional connectivity data from the motor cortex,as well as seed-voxel
correlation analysis. Structural features were not used. The most accurate of their four algorithms used a CUR matrix decomposition of the
functional scans (Mahoney and Drineas, 2009) along with gradient
boosting method, which they suspected of capturing the residual
motion that was not removed by the motion correction during preprocessing. Another of their algorithms used Latent Dirichlet Allocation to
identify subsets of imaging features which were then used for classiﬁcation. This team created in total four different algorithms which they
combined to vote on the diagnosis for each subject. The most accurate
algorithm in a hold-out set was used as the tie-breaking vote.
Our group from UCLA/Yale used structural, functional, and phenotypic information within each site to predict ADHD, yielding a 55% accuracy with 33% sensitivity and 80% speciﬁcity (Colby et al., 2012). We
generated nearly 200,000 neuroimaging features from each subject's
data—ranging from structural attributes such as cortical thickness, to
functional connectivity and graph theoretic measures. In this analysis
we ranked features, and found that caudate volume was one of the
highest-ranked structural features. We used SVM based recursive feature elimination (SVM-RFE) as a wrapper method based on the multiple
SVM-RFE (mSVM-RFE) extension described by (Duan et al., 2005),
which imposes a resampling layer on each recursion pass such that
the weights used for feature ranking/dropping are stabilized by averaging across results for multiple subsamples. We generated accuracy
curves that related the number of features and error using a 10 fold
cross validation approach. Features thattogether resulted in minimum
error were selected for our feature set. Further details can be found in
Colby et al., 2012. Diagnostic functional features included graph theoretic measures related to changes in default mode network (DMN) activity,
consistent with the hypothesis that ADHD subjects are impaired in their
ability to inhibit the DMN consistently for task execution (Fair et al.,
2010). Because of intra-site variability we selected features and trained
classiﬁers within each site, instead of pooling observations together
across sites.
In published studies of ADHD classiﬁcation using imaging data not
obtained from the ADHD-200 competition, the classiﬁcation accuracies
were an astonishing 85% (Zhu et al., 2005), which made the classiﬁcation results of theADHD-200 competition seem rather lackluster by
comparison. Brown et al. (Brown et al., 2012) posited that the ADHD200 competition had produced inferior results compared to other neuroimaging studies for three possible reasons. 1.) Most neuroimaging
classiﬁcation studies focused on Binary classiﬁcation, which is a computationally simpler task than trinary competition as in this study (TD,
ADHD-Combined, ADHD Inattentive). Because there is likely to be similarities between the two subtypes of ADHD, training a classiﬁer to distinguish among such subtle conditions is likely to result in higher error
rates than when distinguishing between a diseased population and
healthy controls. In addition, the scoring system used in ADHD-200
placed a higher priority on classifying TD children than ADHD, which

D

related brain regions (e.g. dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC)) tend
to be anticorrelated with DMN. Changes in the DMN have become hallmark indicators of pathogenesisin a number of conditions including
Alzheimer's disease (Greicius et al., 2004), depression (Sheline et al.,
2009), and autism spectrum disorder (for review see Buckner et al.,
2008).
Recently, a number of studies have demonstrated both structural and functional changes in the DMN associated with ADHD
(e.g. Yu-Feng et al., 2007). It has been speculated that ADHD individuals may have diminished ability to continuously sustain attention on a task due to interference by the DMN (Fassbender et al.,
2009; Sonuga-Barke and Castellanos, 2007). Fair et al. (2010) suggested that this may be due to different rates of maturation of the
DMN (Fair et al., 2010).

As opposed to supervised classiﬁcation algorithms where features
are used to discriminate between certain states (ADHD vs. healthy controls) and redundant features are effectively eliminated, generative
models of multimodal data map features to each other even when
they are unrelated to the diagnosis. These groupings are the latent dimensions onto which a subset of the multimodal features all map. This
is shown in Fig. 1. This is similar to saying that the observed features

While the task of optimal feature subset selection is difﬁcult for any
dataset, it becomes even more complex when classiﬁcation is performed on multimodal data, where the features themselves are represented in different subspaces and may vary in number over many
orders of magnitude. In particular, it is highly likely that a better selection of features could lead to improved methods for isolating and
excluding noise, which could have improved the overall predictive
capability of classiﬁers that used neuroimaging features in addition to
demographic data.

meant that the best “classiﬁer” might not have the greatest overall classiﬁcation accuracy. 2.) The ADHD-200 competition used a hold-out
dataset which was entirely independent and separate from the testing
set. Although in most publications 10-fold cross-validation is used to
separate the training and testing sets of data, these usually are not
kept in a lock-boxÓ during the model selection procedure. Models can
stillbe trained, features can be selected, and parameters can be optimized across the cross-validation error, leading to the testing set
being biased (Kerr et al., submitted for publication). This means that a
true, Òlock-boxÓ validation set is likely to produce lower classiﬁcation
accuracy than a Òhold-outÓ set from a cross-validation set that likely
has played a role in the model selection and training. 3.) The ADHD200 dataset was likely much more difﬁcult to classify upon because of
the heterogeneity and large sample size. For example, there were 8
sites used for the classiﬁcation training and testing, each with different
scanners used to acquire the data. In addition, two sites contributed only
healthy controls and one site did not submit any training data(Brown),
which undoubtedly affected the way the algorithms treated Site during
classiﬁcation.

Fig. 1. Topic Modeling of Multimodal Features in ADHD: a conceptual illustration. The structural MRI, functional MRI, and phenotypic observations are all generated by latent topics, which
in turn generate each subject's multimodal dataset. By learning the topics, we get a mapping across multimodal features and a generative model behind the observed data. The data matrix
V has n feature rows and m observation columns. If V contained a collection of multimodal features (total features by patients), then NMF would decompose the data into a set of “basis
images” and encodings, such that Viμ ≈ (WH)iμ = ∑Kk = 1 WikHkμ where the W matrix contains the basis set of multimodal features (topics) and is of dimension n × k, and the “encoding
matrix” H is of dimensions k × m, for row i and column μ.

We limited this study to the original training dataset, to allow direct
comparison to the published studies. This left 7 total Sites. We use 748
subjects, of whom 472 had been diagnosed as healthy controls. The subjects ranged in age from 7.1 years of age to 21.8 years, with a mean age
of 12.4 years. The full demographic summary tables within Site are
shown in Table 1. The diagnosis rate of ADHD varied across the 7 sites,
of which 2 had only healthy controls. The diagnostic subtypes for
ADHD and the medication status for the patients are shown in Table 2.
The IQ information within each site is shown in Table 3. The ADHD information is shown in Table 4. Finally, we break down the demographic
and behavioral information within diagnosis in Tables 6 and 7, which

We used fMRI data that was preprocessed and made publicly available by the Neurobureau using tools from FSL (http://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.

of the preprocessing pipleline are available at http://www.nitrc.org/

data were slice time corrected (AFNI 3dTshift), motion corrected
(AFNI 3dvolreg), registered to MNI-152 space with 4mm3 resolution
(FSL FLIRT), denoised to statistically control for nuisance signals from
the ventricles and white matter (AFNI 3dDeconvolve), and bandpass
temporal ﬁltered between .008 and .09Hz (AFNI 3dFourier). For the
functional data, we used the 12-dimensional motion parameters, the
number of independent components intrinsically estimated for each
subject by FSL Melodic, and a measure of functional connectivity
based upon pairwise regional timeseries correlation of 90 regions of interest deﬁned by Grecius and colleagues (Shirer et al., 2012). We

derived 90 × 90 functional connectivity matrices and analyzed them
with the Brain Connectivity Toolbox (https://sites.google.com/site/
bctnet/), calculating four graph theory properties for each node:
positive/negative strengthand the positive/negative participation coefﬁcient (Rubinov and Sporns, 2011).
For the structural analysis Freesurfer (Fischl, 2012) was used to
parcellate and segment each subject's T1 MP-RAGE anatomical scan
into 68 cortical regions (34 per hemisphere, based on the Desikan–
Killiany atlas) and 40 subcortical regions. For each of the cortical
regions, the curvature index, folding index, Gaussian curvature, gray
matter volume, mean curvature, surface area, thickness average, and
thickness standard deviation were used to describe the behavior and
form of each region. For each of the subcortical regions, we characterized the volume, normalized mean intensity, and the normalized
standard deviation of the intensity.
The phenotypic data contained: the diagnosis (TD, ADHDCombined, ADHD-Hyperactive/Impulsive, ADHD-Impulsive), handedness (left/right/ambidextrous), gender, IQ scores and Instrument used
to assess intelligence, ADHD Behavioral measures and the instrument,
and the patients' medication status. All categorical observations were
coded as factors. For example, each site variable was coded as a binary
variable where ‘1’ indicated a member of that site, and ‘0’ otherwise.
Subjects with more than 12 missing structural measurements were excluded from the analysis. We variance-normalized all variables and removed those variables with excessive missing values. All remaining
missing values were imputed using median imputation. This left 730
total patients with 1068 total features, detailed in Table 5.

from all modalities are all created by common set of latent topics, where
each topic is a subset of features from across modalities. In comparison,
discriminative algorithms identify and combine the strongest information sources to predict a single outcome. Because their primary
objective is to map features to a diagnosis, they are mute on the
relationship of features to each other when the features themselves
are unrelated to the disease.
Using the ADHD-200 competition dataset, we present our results
from unsupervised topic-modeling and discuss how they relate to
previously-published supervised classiﬁcation models. Although this
application uses a generative model, we validate this construct by
using latent features within a discriminative model to predict ADHD. If
these topics were merely random subjective constructs, using them to
summarize the raw multimodal observations would prove futile to
“diagnose” ADHD. If, however, they were meaningful constructs, then
patients' latent feature scores would be a sparse summary of all observed multimodal features, which could then be used for classiﬁcation.
This would be analogous to the feature selection or dimension reductions step undertaken in most machine learning models.

We applied the Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (Lee et al., 1999)
(NMF) algorithm to this dataset instead of more commonly used
methods such as ICA, because the NMF constraints yield qualitatively
different, and arguably more meaningful, dimensions of the data. As
its name suggests, NMF requires all values in the decomposition to
be exclusively positive. This is similar to imposing a sparsity constraint on both the encodings and basis “images”; because the superposition of basis images must be linear, and because no values are
allowed to be negative, many values are shrunk towards zero. This
sparsity offers an additional interpretative beneﬁt since, as there
are no “negative” loadings. For categorical features where someone is
either female or not (but not negatively female), this positive encoding
offers a more intuitive explanation of the underlying structure being
evaluated.
Furthermore, ICA is usually applied as a within-modality means of
dimension reduction. For example, ICA is frequently applied either
across a group of fMRI scans or within a single scan to extract plausible
networks, which themselves form a within-modality basis set. These
networks can be used to obtain estimates of functional connectivity.
Instead of applying NMF within modality, we are applying it across modality where we provide normalized features and let the algorithm
nominate a multimodal basis set.
The data matrix V has n feature rows and m observation columns. If

We implemented NMF using the statistical programming environment R (R Development Core Team, 2012) using the package NMFN
(Liu, 2012), and by a separate implementation within Matlab (Lin,
2007). Because our goal was to maximize the sparsity of the latent
features, we compared four different NMF algorithms and ultimately
selected the algorithm providing the sparsest basis set. This was equivalent to selecting the NMF algorithm that produced the maximal
amount of null (zero) values in the basis set. We compared the decompositions of four different NMF algorithms: NMF can be formulated as a
minimization problem with linear constraints, which can be solved by
alternating least squares (ALS), multinomial, multiplicative-update.

These represent differentfunctions measuring the distance between V
and WH. We additionally implemented the projected-gradient to solve
the alternating non-negative least squares problems to obtain NMF;
this has faster convergence and stronger optimization properties than
the multiplicative update approach. We implemented NMF by projected
gradient using the Matlab code in (Lin, 2007).
We selected our ﬁnal algorithm based upon the sparsity of the
encodings within the 20 estimated basis images. This is similar to making
the assumption that only a subset of the entire set of multimodal features
will be related to each other: by looking at each basis vector, we can
effectively zero-out the features with weights that are close to zero,
and interpret the rest as contributing to a given topic. This is shown in
Fig. 2. Based upon this, without knowledge of the actual features, we selected the ALS results for further analysis. We thresholded basis images,
where each “dimension” corresponded to a multimodal feature, at the
25th percentile. This threshold was selected to eliminate all nullweight features of the W matrix, and left roughly 263 features (n) per
topic k ∈ K.
We additionally tested how each algorithms' encoding matrix
differed between ADHD and TD patients using a 2-sample t-test on
the associated encoding variable for each topic. This is answering the
question of whether any topics were more likely to be expressed in
the patients than the controls, and vise versa. This also was done to assess whether a sparse feature set was truly a more efﬁcient representation of the disease. All algorithms gave encoding values with more than
chance difference between patients and controls, but the selected ALS
algorithm, which was the sparsest, also had the maximal differentiation
between ADHD and TD patients with 9 of the Topics showing statistically signiﬁcant (uncorrected) encoding levels between groups.

where the W matrix contains the basis set of multimodal features and is
of dimension n × K, and the “encoding matrix” H is of dimensions
K × m, for row i and column μ.
The topics are the individual basis images, which have been
thresholded to remove those features with weightings ≈ 0. Because
NMF indirectly encourages sparsity by its positive constraints, roughly
75% of all weights within the basis images are nearly null. This allows
a clear distinction between multimodal features that contribute to a
topic and features that drop out.

We next validated the latent features by rerunning NMF on a
dataset that had been stripped of all diagnostic information and
ADHD scale scores, leaving behind only the functional, structural, demographic, and IQ testing information. We set the number of topics
to 20 according to (Smith et al., 2009), although this is a parameter
which could be investigated in future work. After running NMF
with 20 dimensions, we extracted the encoding matrix, H, of dimension
(20 × 730), ornumberofbasisvaluesbysubjects. Each of the 20 values per
subject represent the subject's score within that latent dimension.
These were used as features to predict diagnosis (ADHD vs. TD).
Using leave-one-out cross-validation, we used Weka (Hall et al.,
2009) to train a C4.5 decision tree using data from all but one patient
to diagnose the left-out patient (Quinlan, 1993). The identity of the
validation patient was then permuted sothat each patient was the validation patient once and only once. At each node, the tree was trained to
split the training data into two daughter populations based on a threshold value for one of the 20 encoding bases vectors, such that the
Kullbeck–Leibler divergence, or information gain, between the two

P

499

daughter populations was maximized. The tree was pruned such that
this information gain and number of training instances per daughter
population was greater than 0.25 and 2, respectively. Due to the fact
that only one of 730 patients was left out in each of the 730 trees trained
on each training set, we expect this to closely resemble the actual
decision tree used for each validation case.
The topics learned from the data not containing diagnostic information are subtly different than those learned on the full dataset. To illustrate the learned decision tree with respect to the topics discussed in
this paper, we create a mappingfrom the “unbiased” features (learned
without diagnostic information), to the biased features (learned with
biased information) using the correlation of the basis vectors. This is
shown in Fig. 7. Between the “biased” dataset and the “unbiased”
dataset, the mapping across topics learned was fairly consistent with a
correlation of roughly 90% between pairs of Topics from each dataset's
NMF. This was established by using the encoding matrix, and identifying topics from the different analyses which had highly correlated
encoding values across patients. This shows a consistency of the NMF
algorithm itself, where Topics across slightly changed datasets can be
matched up.

Among the 20 topics, 9 had statistically signiﬁcant differences between ADHD and TD patients within the encoding values (uncorrected
p-values) as shown in Fig. 2. This signiﬁcance was established across
all Sites, even though some topics were site-speciﬁc; many topics
contained “Site Y” variables indicating that being a member of that site
was associated with that particular topic. If we had performed testing
only within the sites identiﬁed within the topics, we likely would have
seen more signiﬁcant tests but, as this was not the primary objective of
the paper, we didn't pursue this testing further. We use this Site-wide signiﬁcance level to help us identify topics that may be associated uniquely
with the disease, but also interpret non-signiﬁcant topics as well. The
full list of topics is available at http://ariana82.bol.ucla.edu/downloads2/ﬁles/ALSNMFTopics.xlsx as well as a supplement to this article, showing
the decomposition with NMF using ALS. We show 3 partial topics in Fig. 3.

In the context of the current work, we found a number of structural,
functional connectivity, and graph theoretic metrics occurring with
ADHD test score that are consistent with the DMN in Topic 12. Morphologic metrics related to the rostral ACC, forexample, clustered with ADHD
index score and ADHD-I, perhaps related to decreased anticorrelation between posterior DMN nodes and rostral ACC that has been noted in both
ADHD adults (Castellanos et al., 2008) and children (Sun et al., 2012).
ADHD score also clustered with changes in caudate and putamen
volume. Recent meta-analyses of structural differences have reported
decreased volume in basal ganglia regions including the caudate,
putamen, and globus pallidus (Ellison-Wright et al., 2008), possibly related to observations that ADHD subjects have altered levels of dopamine
(DA) transporter densities in striatal regions (McGough, 2012).

subcortical features identiﬁed, indicating that cortical measurements
may be more susceptible to motion than subcortical. Topic 10 was statistically different between patients and controls, and did not have any
Site markers. The encoding values for each topic indicate how strongly
that topic is implicated in that subject; the ADHD patients had higher
encoding values than the TD patients, indicating that ADHD patients
were more likely to contain motion-related features from this topic
(p-value = 1.0 e − 04). Topic 14 was not signiﬁcant between patient
groups, yet included the Site variables 1,3, and 7,indicating that this
was a unique pattern found in those locations. For both of these features,
the number of ICs from the fMRI analysis was a selected feature.

When we normalized by the number of features in each modality, we

coefﬁcient also clustered in Topic 12 with ADHD-I. While this may be
some form of compensation mechanism, the reason for this remains unclear. Positive strength inventral DMN nodes, including the retrosplenial
cortex and medial temporal lobe were also part of this cluster. In
interpreting this topic, it appears as though ventral DMN subnetworks
may have more connections in ADHD-I, while dorsal DMN may have
less. Overall, this may be related to the fact that the latency of recovery
of the DMN appears different across the DMN subnetworks (Van De
Ville et al., 2012). Fair et al. (2010) also applied graph measures to
DMN data in ADHD adolescents and found thatDMN was a more strongly
connected network in TD patients, though these results were below the
threshold of signiﬁcance (Fair et al., 2010).

Conclusion

674

We see several factors which may have contributed to the dismal
classiﬁcation accuracy of this ADHD-200 dataset relative to other studies.
For this dataset, the demographics within each subpopulation were different, with OHSU females having substantially higher IQs than the rest
of the population. Because many prior studies were on small samples
with a median of 39 participants obtained from a single site, the samples
were likely homogenous and thus easier to discriminate amongst. The
classiﬁcationaccuracy accuracy was maximized when training each

Using latent features as variables for classiﬁcation proved to be a
valid means of dimension-reduction prior to classiﬁcation. The observed
cross-validation accuracy within this (training) dataset is comparable to
the testing accuracy in the ADHD-200competition using individual neuroimaging features, but is still less than the accuracy of classiﬁers that
used only the demographic information. Our objective in identifying
topics was to map multimodal features to each other; their ability to
map observational data to a diagnosis is a fringe beneﬁt, and indicates
the ﬂexibility of generative models.
The tree split ﬁrst on Topic 15, which was also the Topic with the most
different p-values between ADHD and TD (p b 4e − 16). This Topic
contained the variable Site 7, which contained only TD patients. It also
contained several IQ measures. The secondsplit, Topic 1, contained only
IQ-related phenotypic features, and was signiﬁcant between patients
and controls (p b 2.5e − 07). The third topic, Topic 10, contained many
motion parameters and was statistically different between patients and
controls.

to DMN nodes were present in the topic including posterior cingulate,
precuneus, and parahippocampal regions. Increasing evidence and
meta-analysis suggests that the DMN actually consists of a series of subnetworks that communicate and coactivate through overlapping nodes
(Laird et al., 2009). For example, the medial temporal lobe is thought to
provide episodic memory associations that are used while generating
self-referential thought patterns. Although the exact number of subsystems is still debated, the pCC and precuneus are thought to be key DMN
integration nodes. This clustering is interesting given that an overall decreased network homogeneity, particularly with respect to precuneus
functional connectivity, has been reported in resting state data from
ADHD children (Uddin et al., 2008).
Nearly half the features in this topic were related to graph theoretic
metrics. Negative strength in the dorsal DMN nodes including pCC and
medial PFC and negative strength (number of connections) related to
the precuneus network clustered with ADHD-I. Despite the low
strength related to the precuneus network, a high participation

The identiﬁcation of motion artifacts and the presence of higher motion topics in ADHD was an expected ﬁnding given the known relationship between ADHD and motion. In a study using infrared motion
analysis, boys with ADHD were found to have 2.3times greater head
motion than healthy boys (Teicher et al., 1996). Motion is a known contaminant in fMRI and MRI (Friston et al., 1996), and many methods exist
to mitigate this artifact (Oakes et al., 2005). Motion correction algorithms in fMRI may, however, induce artifacts of their own when high
levels of motion aren't present (Freire and Mangin, 2001). This could
be problematic in studies where one patient group is expected to
move more than others. Uncorrected data would naturally have higher
levels of noise in the ADHD group, while motion-corrected data may
have artifacts introduced in the TD group. The motion topics also contain both contain as a feature the NumberofICs. This is consistent with
the ﬁnding that ICA can frequently identify and nominate motion artifacts, and has been used as a method of motion artifact correction
(De Martino et al., 2007). Finally, the high presence of motion artifacts
in two topics echoes the earlier ﬁndings of (Eloyan et al., 2012) who
found that motion parameters were quite powerful for classiﬁcation of
ADHD in their winning algorithm.

disentangle the disease from the medication status. Finally, our hypothesis of sparsity producing better topics was never fully tested,
but could be in future work by seeing how the sparsity of topics affected the classiﬁcation accuracy of ADHD. Future research is needed
in more homogeneous samples with respect to medication status,
disease, behavioral measures as well as with more extensive behavioral and demographic measures to explore the utility of this model
in classifying subjects.
This analysis began initially with modeling the features using traditional topic modeling, or Latent Dirichlet Allocation. This model
produced null results, where neither Site nor ADHD Diagnosis were
identiﬁed within any of the topics. We believe this ﬁnding to be an artifact of the model used possibly relating to the priors; since LDA learned
the entire distribution uniformly even though the data originated from
different Sites, it was unable to perceive hierarchical structures where
the diagnosis of ADHD was contingent upon Site. Because of this, the
model failed to identify site-speciﬁc effects such as diagnosis. It is possible that extensions of LDA such as Author-Topic modeling would be
able to correct for the diagnostic and patient inhomogeneity.
We believe that generative models offer a strong alternative to
discriminative models in the analysis of multimodal data. Because generative models do not focus exclusively on a single feature or diagnosis,
they are able to propose a more complete picture of how the modalities
relate to each other. This framework allows an unconstrained mapping
across features. Although we have investigated only two models for this
dataset (LDA and NMF), both methods proposed plausible latent
dimensions with the DMN topics present in both. Because of this, we expect future work on generative models to prove a promising approach
for analysis of multimodal data.

model within site, and that even pooling the data and adjusting for Site
did not outperform training within each Site alone.
Pittsburg/Site 7, and Washington University/Site 8, contributed only
normal controls. Site 8 loaded on Topics 3 and 18; for neither of these
topics did the model distinguish between ADHD and control subjects.
Interestingly, Site 4 (NeuroImage) is implicated in these same topics
and Site 5 (NYU) in Topic 3 and Site 6 (OHSU) in Topic 18. Site 4
(NeuroImage) subjects were substantially older than the subjects in
other sites as the mean age was almost 17 years. Sites 5 and 6 had the
highest proportion of Inattentive subtype patients. As people with
ADHD age, hyperactive symptoms become more internalized and inattention becomes the more dominant expression of the disorder. Note
that of all topics where the Inattentive subtype was included, Topics 5,
7, 12, and 17, Site 6 was also included. As Topic 12 distinguished between ADHD and control subjects and included loadings for the Inattention scale and Site 5 and Site 6, this topic might be of special interest in
characterizing subjects with primarily inattentive subtype of ADHD.
According to Cortese (Cortese et al., 2012), patterns of FMRI activation
differ between adults and children. Therefore, it may be advantageous
to repeat the analysis in future work with this dataset only among
younger participants who are not of inattentive subtype.
This frequent nomination of Site within NMF-derived topics raises
important questions about diagnostic homogeneity and the possibility
that either ADHD is not a distinct diagnosisf. There may be different diagnostic practices within each site. For example, in the Beijing site, females
with low IQs were exclusively diagnosed with ADHD. This may indicate a
subjectivity in the diagnosis, where two identically matched people may
receive a different diagnosis depending on where they are evaluated.
There are certain limitations to this work; we set the number of
topics based on previous imaging work (Smith et al., 2009), but did
not investigate this parameter. We selected our NMF algorithm
based upon our hypothesis that sparsity in the basis set would improve classiﬁcation accuracy. Although we demonstrated that sparsity did coincide with the ability to separate patients and controls
in a t-test, a set of thorough machine learning models was never constructed to validate this hypothesis. Although we had information on
who was being medicated for most Sites, there was no information
on dosages, speciﬁc medications, and compliance. This necessarily
implies that topics on an unmedicated group, or on a homogeneously
medicated group, could be quite different, as it is impossible to
