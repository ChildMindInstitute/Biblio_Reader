Introduction

Tetsuya IIDAKA, M.D., Ph.D.

Results

 Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is
characterized by impaired
development of social interaction and
communication skills and a restricted
repertoire of activities and interests.
Although the neural and genetic
underpinnings of ASD have been
extensively investigated, the etiology
of the disorder has remained elusive,
and clinical diagnosis continues to rely
on symptom‐based criteria
criteria.
Functional magnetic resonance
imaging (fMRI) of the brain is a
powerful tool for exploring
biomarkers of psychiatric and
developmental disorders. In the
present study, resting state (rs‐) fMRI
and a neural network algorithm were
used to classify a large sample of
patients with ASD and control
subjects

 Both increased and decreased
connectivities between the regions
contributed to high classification
accuracy. (Fig. 3)
 Several confounding factors (e.g.,
site, sex, age, IQ, and medication) did
not significantly affect the results. (Fig.

 False negative (FN) group was
characterized by higher IQ and equal
level of autistic symptoms as
compared with true positive (TP)
group. (Fig. 5)

Methods
 The subject's brain activity was
measured during resting condition by
using 3 Tesla MRI scanner for
approximately six minutes. (Fig. 1)
 Correlation matrices of 90 distinct
regions computed from rs‐fMRI time‐
series data were entered into a
p
(
) for
probabilistic neural network (PNN)
classification. (Fig. 2)
 A leave‐one‐out cross‐validation
procedure was used to compute the
sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy.
 The effects of several confounding
factors on accuracy data were
investigated.
 Finally, the participants with ASD
who were classified as CTL were

Limitations
 Detailed characteristics of the
subjects were not available in the
d b
database.
 The same brain template was used
to normalize the image for every
subject, despite the wide range of
subjects’ ages.
 Confounding factors such as motion
artifacts, the differences in imaging
and experimental protocols could not
be controlled in the analysis.
 The classification results might be
attributable to differences in subjects’
head motion, attention, anxiety,
thought content, or other
physiological factors during scanning.

Accuracy (%)

 Rs‐fMRI data from subjects with
ASD and typical development (CTL)
was downloaded from the multi‐
center research project database in
U.S. (Autism Brain Image Data
Exchange, ABIDE, http:// fcon_1000.

ml, Table 1)
 ABIDE provides rs‐fMRI datasets of
ASD and typical controls for the
purpose of data sharing in the
scientific community. In accordance
with guidelines and protocols, all
datasets are anonymous, with no
protected health information
included.
 The data used in the present study
were obtained from 12 institutes (see
Notes).
 The diagnosis of ASD was made by
using ADI‐R and ADOS in all institutes
except one.
 In the present study, only subjects
under 20 years of age were used as
participants. (6‐19 years old)

 The present study suggests that an
intrinsic connectivity matrix computed
from rs‐fMRI data may yield a possible
biomarker of ASD.
 These results also support the view
that altered network connectivity
within the brain contributes to the
neurobiological underpinnings of this
disorder.
 However, further investigation to
remove several confounding factors is
needed.
