Abstract
Objective. Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) have been associated with atypical cortical grey and
subcortical white matter development. Neurodevelopmental theories postulate that a relation between

cortical maturation and structural brain connectivity may exist. We therefore investigated the development
of gyrification and white matter connectivity and their relationship in individuals with ASD and their
typically developing peers.

Method. T1- and diffusion-weighted images were acquired from a representative sample of 30 children

and adolescents with ASD (aged 8 to 18 years), and 29 typically developing children matched for age,
sex, hand preference, and socioeconomic status. The FreeSurfer suite was used to calculate cortical

probabilistic tractography and tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS).

Results. Left prefrontal and parietal cortex showed a relative, age-dependent decrease in gyrification
index in children and adolescents with ASD compared to typically developing controls. This result was
replicated in an age and IQ-matched sample provided by the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange
(ABIDE) initiative. Furthermore, tractography and TBSS showed a complementary pattern, where left

Introduction
Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are pervasive developmental disorders characterized
by persistent deficits in social communication and social interaction and the presence of

RI
PT

restricted, repetitive patterns of behavior, interests, or activities 1. The early onset of symptoms,
typically well before the age of three, has been suggested to coincide with an overgrowth of
cortical volume during the first years of life followed by a gradual decrease

2,3

. This pattern

SC

appears not to be limited to specific brain areas, but to involve the entire cortex 4,5. Post mortem
research of childhood ASD has shown an excess of neurons and disorganization in all cortical
laminae of the prefrontal cortex (PFC), suggesting that increases in brain size have an early

AN
U

onset, possibly during prenatal neurodevelopment 6,7.

The brain’s folding pattern is a strong marker of prenatal neurodevelopment

8

.

Gyrification commences in gestational week 16 and greatly intensifies during the third trimester
when the brain folds in on itself, as cortical volume—mostly white matter (WM)—and surface

TE
D

area (SA) rapidly increase 9. To date, multiple theories have tried to explain the pattern of
cortical folding. Tension-induced folding suggests that strongly interconnected regions pull
towards each other and lead to the formation of gyri, whereas more sparsely connected fibers
10

. The “grey matter hypothesis” suggests that gyrification may

be the result of cell proliferation in the outer subventricular zone during early gestation 11. This

hypothesis is based on findings in transgenic mice, which showed increased cerebral cortical
SA and human-like folds after controlling the cell cycle exit of neural precursors in the outer
subventricular zone 12.

Whole-brain studies have indeed shown a pattern of increased sulcal complexity

However, considerable heterogeneity in symptom presentation and severity and the

the relationship between gyrification and connectivity to date. In the current study, we set out to

age-related changes in a sample of children and adolescents with ASD. We specifically aimed
at investigating the PFC given previous literature. We hypothesized that GI would be reduced in

children and adolescents with ASD. Furthermore, we used an independent sample of highfunctioning children and adolescents with ASD from the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange
(ABIDE) initiative to replicate our findings

Participants

RI

Thirty children and adolescents aged 8 to 18 years with ASD, as well as 29 typically developing
controls, were recruited, matched for age, sex, hand preference, and socio-economic status
(Table 1). Children and adolescents with ASD were recruited through family associations and
the outpatient clinic of the Child and Adolescent Psychiatry Department at Hospital General

Typically developing controls were recruited from the community at publicly funded schools with
characteristics similar to those attended by participants with ASD and in the same geographic
area 25.

Children and adolescents with ASD were included if they fulfilled DSM-IV-TR criteria for
pervasive developmental disorders at the time of assessment

26

and the Gillberg criteria

experience in the field of ASD conducted all diagnostic assessments. Detailed information on
the diagnostic assessments is given in Supplement 1 (available online).

tests of the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (WISC-R31) for participants less than 16
years of age, or the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS-III:

32

years or older. For the group with ASD, full-scale IQ was obtained using the WISC-R or WAIS-III
33

. As lower IQ may be considered typical of the ASD

depending on the age of the participant

phenotype, IQ was not entered as a covariate in any of the designs to prevent partialling out
variance that is potentially relevant to the disorder 34. Hand preference was assessed using item

For each lobe and the forceps minor, we used analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) to

explored if it was accompanied by a significant diagnosis x age interaction. Medication status
did not show any significant effects and was thus not used as a covariate in the final analyses.

EP

TBSS voxelwise analyses for FA, AD, and RD were carried out across participants for
each point of the common skeleton. We applied the same ANCOVA model as described above

at each voxel of the skeleton. A permutation-based approach was performed to control for the
family-wise error (FWE;

46

permutations set at 5000 in FSL’s Randomise (FMRIB Software Library Randomise v2.9).
The relationship between GI and connectivity was assessed using ANCOVA on the

standardized residuals (corrected for age) of GI and the connectivity measures. Effect sizes are

There was an interactive effect of diagnosis x age on left prefrontal and parietal GI,
where participants with ASD show a relative decrease with age as compared to typically
developing controls (Figure 1 and Figures S2-S5, available online). These results remained

significant when two female participants were removed from the analyses. There was no main
effect of diagnosis in the absence of a diagnosis x age interaction. Finally, there were no effects

of whole-brain GI and SA (Table S1, available online) and SA per lobe (Figures S2-S5, available

GI and SA: Replication in an Age and IQ-Matched Independent Sample
As Figure 1 shows, the significant diagnosis x age interactions for the left prefrontal and

parietal cortex GI were replicated in the ABIDE set. For SA there was no significant diagnosis x
age interaction (left prefrontal: F=0.75, p=.39, d=0.17, left parietal: F=2.89, p=.09, d=0.34), nor a
main effect of diagnosis alone (left prefrontal: F=0.43, p=.52, d=0.13, left parietal: F=2.28,

EP

p=.13, d=0.30).

Furthermore, as the replication sample was not fully matched on verbal IQ (VIQ: Table

AC
C

2), the analyses were repeated in a slightly smaller but VIQ-matched subsample of 39 children
with ASD and 56 typically developing children (Table S6, available online). In this subsample,
the effect of the diagnosis x age interaction held for left prefrontal (F=3.83, p=.05, d=0.41), and
parietal (F=4.59, p=.04, d=0.45) GI remained significant.
As the participants from the replication sample included more females than the Madrid
sample (Table 2), we assessed whether the interaction was still significant after controlling for
sex and found left prefrontal GI is significant at the trend level (F=3.66, p=.059), and the left
parietal GI remains significant (F=5.47, p=.02).

(F=6.40, p=.01, d=0.68), diagnosis (F=7.58, p=.01, d=0.74), and diagnosis x age (F=10.12,
p<.01, d=0.86) on RD (Figure 2). There were no effects for AD. These findings were confirmed

in the TBSS analyses (Figure 2), where we found a diagnosis x age interaction on FA and RD,
but not on AD, within the same region (Montreal Neurological Institute [MNI] coordinates [mm] of

The Relationship Between Forceps Minor Diffusion and Left Prefrontal Gyrification
To assess the age-independent relation between prefrontal GI and forceps minor FA and

RD in the Madrid sample, we first linearly regressed out the effect of age on the left prefrontal

indeed showed RD and GI were significantly correlated in the group with ASD (r = -.50, p = .01),

Discussion
The current study shows age-related differences in gyrification in the left prefrontal and
parietal cortex in a representative sample of children and adolescents with ASD, while there

RI
PT

were no differences in cortical SA within the age range studied. These results were replicated in
a larger age- and IQ-matched independent sample including high-functioning individuals with
ASD from the ABIDE initiative 23. Furthermore, age-related differences were observed in anterior

SC

callosal forceps minor connectivity. These results suggest abnormalities in two major
morphometric domains, which in addition seem negatively related in ASD.

M
AN
U

The reported age-related differences in left prefrontal and parietal gyrification in ASD
may reflect abnormal cortical maturation during childhood and adolescence. It has been
suggested that in typically developing individuals, gyrification peaks during or even before
toddlerhood

47,48

followed by a decrease in adolescence and adulthood

49,50

. Our results show

that compared to typically developing children, this relative developmental decrease in

TE
D

gyrification may be more pronounced in individuals with ASD, and that it may follow a similar
pattern as the possible progressive decrease in total brain volume that has been suggested in
ASD 4.

EP

The age-related decrease of gyrification in children and adolescents with ASD converges
with earlier findings in studies with similar age ranges

17,18,51

. This suggests that differences in

AC
C

methodologies or group characteristics may indeed have contributed to inconsistencies with
previous studies. However, the abnormal pattern of left prefrontal and parietal gyrification was
observed both in low- and higher-functioning children and adolescents with ASD, indicating that
on the regional level, gyrification is likely to be affected across different levels of IQ in individuals
with ASD.

Interestingly, there was no interaction between group and age for cortical SA. Given the
strong relationship between SA and cortical volume 52, this may imply that within this age range,

10

ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT

cortical morphological complexity rather than brain size is more defining in the pathophysiology
of ASD. This notion fits with recently reported differences in cortical shape complexity in ASD
without differences in cortical SA 17,53.

The forceps minor connects the medial and lateral parts of the PFC. In contrast with
inconsistent findings of reduced gyrification in ASD, reduced interhemispheric connectivity—and
specifically decreased forceps minor connectivity—has been reported consistently (for reviews

Individuals with CA experience autism-like symptoms such as impairments in social interaction

Finally, left prefrontal gyrification and forceps minor connectivity showed a negative, age-

EP

independent relation, suggesting a stable relationship between prefrontal gyrification and
forceps minor radial diffusivity across childhood and adolescence in ASD. This relationship may

AC
C

reflect atypical neurodevelopmental processes that arise before childhood. Speculatively, at a
young age, left prefrontal and parietal gyrification may even be increased in ASD. Such a
relation could be hypothesized to be tied to the heightened presence of short-range intracortical
white matter connections

10,53

: Increased left prefrontal and parietal gyrification during early

brain development may then reflect local overgrowth of short-range connectivity at the expense
of decreased long-range (forceps minor) connectivity

18,53,61

. This converges with the present

understanding of ASD as a “disconnection syndrome,”62 where connections, especially within or
between the prefrontal cortices, are compromised

21

. When comparing the results from

11

ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT

tractography and TBSS, the group difference in FA appears to be driven primarily by a
difference in RD. A change in RD, independent of axial diffusion, could indeed suggest
myelination loss, or loss of axons in the forceps minor 63.

RI
PT

Strengths of this study lie in the multimodal approach allowing for the microstructural and
macrostructural neuroanatomical characterization of the disorder, and in the replication of the
gyrification results in a larger, independent, yet similar sample of individuals. There are,

SC

however, also limitations that need to be taken into consideration. In the Madrid sample, no
measure of full-scale IQ was available for typically developing participants. Previous studies
have shown that in typically developing individuals, the two subtests we used provide a reliable

M
AN
U

estimate of IQ 33. Furthermore, even though IQ was not matched in the Madrid sample, parental
education and SES (often used as an estimate of premorbid IQ in studies of other psychiatric
disorders) did not differ significantly between the two groups. The similarity of the results in the
IQ-matched replication sample further supports that differences in GI are likely present across a

TE
D

broad spectrum of ASD phenotypes. Further, due to the assessment of lobar GI, stretching over
large patches of cortex, the regional correspondence with forceps minor connectivity may not be
optimal. Even though the forceps minor branches out within the prefrontal cortex, more accurate

EP

spatial correspondence could potentially be achieved with local, vertex-wise GI metrics.
However, such an approach would be more prone to partial volumning effects, which are

AC
C

minimized in the current study. Another limitation is the cross-sectional design of the study.
Developmental studies will inarguably benefit from a longitudinal set-up to better deal with
individual differences that are not adequately captured in cross-sectional designs. However, the
results presented in the current study may provide a valuable framework for such future studies.
In conclusion we found evidence for decreased gyrification in children and adolescents
with ASD, which was related to developmental changes in forceps minor connectivity. These
findings provide a more comprehensive neuroanatomical characterization of ASD involving
related microstructural white matter and macrostructural cortical grey matter changes. Our

Replication Sample: Inclusion of the New York University (NYU) Langone Medical Center

AC
C

The NYU Langone Medical Center sample is part of the Autism Brain Imaging Data
Exchange (ABIDE4) repository (http://fcon_1000.projects.nitrc.org/indi/abide/). ABIDE is a
grass-roots initiative providing previously collected magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
datasets and phenotypic information from individuals with ASD and age-matched typically
developing controls to promote data sharing and discovery science in the broader scientific
community. We selected this site within the ABIDE repository because it provided welldistributed data along the developmental continuum from late childhood to early adulthood.
All participants from the NYU Langone sample within the same age range as the
Madrid sample were initially included in the replication dataset. Detailed information on

ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT
recruitment procedures, inclusion and exclusion criteria, and clinical and cognitive
assessments for these participants is provided on the ABIDE website.4 Before starting,
participants and their parents or legal guardians signed an informed consent document

RI
PT

after receiving an explanation of the study procedures.

Replication Sample: MRI Acquisition and Participant Exclusion

All participants were scanned on the same 3T Siemens Allegra scanner. A T1-

SC

weighted 3D volumetric image with a voxel size of 1.3x1.3x1.0 mm3 (TR = 2530 ms, TE =
3.25 ms, flip angle = 7º) was acquired. As stated on the ABIDE website, the ABIDE dataset

M
AN
U

is distributed without any quality control; therefore, intensive empirical inspection was
performed for each participant. This led to the exclusion of 29 participants, listed in Table
S3 along with the reason for their exclusion. In total, 39 children with ASD and 65 typically
developing children were included in the replication sample that was used for analysis.

TE
D

Replication Sample: Comparison of Excluded Participants and Remaining Participants
We compared the excluded participants with the remaining participants and found
no differences in demographic or cognitive measures (Table S4). From the remaining

EP

sample (n=156), we selected all participants within the same age-range as the Madrid
sample, resulting in a final sample of 104 participants (39 participants with ASD, 65 typically

AC
C

developing controls).

Madrid Sample: MRI Acquisition Parameters
Three MRI scans were acquired sequentially: A T1-weighted 3D volumetric image
consisting of 175 contiguous sagittal slices, with a voxel size of 1x0.94x0.94 mm3
(repetition time (TR) = 25 ms, echo time (TE) = 9.2 ms, flip angle = 30º), a T2-weighted
turbo spin echo scan, voxels size 1x1x3 mm3 (TR = 5809 ms, TE = 120 ms), and a diffusion
tensor image (DTI) scan consisting of 60 axial slices with 15 directions, with a voxel size of
1.75x1.75x2 mm3 (b0 = 800 ms, TR = 10927 ms, TE = 82 ms, flip angle = 90º). Both T1-

ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT
and T2-weighted images were used for clinical neurodiagnostic evaluation by an
independent neuroradiologist. No participants showed clinically significant brain pathology.

Madrid and Replication Sample: Surface Area and Gyrification Index
Following the method by Su and colleagues,5 a 3D brain envelope was computed per lobe

RI
PT

as follows: first, the cortical gyral parcellation of FreeSurfer’s ‘aparc+aseg’ volumetric image
was relabeled prefrontal, parietal, temporal and occipital, in accordance with the surfacebased lobar parcellation. Second, the brain envelope was defined per hemisphere as the

SC

area of a smooth envelope that wrapped around the hemisphere but did not encroach into
the sulci. In order to generate the envelope, a morphological isotropic closing of 6 mm was

M
AN
U

applied to the relabeled ‘aparc+aseg’ image to ensure smooth boundaries. Then, an
unlabeled envelope was created using the marching cubes algorithm. Finally, the envelope
was parcellated into lobes using the smoothed parcellated volumetric image and a nearest
neighbor interpolation algorithm (Figure S1). This parcellation includes the insula but not
the cingulate cortex, as this structure cannot be assigned to a single lobe. This also

TE
D

permitted quantification of the surface area (SA) of the brain envelope.6,7 The Matlab scripts
used for generating the parcellated brain envelope can be found at:

Madrid-Sample: DTI Preprocessing and Data Quality Assessment

AC
C

In order to detect and correct any artifacts introduced during collection of the DTI scan, a
quality control protocol was implemented. First, artifacts related to intensity were detected
by computing the normalized correlation between intensity in successive slices across the
diffusion volume. Any diffusion volumes containing one or more artifacts were excluded.
Next,

eddy-current

and

was

performed

using

FSL

(www.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/) tools.8 Finally, machine-related (i.e., B0 field inhomogeneity)
spatial distortions were corrected by warping each participant's T2-b0 image to the
anatomical T2-weighted image of the same individual. This technique produces (a) a warp-

ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT
field, which was applied to the participant's diffusion volumes and (b) a Jacobian map of the
warp-field, which was multiplied with the participant's warped diffusion volumes in order to
restore true image intensity after warping. To achieve high dimensional and robust warping,
we computed large-deformation diffeomorphic mapping using the symmetric normalization

RI
PT

(SyN) technique implemented in the Advance Normalization Tools (ANTS) software
package (http://stnava.github.io/ANTs/).9 This warp-field was applied to the anteriorposterior axis of the participant, i.e. the phase-encoding direction (y-coordinate), reducing
the geometric distortion that was present along that axis, while preserving the signal in the

SC

other axes.

Data quality was quantified using four different measures (average translation,

M
AN
U

average rotation, percentage bad slices, and average drop-out score). These four motion
measures capture global frame-to-frame motion as well as the frequency and severity of
rapid slice-to-slice motion.10 We compared these measures between groups and found only
