low frequency fluctuations within intrinsic connectivity
networks for school-age boys with ADHD

ABSTRACT
Background: ADHD is a prevalent brain disorder in school-age children. To our knowledge,
the development of intrinsic connectivity networks (ICNs) remains unclear for children with
ADHD. The goals of this paper are two-folds: 1) modeling the ICN-related brain connectivity
based on phenotype scores; 2) exploring the altered growth curves of ICNs for ADHD.
Methods and Findings: A cohort of boys with ADHD and a cohort of normal controls were
recruited from ADHD-200 Consortium. Amplitude of low frequency fluctuations (ALFFs) was
applied to measure the brain connectivity within ICNs. Quantic models consisted of age; IQ,
behavioral scores and head motion were applied to investigate the relationships between
brain developments and intra-ICN ALFFs. The results found that the lateral visual network
and executive control network were nonlinearly correlated to aging in both ADHD group and
normal control group. Based on intra-ICN ALFFs, the turning points of brain developments
might be 11-12 years old for ADHD.
Conclusions: The lateral visual network, cerebellum network, auditory network, and executive
control network might play important roles in the brain development of ADHD. The abnormal
developmental trajectories of ADHD could be discovered by intra-ICN ALFFs, which could be
a potential biomarker for functional connectome.

Introduction
ADHD is a common brain disorder observed
in school-age children [1]. Structural MRIrelated studies found decreased brain volume
and thinning cortical thickness in patients with
ADHD [2,3]. Diffusion MRI-related studies
found altered white matters in ADHD [4].
Resting-state functional MRI-related studies
found patients with ADHD exhibited altered
amplitude of low frequency fluctuations (ALFFs)

and regional homogeneity (ReHo) [5,6], most of
which were located in default mode networkrelated brain regions [7,8].
In addition to the distinctive brain mechanisms
in ADHD, the abnormal brain developmental
patterns in ADHD have also been reported
by many studies. The cerebellar developments
measured by volume size were lagged in
children and adolescents with ADHD [9]. The
maturations of cortical thickness and surface

area were both delayed in children with ADHD
[10]. Furthermore, growth curves of cortical
thickness were related to different IQ levels in
children with ADHD [11]. Lagged functional
connectivities were found between sensorymotor and default mode-related resting state
networks in children with ADHD [12]. Lagged
maturations of functional connectivity within
default mode network and between certain brain
networks were reported by analyzing a large
sample of children with ADHD [13]. Therefore,
MRI-based measures might be beneficial to
investigate brain maturations for ADHD.
However, the developmental patterns of largescale brain networks remain unclear for children
with ADHD.

boys (8-14.92 years old) were recruited from
the Peking site of ADHD-200 Consortium
[18]. The ethic of this study has been approved
by functional 1000 connectome project. All
patients and normal controls were diagnosed
using the Schedule of Affective Disorders and
Schizophrenia for Children-Present and Lifetime
Version (KSADS-PL). The clinical symptoms
of patients were evaluated with ADHD Rating
Scale (ADHD-RS) IV. The Intelligence Quotient
(IQ) scores for all participants were measured
using Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Chinese
Children-Revised (WISCC-R). In addition, the
patient group contains three subtypes of ADHD.
Of note, certain patients exhibited secondary
clinical symptoms (Table 1).

Abnormal large-scale brain networks were
reported in patients with ADHD [14]. The altered
spatial components of default mode network
were discovered in ADHD using independent
component analysis [15]. However, multivariate
spatial features of intrinsic connectivity networks
(ICNs) might lead difficulties in fitting the
growth curves for patients. Thus, univariate
features might benefit the research of ICN-related
brain development for ADHD. Recently, the
univariate temporal complexity of ICN dynamics
was found with good test-retest reliability [16] and
could reflect the information flows within brain
networks [17]. The above findings suggested that
the temporal dynamics of ICN could be potential
biomarkers for brain disorders. Therefore, the
Univariate temporal patterns of ICN might
possess biological meanings in some extent, and
could be beneficial for investigations of ADHD
development.

Both structural and resting state functional
images were collected for each participant.
The high-resolution T1-weighted images
were obtained using Magnetization Prepared
Rapid Acquisition Gradient Echo (MPRAGE)
sequences. The resting state images were
obtained using standard echo-planar imaging
(EPI) sequences. Participants were instructed to
relax and remain still with eyes either open or
closed during scan sessions. A black screen with
a white cross was presented to each participant
during the scan. The detailed information of
scan parameters could be found on the website
of ADHD-200 Consortium [19].

Based on previous studies, we hypothesized
that children with ADHD, particularly schoolage boys, might have abnormal developmental
trajectories of brain networks, which could be
detected by temporal complexity within ICNs.
To test this hypothesis, ALFFs were used as
temporal pattern to analyze the information flow
within ICNs for patients and normal controls.
Moreover, the relationships between age and
intra-ICN ALFFs were analyzed using regression
models. The altered developmental trajectories of
intra-ICN ALFFs were discovered by comparing
ADHD group with normal control group.

 Preprocessing

The pipeline of data preprocessing was based
on FSL [20] and AFNI [21], according to the
scripts of functional 1000 connectome project
[22]. The structural images were skull-stripped
and nonlinearly transformed into MNI brain
space. The preprocessing for resting state images
contained the following steps: 1) discarded the
first five volumes; 2) slice-timing; 3) motion
correction; 4) regressing out Friston-24 motion
parameters, CSF, whiter matter, global signal,
as well as linear and quantic trends; 5) spatial
smoothing using Gaussian kernel of FWMH = 6
mm; 6) nonlinearly normalized into MNI space
with spatial resolution of 3 mm × 3 mm × 3 mm.
 Intra-ICN ALFFs

The amplitude of low frequency fluctuations
(ALFF) is a popular measure for resting state
fMRI [6]. Here, ALFFs were applied to
investigate the temporal dynamics within ICNs
[23]. Ten well-established templates of ICNs
[24] were illustrated in Figure 1 and Table 2. The
spatial components of ICNs were consisted of

Abnormal developmental trajectories of amplitude of low frequency fluctuations within intrinsic
connectivity networks for school-age boys with ADHD
visual, default mode, cerebellum, sensorimotor,
auditory, executive control, and frontoparietalrelated networks. For detailed information of
the spatial components of ICNs and spatial
regression, please see [25] and [16]. First,
spatial general linear regressions were applied
between the 3-dimentional maps of template
ICNs and functional volumes. Then, the timecourses of ICNs were generated by temporally
concatenating the beta values returned by spatial
regressions. Finally, the intra-ICN ALFFs (0.010.1Hz) were computed by conducting FastFourier Transform (FFT) on the individual
time-courses of corresponding ICNs.

 Models for developmental trajectories

Quadratic models were applied to investigate
the nonlinear relationships between age and
intra-ICN ALFFs. Here, equation 1.1 denoted
formula of the quadratic model, where the age,
IQ, inattention, impulsivity and head motion
might have influences on the intra-ICN ALFFs.
In this paper, head motion was measured by
mean frame displacement (mFD) [26]. The IQ
was indicated by full IQ values. The clinical
scores of inattention and impulsivity were
measured by ADHD-RS. Finally, the impacts
of age on intra-ICN ALFFs were analyzed by
regressing out the covariates of IQ, inattention,
impulsivity and head motion. The comparisons
between ADHD and normal control groups of
growth curves were applied by the growthcurve
function in the statmod packages [27].
Intra-ICN ALFFs = 1 + age + age2 + IQ +
inattention + impulsivity + mFD (1.1)
Results
The developmental trajectories of intra-ICN
ALFFs were successfully modeled by phenotype
scores. Significant age-related effects on the
developmental trajectories of intra-ICN ALFFs
were found for certain ICNs. In addition, altered
growth curves were found between ADHD group
and normal control group. The turning points of
brain developmental trajectories were also found
for ADHD patients and normal controls.

 Altered development of intra-ICN ALFFs

between ADHD group and normal control
group

Table 5 and Figure 2 show the altered development
of intra-ICN ALFFs between ADHD group and
normal control group. Compared to normal
control group, the U shapes of the growth
curves for certain networks are altered in
ADHD group. The developmental curves for
lateral visual network, auditory network, and
executive control network are significantly
altered between the two groups. Table 6
shows the turning points of developmental
brains for ADHD group and normal control
group. Based on intra-ICN ALFFs within
lateral visual network, auditory network, and
executive control network, the turning points
of brain developments might be 11-12 years
old for ADHD.
Discussions
In this paper, we investigated the
developmental curves of large-scale networks
for school-age boys with ADHD by analyzing
the ALFFs within intrinsic connectivity
networks (ICNs). To our knowledge, this
was the first study attempted to model the
growth curves of ICNs for ADHD’s brain.
The results demonstrated that the maturity of
functional connectivity within ICNs might be

delayed in children with ADHD, suggesting
the intra-ICN ALFFs could be beneficial
to investigating the development of human
functional connectome.
Patients with ADHD were reported with altered
functional connectivity in sensory-related brain
regions. Our results found that the developments
of intra-ICN ALFFs were altered in lateral visual
network, cerebellum, and auditory network.
Abnormal structural connectivity between
thalamus and sensory-motor cortex was found in
patients with ADHD based on DTI tractography
[28]. Altered ALFF of left sensory-motor cortex
were found in children with ADHD using
resting state fMRI [6]. Disrupted functional
connectivity between default mode network
and visual network was found in children with
ADHD [29]. The above studies supported our
findings that the development of sensory-related
brain network might be lagged in patients with
ADHD.
The abnormal developments of intra-ICN
ALFFs in executive control network suggested
that the executive function might be altered in
patients with ADHD. The abnormal executive
control network might reflect the dysfunction of
action-inhibition as well as emotion-regulation in
ADHD [25]. The executive control-related brain
regions also exhibited thinning cortical thickness,
according to a previous study based on brain
morphometry [2]. Overall, the intra-ICN ALFFs in

Abnormal developmental trajectories of amplitude of low frequency fluctuations within intrinsic
connectivity networks for school-age boys with ADHD
executive control network might play an important
role in the developments of ADHD.
The developmental trajectories based on intraICN ALFFs exhibited as U-shaped curves
for patients with ADHD during childhood.
Previous findings suggested that the lagged brain
development might explain the vulnerability of
the patients’ attention [13]. The linear model
based on inter-ICN connectivity also found slow
maturation in children with ADHD [12]. Our
results provided additional information of brain
maturation-related studies. The U-shaped curves
indicated the turning points of brain maturation
might be 11-12 years old for children with
ADHD. Moreover, the U-shaped curves implied
that the brain developments of ADHD might be
delayed before 11-12 years old, and the growth
might be out of control after the pitch age. In
summary, the results confirmed that the brain
maturation were delayed and then distracted in
patient group, and suggested that there might
be a pitch point during brain development for
patients with ADHD.
One advantage of this study was applying intraICN ALFFs to investigate the brain developments
for children with ADHD. The intra-ICN ALFFs
were univariate features, which could reflect the
information flow within ICNs. Moreover, the
computation procedure for intra-ICN ALFFs was
simple and easy for implementation. Thus, the
intra-ICN ALFFs could be potential biomarker
to measure the temporal dynamics within ICNs.
Another advantage of this study was modeling
the growth curves of large-scale networks for
ADHD. So far, to the best of our knowledge,
this might be the first attempt to investigate the
brain developmental trajectories for ADHD
based on ICNs. In addition, our study found
out the turning points for ADHD group and
normal control group. The informative results
could provide supplementary evidences for brain
developments from different aspects.
One limitation of this study was relatively small
size of research population (80 ADHDs and
77 normal controls). To remove the effects of
scan parameters, gender and clinical scales, we
only considered a cohort of boys with ADHD
and a cohort of age-matched normal controls
in this prospective study. Although the research
population is sufficient for a pilot study, we
should extend this study on multi-sites datasets
with different subtypes, medication status, scan

study. Another limitation was the limited
frequency bands for intra-ICN ALFFs (0.010.1Hz). In future study, we should consider
wavelets transform or split the intra-ICN
ALFFs into different frequency bands [30]. In
addition, other univariate metrics (i.e., entropy,
Hurst exponent) could also be considered and
compared as intra-ICN complexity in future
study [31,32].
Conclusion
In conclusion, intra-ICN ALFFs were applied to
analyze the development of ICNs for children
with ADHD. The abnormal developments of
large-scale network were found in sensory and
execution-related ICNs for patients group. The
results suggested that the intra-ICN ALFFs could
be supplemental biomarkers for neuroimaging
studies.
