Malformations of cortical development are found at higher rates in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) than in
healthy controls on postmortem neuropathological evaluation but are more variably observed on visual review
of in-vivo MRI brain scans. This may be due to the visually elusive nature of many malformations on MRI.
Here, we utilize a quantitative approach to determine whether a volumetric measure of heterotopic gray matter
in the white matter is elevated in people with ASD, relative to typically developing controls (TDC). Data from a
primary sample of 48 children/young adults with ASD and 48 age-, and gender-matched TDCs, selected from
the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE) open-access database, were analyzed to compare groups on
(1) blinded review of high-resolution T1-weighted research sequences; and (2) quantitative measurement of
white matter hypointensity (WMH) volume calculated from the same T1-weighted scans. Groupwise WMH volume comparisons were repeated in an independent, multi-site sample (80 ASD/80 TDC), also selected from
ABIDE. Visual review resulted in equivalent proportions of imaging abnormalities in the ASD and TDC group.
However, quantitative analysis revealed elevated periventricular and deep subcortical WMH volumes in ASD.
This ﬁnding was replicated in the independent, multi-site sample. Periventricular WMH volume was not associated with age but was associated with greater restricted repetitive behaviors on both parent-reported and
clinician-rated assessment inventories. Thus, ﬁndings demonstrate that periventricular WMH volume is elevated
in ASD and associated with a higher degree of repetitive behaviors and restricted interests. Although the etiology
of focal WMH clusters is unknown, the absence of age effects suggests that they may reﬂect a static anomaly.

1. Introduction
Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) refers to a neurodevelopmental
disorder characterized by impairment in social communication and
restricted repetitive behaviors and interests (American Psychiatric
Association, 2013; Lai et al., 2013; World Health Organization, 1992).
Although ASD is a heterogeneous diagnosis with diverse etiologies
(Happé et al., 2006; Tuchman et al., 2009), early failures in neuronal
genesis, maturation, and migration have been proposed as a root pathological mechanism (Casanova and Casanova, 2014; Ecker and Murphy,

2014). This hypothesis is supported by high rates of developmental
malformations in people with ASD on post-mortem neuropathological
evaluations (Casanova et al., 2013; Stoner et al., 2014; Wegiel et al.,
2010, 2012). Patchy regions of dyslaminated cortex and immature,
maloriented neurons, termed “focal cortical dysplasia,” are found in
up to 91% of ASD brains, relative to 1% of control brains (Stoner et al.,
2014). Overproliferation of neurons in the ventricular zone and/or failure to detach and migrate to the cortical zone can result in heterotopic
gray matter in the white matter of up to 31% of ASD brains; whereas, no
such anomalies were found in age-matched control brains (Wegiel
et al., 2010). However, the small sample sizes of these postmortem studies limit generalization to the larger ASD and control population. Detection of morphological abnormalities with in-vivo MRI would allow for
more extensive sampling across diverse ASD populations and age
ranges. This study aims to determine whether a quantitative marker
of heterotopic gray matter on in-vivo MRI (Pardoe et al., 2015) is

elevated in children and young adults with ASD, relative to typically developing controls.
Thus far, conventional visual analysis of MRI scans has not resulted
in strong evidence for malformations of cortical development as a core
ﬁnding in ASD (Boddaert et al., 2009; Vasa et al., 2012). This may be
due to limitations in MRI-visibility of many malformations (Colombo
et al., 2009). Although malformations such as tuberous sclerosis are
grossly apparent on visual review, others can be visually elusive, such
as periventricular heterotopia and focal cortical dysplasia (Bernasconi
et al., 2011; Pascher et al., 2013). Periventricular heterotopia detection
is improved with quantitative MRI methods. In people with epilepsy,
46% of heterotopias detected with quantitative MRI were previously
overlooked on conventional visual analysis (Pascher et al., 2013).
In the current study, we applied a quantitative approach for detection
of periventricular abnormalities in ASD. We segmented and quantiﬁed
clusters of white matter hypointensity (WMH) on T1-weighted MRI
scans using a method that has been validated as a measure of heterotopic
gray matter volume in patients with periventricular heterotopia (Pardoe
et al., 2015). Children/young adults with ASD were compared to ageand gender-matched typically developing controls (TDCs) on: (1) ﬁndings
from blinded visual review of high resolution T1-weighted research MRI
scans; and (2) WMH volumetric quantiﬁcation from the same scans.
We selected data from the ABIDE repository (Di Martino et al., 2014);
for primary analyses we used images acquired from a single scanner
and calculated total WMH volume, which included WMH labeled voxels
in the periventricular and deep subcortical white matter, as well as the
cortical gray–white matter boundary and perivascular spaces. We then
removed clusters from the gray–white matter boundary and perivascular
spaces to create a WMH-corrected volume of periventricular and deep
subcortical white matter clusters only. To evaluate the reliability of our results, we quantiﬁed total WMH volume and WMH-corrected volume in
an independent, multi-site sample, also selected from the ABIDE repository. We hypothesized that WMH volume would be elevated in ASD, relative to TDCs, in the periventricular and deep subcortical white matter,
reﬂecting failures in neuronal migration (i.e., heterotopia), oligodendrocyte maturation (i.e., dysmyelination), or other processes.
In addition, we tested the hypothesis that elevated WMH volume has
early developmental origins by examining the effect of age on WMHcorrected volume. If WMH reﬂects neurodevelopmental malformations,
then WMH volume should not change with age. Rather, these developmental anomalies remain fairly static across the lifespan. This is in contrast to other possible etiological factors for hypointense signal in the
white matter such as delayed myelination (Cheng et al., 2010; Lee et al.,
2007; Shukla et al., 2011; Wolff et al., 2012), which should show age
effects.
Finally, we tested whether elevated periventricular and deep
subcortical WMH volume is associated with a loss of functional integrity by performing correlations between WMH-corrected volume
and ASD symptom severity on both parent reported and clinician
rated symptom measures. Given the location of WMH-corrected
clusters in periventricular regions proximal to striatal networks,
we hypothesized that elevated WMH-corrected volume would be
associated with increased restricted repetitive behaviors, which
are subserved by striatal–prefrontal pathways (Langen et al.,
2011a,b; Lewis and Kim, 2009).

2. Methods and materials
2.1. Participants
Data were selected from the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange
(ABIDE) repository (fcon_1000.projects.nitrc.org/indi/abide/). ABIDE is
an aggregated and openly shared fully anonymized neuroimaging and
phenotypic database that was collected across 17 research sites (Di
Martino et al., 2014). All data shared in ABIDE were obtained with

37

informed consent/assent according to procedures established by the
human subjects research board at the respective institutions.
2.1.1. Autism spectrum disorder diagnosis
As detailed elsewhere (Di Martino et al., 2014), acquisition and
study protocols varied across each contributing site. Inclusion in
the ASD group was based on a DSM-IV-TR clinician diagnosis of Autistic
Disorder, Asperger's Disorder, or Pervasive Developmental Disorder nototherwise-speciﬁed. The term ASD is used to specify this broader diagnostic spectrum. Clinical diagnosis varied by sites; it was supported by review
of available records and administration of the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS; Lord et al., 2000) and/or the Autism Diagnostic
Interview—Revised (ADI-R; Lord et al., 1994). Comorbid manic or depressive episodes, schizophrenia, traumatic brain injury, genetic syndromes,
and epilepsy were generally exclusionary, although speciﬁc exclusion
criteria varied across sites (see fcon_1000.projects.nitrc.org/indi/abide/).
2.1.2. Typically developing controls
For all samples, inclusion as a TDC required the absence of any
current Axis-I disorders or neurological conditions, although procedures
for establishing medical and psychiatric history varied across sites (see
fcon_1000.projects.nitrc.org/indi/abide/).
2.2. MRI scanning and image processing
For the primary sample, imaging was performed at the New York
University Center for Brain Imaging on a 3 T Siemens Allegra headonly MR scanner. Image acquisitions included a T1-weighted volume
(TE = 3.25 ms, TR = 2530 ms, TI = 1100 ms, ﬂip angle = 7°, ﬁeld of
view (FOV) = 256 mm, voxel size = 1.3 × 1.0 × 1.3 mm). For the secondary multi-site sample, scanner type and research dedicated MRI sequence parameters differed across sites with details provided as
Supplementary material (Appendix Table A.1).
T1-weighted scans from all contributing ABIDE sites were rated for
movement artifacts on a scale from 1 (worst quality) to 5 (best quality)
by a reviewer blind to group status. The QA ratings may be downloaded
from the following site: https://sites.google.com/site/hpardoe/cc_abide
(KucharskyHiess et al., 2015). Only scans that received the highest rating (i.e., 4 or 5) were included in this study. Furthermore, scans that
were processed were carefully reviewed for FreeSurfersegmentation errors and excluded if errors were detected. This strict approach to scan
inclusion was employed to reduce the likelihood that signal intensity
abnormalities could be due to motion artifacts, poor image quality, or
segmentation errors (Reuter et al., 2015).
For the primary, single-scanner sample, the initial 186 subjects included 79 ASD and 105 TDC. Of these, 48 ASD participants and 94
TDCs met scan inclusion criteria; 48 of the 94 TDCs were case-matched
by age (+/− 6 years) and gender to the 48 ASD participants (Table 1).
The relatively wide age bracket (6 years) was due to the constraints of
TDC data availability; however, 50% of the ASD participants were matched
to a TDC within +/− 1.5 year bracket, 33% within +/− 4 year bracket,
and 17% within +/− 6 year bracket. T1-weighted scans from the primary
sample were reviewed by a board certiﬁed neurologist (RK) blind to
group status to identify neuroradiologic abnormalities or normal variant
ﬁndings.
In order to build a similarly sized multi-scanner replication sample,
we used the randomize list function in Excel to select subjects from
the eight different sites with the largest number of high quality scans
based on QA ratings (i.e., rated 4 or 5 as in the primary sample). The
resulting replication sample consisted of 80 participants with ASD (69
males/11 females) and 80 TDCs (69 males/11 females) case-matched
by age (+/− 6 years), gender, and site to ASD participants (Table 2).
For this sample, across sites, 84% of the participants with ASD were
matched to a TDC within +/− 1.5 year bracket, 15% within +/−
4 year bracket, and 1% within +/− 6 year bracket.

ASD = autism spectrum disorder; TDC = typically developing control; SD = standard deviation; IQ = intelligence quotient; ADOS = autism diagnostic observation schedule; Comm =

Image ﬁles from all sites were transferred to a Linux workstation for
morphometric analysis. Images from the primary sample were further
processed with the FreeSurfer5.1 software package (http://surfer.nmr.
mgh.harvard.edu). Images from the secondary multi-site sample were
processed with FreeSurfer 5.3. Processing steps include correction for
spatial distortion due to gradient nonlinearity (Jovicich et al., 2006)
and B1 ﬁeld inhomogeneity (Sled et al., 1998). Assignment of a neuroanatomical label to each voxel is based on a manually labeled training
set and Bayesian prior information (Fischl et al., 2002). Labeling is performed by rigid-body alignment of the subject's brain to the probabilistic atlas, followed by non-linear morphing to the atlas. Labels are
generated based on the prior probability of a given tissue class occurring
at a speciﬁc atlas location, the likelihood of the image intensity given
that tissue class, and the probability of the local spatial conﬁguration
of labels given the tissue class. For the WMH measure, the spatial prior
is relaxed to allow for detection of darker voxels anywhere in the
white matter. These darker voxels are labeled WMH and summed to
quantify total WMH volume. Total supratentorial brain volume (TSBV)

is calculated by summation of all surface-based volumes and labeled
voxels inside the pial surface plus any structures that might fall partially
or totally outside of the pial surface (e.g., hippocampus, amygdala, corpus callosum, ventral DC, thalamus, ventricles, and choroid plexus), excluding the cerebellum and brain stem.
Following calculation of total WMH volume, we manually removed
WMH labeled clusters in the perivascular spaces and re-submitted the
images for calculation of remaining WMH volumes. The difference in
values between the original WMH volume and the WMH volume after
removal of perivascular WMH was retained as a measure of “total
perivascular WMH volume.”
To quantify WMH subregional volumes for the periventricular region, cortical gray–white matter junction, and deep subcortical white
matter, we exported individual WMH masks (Fig. 1A) for further analyses in FSL (http://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/), along with ventricle
and white matter surface masks generated during FreeSurfer segmentation routines. To calculate periventricular WMH volumes, we dilated the
lateral and inferior ventricle masks by 3 mm in every direction (Fig. 1B)
and summed WMH-labeled voxels located within the mask. To quantify
WMH volume from the cortical gray–white matter junction, we dilated
the white matter surface in each direction by 1 mm (Fig. 1C) and
summed WMH-labeled voxels within this mask. Deep subcortical
WMH volumes were calculated by subtracting periventricular WMH
volume and gray–white matter junction WMH volume from the total
WMH volume.

The Autism Diagnostic Observation Scale — Generic (ADOS-G) was
administered to all ASD participants in the primary NYU sample. The
ADOS-G is a clinician-administered assessment of social interaction,
communication, play and imagination (Lord et al, 2000). We examined
the relationship between WMH volume and overall ASD symptom severity assessed by the ADOS-G total algorithm score, as well as the Communication (Comm), Social Interaction (SI), and Stereotyped Behaviors
and Restricted Interests (SBRI) subscale algorithm scores. The Communication subscale assesses both verbal and non-verbal communication.
The SI measures elements of social interaction such as eye contact and
responsive facial expressions and the SBRI measures repetitive and
unusual movements of objects and body and repetitive thoughts about
unusual or speciﬁc topics. ADOS scores based on a revised algorithm

overlaid on (B) the dilated ventricle masks (red = right lateral and inferior ventricle; blue = left lateral and inferior ventricle) to calculate the total number of WMH voxels that fall within

WMH voxels that fall within the gray–white matter junction (GWJ).

(Gotham et al., 2007) were available on 34 of the 48 participants with ASD
from the NYU sample. This smaller subset represents the younger participants (below 15 years of age), as the revised algorithm was only available for modules 1–3 at the time of the ABIDE data release and all
participants 15 years of age and above were given module 4. The revised algorithm scores include an overall ASD severity scale
(Gotham-Sev) as well as separate subscales measuring social affect
(Gotham-SA) and restricted and repetitive behaviors (Gotham-RRB)
(Gotham et al., 2007).
The ADI-R (Lord et al., 1994) was administered to the majority of
ASD participants' parents or caregivers in the primary NYU sample
(N = 43). The ADI-R is a semi-structured interview that surveys participants' current behavior across the three domains: reciprocal social
interaction (ADI-R Social), verbal communication (ADI-R Verbal),
and restricted, repetitive behaviors (ADI-R RRB). Scores from these
three indices were correlated with WMH volume to establish convergent validity of ﬁndings across symptom inventories based on
clinical observation (ADOS) and parent report (ADI-R). ADOS and
ADI-R scores were not consistently available across sites for the secondary multi-site sample; therefore, symptom correlations were not
run in the secondary sample
2.4. Statistical analyses
IBM SPSS 20 statistical package was used for analyses. All continuous
variable distributions (MRI volumes and symptom inventory scores)
were tested for normality with the Shapiro–Wilk test. We used logarithmic transformations to correct for non-normal distribution. In all cases
where transformations were utilized, statistical analyses were run on
transformed data; however, descriptive data and visual displays depict
untransformed data. Chi-square analyses were utilized to test for
group differences in the proportion of subjects with neuroradiologic
anomalies detected on visual review. General linear modeling was
used to test for group differences in total WMH volume, with and without TSBV as a covariate. A WMH-corrected volume was derived by
subtracting WMH clusters in the perivascular spaces and gray–white
matter junction from the total WMH volume and this WMH-corrected
volume was compared between the ASD and TDC groups, with and
without TSBV as a covariate. General linear modeling was used to test
for group differences in WMH volume and WMH-corrected volume in
the secondary, multi-site sample, with and without TSBV entered as a
covariate, and with site entered as a ﬁxed factor. Partial correlations
between WMH volumes and age and symptom severity were performed in the primary NYU sample, with TSBV as a covariate. The relationship between WMH volume and symptom severity was
assessed across three behavioral domains (social, communication,

stereotyped behaviors) and two modalities (clinician-rated and
parent-reported).
3. Results
3.1. Sample characteristics
3.1.1. Primary single-scanner sample
There were no differences in age between the ASD and TDC group
(Table 1). Handedness was established with the Edinburgh Handedness
Inventory (Oldﬁeld, 1971). The ASD group had a greater tendency
to left-handedness than the TDC group (Table 1), as well as lower
Full-Scale IQ and Verbal IQ, as is commonly observed in ASD samples
(Fombonne, 1999; American Psychiatric Association, 2013; Lindell and
Hudry, 2013).
3.1.2. Secondary, multi-site sample
Participants from the ASD and the TDC group ranged in age from 8 to
29 years. There were no differences in average age between the ASD and
TDC group t(158) = −0.41; p = 0.97. Categorical information regarding handedness status was available from each site. The proportion of
left-handed (N = 10), ambidextrous (N = 2), and right-handed participants (N = 68) in the ASD group did not differ from the proportion of
left-handed (N = 3), ambidextrous (N = 3), and right-handed (N =
74) participants in the TDC group (χ2 = 4.2; p = 0.12). Full-Scale IQ
data was also available from each site (Table 2). Similar to the primary

sample, average Full-Scale IQ was lower in the ASD group relative to the
TDC group [t(156) = −3.07; p = 0.003]. Table 2 provides site-speciﬁc
descriptive information.
3.2. Visual review of research dedicated MRI scans
Blinded visual review revealed no difference in the proportion of individuals with imaging anomalies between the ASD and TDC groups:
χ2 = 2.12; p = 0.15. In addition, there was no difference in the proportion of individuals with normal variant ﬁndings between the ASD and
TDC groups: χ2 = 0.04; p = 0.84. Detailed results from visual review
are provided in Table 3. Some individuals may have had more than
one neuroradiologic and/or normal variant ﬁnding. The number of actual ﬁndings for each group is reported in Table 3; whereas, the proportion
of ASD and TDC individuals with one or more ﬁndings was statistically
compared. Given that enlarged perivascular spaces (i.e., Virchow–
Robins Spaces) have been previously associated with ASD (Taber et al.,
2004), we performed an additional analysis of group differences in the
proportion of individuals with enlarged perivascular spaces; however,
there was no difference between the ASD and TDC group: χ2 = 1.24;
p = 0.27.
3.3. Group comparison of total WMH volume: primary single-scanner
sample
Total WMH volumes in the combined ASD and TDC sample were not
normally distributed due to the presence of several positive outliers
[W(96) = 0.94; p = 0.0002]; therefore, a logarithmic transformation
was applied, resulting in a normal distribution [W(96) = 0.99; p = 0.9].
Total WMH volumes were elevated in the ASD relative to the TDC group
[t(94) = 2.57; p = 0.01]. The average untransformed total WMH volume
in the ASD group was 2068.63 mm3 (SD = 655.48 mm3), which was
greater than the average total WMH volume of 1765.33 mm3 (SD =
619.99 mm3) in the TDC group (see Table 4).
Group differences in TSBV were also tested, as was the correlation
between total WMH volume and TSBV. TSBV was normally distributed
[W(96) = 0.99; p = 0.9]. There were no group differences in TSBV
[t(94) = 0.76; p = 0.19]; however, there was a positive correlation
between TSBV and total WMH volume in the combined ASD and TDC
group [r = 0.5; p = 0.0000001]. This positive correlation was present
in the TDC group alone [r = 0.62; p = 0.000003] and the ASD group
alone [r = 0.49; p = 0.0004]. Group differences in total WMH volume
were still present when TSBV was entered as a covariate [F = 15.22;
p = 0.0002].
3.4. Subregional WMH volumes: primary single-scanner sample
WMH clusters were found in perivascular spaces (Fig. 2A), deep subcortical white matter, periventricular regions (Fig. 2B–C), and superﬁcial white matter regions adjacent to the gray–white matter junction.
In the ASD group, 15% of the total WMH volume was accounted for by
labeling of the perivascular spaces, which were manually removed

before calculating remaining subregional volumes. The largest portion
of the remaining WMH volumes (70%) were in the periventricular region (left lateral ventricle: 43%; left inferior ventricle: 0.5%; right lateral
ventricle: 26%; right inferior ventricle: b 0.1%). The next largest portion
(19%) was in the deep subcortical white matter and the smallest portion
(11%) in the gray–white matter junction. A similar pattern was observed in the TDC group: 7% of the total WMH volume was accounted
for by labeling of the perivascular spaces. After the removal of these
clusters, 74% of the remaining clusters were from the periventricular region (left lateral ventricle: 46%; left inferior ventricle: b 0.5%; right lateral ventricle: 28%; right inferior ventricle: b0.1%). The remaining WMH
clusters were in the deep subcortical white matter (15%) and gray–
white matter junction (11%). Groupwise descriptive information and
between-group effect sizes for total and subregional WMH volumes
are provided in Table 4.
Visual inspection of clusters in the gray–white matter boundary
region revealed that several may have resulted from partial volume effects, in which the intensity of the white matter is contaminated by local
cortical gray matter (Shafee et al., 2015); therefore, WMH clusters from
the gray–white matter junction were excluded from the total WMH volumes. Subtraction of WMH-labeled clusters in the perivascular spaces
and gray–white matter junction resulted in a “WMH-corrected” volume
that included only WMH clusters from the periventricular and deep
subcortical regions. Group differences in WMH-corrected volume
were signiﬁcantly elevated in ASD [F = 4.69; p = 0.03], and remained
elevated after entering TSBV as a covariate [F = 9.63; p = 0.0002].
3.5. WMH volume and WMH-corrected volume: independent, multi-site
sample
Similar to the primary single-site sample, there were several positive
WMH volume outliers in the multi-site sample resulting in a nonnormal distribution; therefore, logarithmic transformation was applied
to the total WMH volume measure. Total WMH volume was elevated in
the ASD group relative to the TDC group [F = 12.92; p = 0.0004;
ASD: mean = 2367.7 mm3 (SD = 1271.74 mm3 ); TDC: mean =
1883.74 mm3 (SD = 742.13 mm3)] (Fig. 3). There was also a main
effect of site on total WMH volume (F = 4.77; p = 0.00008) but no interaction between group and site (F = 1.13; p = 0.0035).
There were no group differences in TSBV [t(158) = 0.62; p = 0.53];
however, there was a positive correlation between TSBV and total WMH
volume in the combined ASD and TDC group [r = 0.19; p = 0.02]. Group
differences in total WMH volume remained signiﬁcant after controlling
for TSBV [F = 11.15; p = 0.001], which replicates ﬁndings obtained in
the primary NYU sample. In addition, there were group differences in
WMH-corrected volumes [F = 12.36; p = 0.001], which remained signiﬁcant after controlling for TSBV [F = 10.77; p = 0.001]. There was a
main effect of site on WMH-corrected volumes [F = 7.08; p = 0.0001]
but no interaction between group and site [F = 1.06; p = 0.39]. This
demonstrates that elevated periventricular/deep subcortical WMH volumes in ASD were replicated across two independent samples and were
independent of variation attributable to site differences. Groupwise

3.6. Do periventricular/deep subcortical WMH change with age?
There was no correlation between the age of participants and (logtransformed) WMH-corrected volumes for the combined ASD and
TDC group (r = − 0.14; p = 0.17), the TDC group alone (r = − 0.10;
p = 0.50), or the ASD group alone (r = − 0.18; p = 0.22). WMHcorrected volume was positively associated with TSBV (r = 0.42; p =
0.00002) and TSBV was negatively correlated with age (r = − 0.23;
p = 0.03); therefore, we performed a partial correlation between
WMH-corrected volumes and age, controlling for TSBV; results were
also not signiﬁcant for the whole group (r = –0.05; p = 0.61), the
TDC group (r = –0.11; p = 0.45), or the ASD group (r = –0.06; p =
0.71). These ﬁndings indicate that periventricular/deep subcortical
WMH volume does not change with age in children/young adults.

volume and Gotham-RRB scores (r = 0.42; p = 0.01), but not the
Gotham-SA (r = 0.05; p = 0.77) or Gotham-Sev (r = 0.14; p = 0.44)

to behavioral stereotypies. What might be the histological basis for focal
WMH clusters? Does the relationship between elevated periventricular
WMH volumes and restricted repetitive behaviors reﬂect disruption of
frontal–subcortical networks subserving behavioral monitoring and
control? Could morphometric MRI analysis offer unique diagnostic
information in a comprehensive workup for children and young adults
with ASD?

4. Discussion

Delayed white matter development is a common MRI ﬁnding in ASD
(Cheng et al., 2010; Lee et al., 2007; Shukla et al., 2011; Wolff et al.,
2012). In infants at high risk for ASD, abnormalities in fractional anisotropy (FA) are apparent as early as 6 months with blunted growth trajectories evident by 12 months (Wolff et al., 2012). In adolescents and
adults, the age-related FA increases and mean diffusivity (MD) decreases that are apparent in normative samples across several longrange tracts, are diminished in ASD (Cheng et al., 2010; Lee et al.,
2007; Shukla et al., 2011). This raises the possibility that WMH volume
provides an alternative measure of delayed or blunted white matter
development. Regions of reduced myelination might appear as
hypointense on T1-weighted images and increased volume of T1weighted hypointense clusters could reﬂect blunted myelination
trajectories in ASD. However, the absence of age effects on WMH
volume in the TDC group, the ASD group, and the combined TDC
and ASD groups does not support this interpretation. This is not to
suggest that WMH is independent from myelination. Myelination
failures could lead to WMH clusters; however, the absence of age effects indicates that these focal abnormalities in signal intensity reﬂect static anomalies rather than maturational delays.

This study implicates periventricular white matter abnormalities in
the presentation of ASD, particularly in restricted repetitive behaviors,
one of the core diagnostic features. Using a quantitative approach,
we found an ASD-associated elevation in WMH volume across two
independent samples. WMH volume elevations in ASD were robust to
site-related variance in the secondary multi-site sample. The majority
of WMH clusters were located in the periventricular region, with
smaller proportions also found in the deep subcortical white matter,
cortical gray–white matter junction, and perivascular spaces. Elevated
periventricular and deep subcortical WMH volume in the ASD group
was associated with a higher degree of restricted repetitive behaviors
on both ADOS and ADI-R indices; thus demonstrating consistent ﬁndings
across clinician-rated and parent-reported symptom inventories.
Given the robustness of ASD associated elevations in periventricular
and deep subcortical WMH across independent samples, as well as a
consistent relationship with restricted repetitive behaviors across different symptom measurement modalities, our results raise important
questions about the nature of elevated WMH in ASD and its relationship

4.1. What is the potential etiology of T1-weighted white matter
hypointensities?

Factors leading to static morphometric anomalies could include
early environmental perturbations (e.g., maternal infection, inﬂammation, prenatal brain injury) and/or genetic mutations. Rodent offspring
exposed to streptococcal maternal infection show autistic symptoms
and patches of periventricular white matter loss (Bergeron et al.,
2013). Similarly, in preterm newborns, positive results on an autism
screening tool at 2-year follow-up are associated with a history of
chorioamnionitis (by placental pathology), as well as periventricular
white matter damage on MRI (Limperopoulos et al., 2008).
The role of genetic factors remains uncertain in our sample; whole
genome microarrays, extensive ASD panels, and whole exome sequencing were not performed. Therefore, some participants likely carried deleterious mutations associated with high risk of ASD (Pinto et al., 2010).
Such mutations could result in a range of brain anomalies that at the positive extreme could lead to exclusion from the study but to a lesser degree
only be revealed by quantitative comparison to controls (Stefansson et al.,
2014). For example, mutations of the PTEN tumor suppressor gene are associated with aberrant brain growth (i.e., macrocephaly) and ASD symptoms (Butler et al, 2005; Lynch et al., 2009; Varga et al., 2009); however,
neuroradiologic ﬁndings are variable with normal ﬁndings in some patients and cortical malformations in others (DeLone et al., 1999; Lok
et al, 2005; Tan et al., 2007). In a sample of patients with PTEN mutations,
quantitatively determined macrocephaly, and developmental delay,
all had multifocal periventricular white matter abnormalities, characterized by periventricular hypointense clusters on T1-weighted images
(Vanderver et al., 2014). This suggests that similar pathogenic factors
might contribute to larger brain volumes and periventricular WMH.
Among a core set of 197 high-risk autism-associated genes (Casanova
and Casanova, 2014), 88% show a relationship between the gene product
function and neuroblast development. In addition, 80% of the core genes
inﬂuence post-migratory processes of neuritogenesis, synaptogenesis,
and plasticity, primarily by loss-of-function. This indicates that dysfunction within any of the core gene sites can disrupt various processes
subserving cortical development, resulting in a variety of malformations.
Such morphological abnormalities are found at high rates in postmortem
autism studies, with the most common ﬁnding being patchy cortical
dysplasias in the frontal and temporal lobe (Casanova et al., 2013;
Stoner et al., 2014; Wegiel et al., 2010). Subcortical and periventricular
heterotopia are less common yet still present at higher rates in ASD
than in controls (Wegiel et al., 2010). Although elevated periventricular/
deep subcortical WMH volumes might reﬂect increased heterotopic neuronal clusters in ASD, direct correspondence between MRI and histological ﬁndings is needed for conﬁrmation.
4.2. Periventricular white matter hypointensities and aberrant
striatal–prefrontal networks
Animal models of restricted repetitive behaviors implicate three
primary fronto-striatal “loops” supported by periventricular white matter
proximal to the striatum (Langen et al., 2011a,b; Lewis and Kim, 2009):
striatum-motor, striatum-prefrontal, and striatum-orbitofrontal/
cingulate. Disruption of striatum-motor loops can lead to repetitive
non-goal-oriented activity such as motor stereotypies (Lewis et al.,
2007; Saka et al., 2004). Dysfunction in striatum–prefrontal loops can
lead to repetitive goal-oriented behavior such as in obsessive–compulsive
behaviors and perseverative thoughts/behaviors (Birrell and Brown,
2000; Dias et al., 1996). Finally, striatum-orbitofrontal/anterior cingulate
loops subserve motivational aspects of behavioral control (i.e., rewardseeking behaviors) and when dysfunctional, can lead to impulsive or
compulsive behavior (Cardinal et al., 2001; Wyvell and Berridge, 2000).
Aberrant connectivity within or between these fronto-striatal loops can
result in abnormally expressed restricted repetitive behaviors and interests (Langen et al., 2011a,b).
In humans with ASD, abnormalities of striatal structure, function,
and connectivity are commonly observed. Caudate enlargement in ASD
is a consistently replicated ﬁnding (Haznedar et al., 2006; Hollander

43

et al., 2005; Langen et al., 2007; Rojas et al., 2006; Sears et al., 1999;
Voelbel et al., 2006). Glucose metabolism in the caudate is decreased in
ASD, linking volumetric enlargement to decreased function (Haznedar
et al, 2006). Furthermore, caudate enlargement in ASD is directly associated with increased restricted repetitive behaviors (Hollander et al.,
2005; Langen et al., 2007; Rojas et al., 2006; Sears et al., 1999) and increased impulsivity (Voelbel et al., 2006). Regional glucose metabolism
in the caudate and frontal cortical regions is positively correlated in
healthy controls but negatively correlated or uncorrelated in adult men
with autism (Horwitz et al., 1988). Adults with ASD show reduced FA
and increased MD in frontal-striatal tracts (Langen et al., 2012). Resting
state functional MRI connectivity between the caudate and premotor/
pericentral regions is more diffusely organized in adults with ASD relative
to controls (Turner et al., 2006). Diffusely organized striatum-cortical connectivity in ASD extends to the insula, superior temporal, supramarginal,
and fusiform regions, all of which are either uncorrelated with the
striatum in controls or correlated in the opposite direction (Di Martino
et al., 2011). In the absence of age effects, these diffusively organized
striatum-cortical networks in ASD have been described as ectopic, rather
than residual (i.e., immature) (Di Martino et al., 2011). Thus, it is possible
that periventricular WMH contributes to dysfunctional fronto-striatal
networks by disrupting normal connectivity patterns, prompting the formation of more diffusely organized or ectopic fronto-striatal networks.
4.3. Can quantitative MRI ﬁndings inform the debate on the diagnostic
utility of MRI in ASD?
Visual review of MRI scans has not consistently identiﬁed a higher
prevalence of imaging ﬁndings in children with non-syndromic ASD
compared to typically developing controls, despite using comprehensive
imaging protocols (Boddaert et al., 2009; Vasa et al., 2012). However,
variation in ﬁndings might be associated with characteristics of the ASD
sample. When the study sample is limited to individuals with high functioning ASD, imaging ﬁndings are equivalent between ASD and controls
(Vasa et al., 2012). However, when ASD study samples include individuals
with lower cognitive levels, higher rates of MRI abnormalities are obtained, including white matter signal abnormalities, dilated Virchow–Robins
spaces, T2-weighted white matter hyperintensities and a loss of gray–
white matter deﬁnition in the temporal poles (Boddaert et al., 2009).
Given this variability in ﬁndings, the utility of MRI in the comprehensive workup for ASD is debated. According to the American Academy of
Neurology and Child Neurology Society (Filipek et al., 2000), the
American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (Volkmar et al.,
1999), and the American Academy of Pediatrics (Johnson et al., 2007),
MRI is not indicated as part of the routine evaluation of children with
ASD. Early detection of developmental anomalies could inform treatment decisions such as referral for a more comprehensive electroencephalographic evaluation; yet, the costs of MRI indicate that more
robust data is needed to support the diagnostic or prognostic utility of
MRI in ASD. This includes discovery of speciﬁc MRI ﬁndings that
are more prevalent in ASD and an association between clinical or
etiopathologic aspects of the disorder.
In our study, which included individuals in the borderline to superior (76–142) IQ range, with a mean IQ in the average range (109), we did
not ﬁnd elevated MRI abnormalities on blinded visual analysis. It is important to note that visual review included T1-weighted scans only,
which were collected for research purposes. Review of T1-weighted
images alone is not sufﬁcient for clinical purposes and was used here
only to determine whether gross morphological anomalies were present. Thus, our data cannot address the question of whether subtle
malformations of cortical development might be more readily visible
on other imaging sequences. However, we did ﬁnd that the use of quantitative methods allowed for detection of subtle morphological differences between a relatively high functioning group of ASD individuals
and TDCs. These ﬁndings contribute to the debate on the diagnostic utility of MRI in ASD populations in that they provide evidence of elevated

focal white matter abnormalities in a relatively high-functioning ASD
group when quantitative, but not qualitative, analyses were employed.
The relationship to restricted repetitive behaviors suggests that elevated periventricular WMH volume is not an incidental ﬁnding but is associated with one of the central features of the ASD behavioral phenotype.
4.4. Limitations
In the current dataset, T1-weighted images were the only structural
scans available for analysis. A comprehensive imaging protocol including T2-weighted and FLAIR images would be optimal for detection of
focal white matter abnormalities. Although this makes the etiology of
WMH clusters difﬁcult to infer, interpretation of abnormal signal on
T2-weighted images is also limited. Ultimately, only histological data
co-registered to the MR images can address this issue. The limitations
of relying on a T1-weighted scan are offset by several strengths inherent
to the ABIDE sample such as a large number of scans available for analysis, high-resolution anatomical images, uniformity of scanner and sequences, and well-characterized samples.
Enlarged perivascular spaces (i.e., Virchow Robin spaces) in ASD
have been previously reported (Taber et al., 2004). However, we did
not ﬁnd a signiﬁcant group difference in the presence of Virchow
Robin spaces using conventional visual analysis. This does not necessarily contradict enlarged perivascular spaces as a relevant ﬁnding in ASD.
In Taber et al., 2004, grading scales (Heier et al., 1989) were used to rate
dilation from smallest (grade 1) to most dilated (grade 3), which resulted in children/adolescents with ASD showing higher rates of grades 2
and 3 perivascular spaces than controls. We did not utilize a similar grading scale in our visual analysis. Although WMH labeling of perivascular
spaces provides an alternative to a visual grading system, examination
of WMH segmentation and labeling outcomes revealed that enlarged
perivascular spaces, as diagnosed by visual review, were not consistently
labeled as WMH in the automated segmentation routine. Out of the 29 individuals noted to have enlarged perivascular spaces on CVA, 26 were labeled WMH and three were not labeled WMH (conversely, two were
labeled WMH but missed on CVA). In addition, the full extent of the
perivascular spaces was not always labeled. For example, grading systems
(Heier et al., 1989) upgrade ratings to the next level if there are several
small proximal spaces; however, WMH labeling did not consistently
label each of these spaces when present. This suggests that perivascular
WMH volume likely underestimates the volume of perivascular spaces
and should be interpreted with reserve.
An additional limitation is that diagnosis was based on DSM-IV-TR;
therefore, results may be less generalizable to individuals with a DSM5 based Autism Spectrum Disorder diagnosis. Given the removal of verbal deﬁcits as a core diagnostic feature of ASD in DSM-5 criteria, samples
derived from the DSM-5 may be comprised of higher functioning
individuals. However, when combined ADOS/ADI-R data is used to
establish an ASD diagnosis, the majority of participants (93%) meet
DSM-5 criteria for ASD (Mazefsky et al., 2013). Furthermore, in our sample, elevated WMH volume was associated with stereotyped behaviors
and restricted interests, a domain that remains a core diagnostic feature
of ASD in the DSM-5.
Finally, the current sample excluded individuals with a history of
intellectual disability (ID) or epilepsy; therefore, our results are
generalizable only to the subset of individuals with ASD without
these comorbidities. Future studies should make an effort to include
individuals with comorbid epilepsy and/or ID to determine if elevated
WMH volume is related to seizure severity or deﬁcits in intellectual
functioning.
