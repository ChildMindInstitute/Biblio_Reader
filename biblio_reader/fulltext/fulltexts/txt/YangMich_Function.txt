Background
An increasing number of neuroscientific studies gain insights by focusing on differences in
functional connectivity – between groups, individuals, temporal windows, or task conditions. We
found using simulations that additional insights into such differences can be gained by forgoing
variance normalization, a procedure used by most functional connectivity measures.
Simulations indicated that these functional connectivity measures are sensitive to increases in
independent fluctuations (unshared signal) in time series, consistently reducing functional
connectivity estimates (e.g., correlations) even though such changes are unrelated to
corresponding fluctuations (shared signal) between those time series. This is inconsistent with
the common notion of functional connectivity as the amount of inter-region interaction.

New Method
Simulations revealed that a version of correlation without variance normalization – covariance –
was able to isolate differences in shared signal, increasing interpretability of observed functional
connectivity change. Simulations also revealed cases problematic for non-normalized methods,
leading to a “covariance conjunction” method combining the benefits of both normalized and
non-normalized approaches.

Comparison with Existing Method(s)
We verified using a variety of tasks and rest in both clinical and non-clinical functional MRI
datasets that it matters in practice whether correlation, covariance, or covariance conjunction
methods are used.

Extensive neuroscientific research has identified consistent patterns of brain activity
associated with a variety of behavioral processes. In trying to understand the systems-level
mechanisms underlying these activation patterns, researchers have increasingly relied on
functional connectivity – the statistical dependence among brain activity time series. Functional
connectivity has been used across a wide variety of systems and a wide variety of
neuroscientific approaches, such as functional MRI (fMRI), electroencephalography (EEG), and
multi-unit recording (Nolte et al. 2004; Smith et al. 2011b; Buschman et al. 2012). Much of this
research has focused on identifying the basic systems-level architecture of the brain via the
detection of functional connections during resting state (Biswal et al. 2010; Brookes et al. 2011;
Power et al. 2011; Yeo et al. 2011; Craddock et al. 2013). In order to link functional connectivity
to cognition and behavior, however, researchers are increasingly focusing on functional
connectivity differences. Such differences can be between groups (e.g., patients vs. healthy
controls), individuals (e.g., correlating with IQ), temporal windows (i.e., functional connectivity
dynamics), or task conditions. We focus here on measuring and interpreting such functional
connectivity differences.
Despite the common statistical definition of functional connectivity stated above,
functional connectivity results are typically interpreted in terms of neural interactions. This is
likely due to the distinction between what is of underlying theoretical interest – true neural
interactions – and methodological reality. Therefore, we suggest that one can make progress
here by reducing the gap between methods and the phenomena of theoretical interest. In other
words, we suggest that any functional connectivity measure that more closely reflects true
neural interactions is a better functional connectivity measure.
Here we developed a simulation framework to systematically characterize relationships
between functional connectivity measures and ground truth interactions. We designed the
framework 1) to involve signals (neurons/regions) influencing one another, and 2) to be as
simple as possible to facilitate interpretation and to make as few assumptions about the true
nature of brain region interactions as possible. Briefly, the framework involves simply summing
Gaussian random time series consisting of shared signal (time series copied between source
and target), unshared signal (time series that are not copied between source and target), and
noise. The simulations allowed us to identify measures that better reflect neural interactions,
highlighting the appropriateness of some functional connectivity measures over others when
neural interaction changes are of primary interest.
The most common statistical measures used to estimate functional connectivity across a
wide variety of neuroscientific approaches are Pearson correlation and related methods (e.g.,
coherence, partial correlation). These and many other common statistical measures utilize the
concept of “percent variance explained” – dividing an estimate of shared variance by overall
variance (i.e., variance normalization) – to produce standardized estimates of association. While
these measures are frequently useful in other contexts, it was recently suggested that they are

inappropriate for estimating functional connectivity differences (Friston 2011)1. If true, this would
have major implications for the study of brain network function, as an increasing number of
studies use Pearson correlation and related measures when studying functional connectivity
differences across groups, individuals, or conditions (Zalesky et al. 2012a; 2012b).
As an illustration of a limitation of Pearson correlation, it has been shown that increased
noise in neuronal recordings decreases correlations between neuronal time series, even when
the underlying neuronal interactions are unchanged (Behseta et al. 2009). The sensitivity of
correlations to unshared signal (rather than noise per se) may be especially problematic,
however, as this would reduce the interpretability of any detected functional connectivity
difference. For instance, a significant change in inter-region correlation could be driven solely by
increased neural processing by only one of the two tested brain regions. Thus, we use the term
“unshared signal” to emphasize that these effects could be driven by functionally important
neural processes. The same conclusions also apply to the more general concept of “unshared
variance”, which encompasses both signal and noise.
We used simulations to ground our systematic exploration of shared and unshared
signal changes. These simulations revealed a functional connectivity method (covariance)
immune to systematic bias from unshared signal. However, simulations also revealed that this
method is sensitive to possible increases in overall variance/power that may be unrelated to true
brain interaction change. We therefore developed a conjunctive method, in which a functional
connectivity change is only considered significant if it is detected using both a variance
normalized measure (e.g., correlation) and covariance. We then applied this method to
empirical data, determining that it not only provides increased interpretability of results but also
often provides results distinct from current methods in practice. These findings validate a new
theoretical and methodological framework for characterizing functional connectivity differences,
improving interpretability of brain network dynamics.
Due to the complex and potentially counterintuitive nature of the results, we encourage
readers to run the simple simulations themselves, available here:
https://github.com/ColeLab/simplesims/. Seeing and running the code may facilitate
development of an improved intuition for the nature of these functional connectivity measures.
Modifications of the code, including testing of other functional connectivity measures and
different conditions, are encouraged as well.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Functional connectivity estimation
Estimates of time series association were calculated using either MATLAB (version
R2012a) or R (version 2.15.1). Covariance was the simplest measure we used, and was
calculated as:

Friston emphasized the inadequacy of Pearson correlations in terms of estimating indirect influences,
undirected influences, and their tendency for changing due to changes in noise. We focus here on the last
criticism, and touch upon the other criticisms in the Discussion.

Where S is the time series standard deviation. Most analyses also involved the Fisher’s ztransform of the resulting Pearson correlation, which increases the dynamic range of correlation
values to go beyond ±1.0. This is critical when investigating changes in functional connectivity,
as forgoing the Fisher’s z-transform would result in artificial restrictions in dynamics. The

Where var is the time series variance. The beta for each condition was estimated separately for
each condition and subtracted, consistent with generalized PPI (McLaren et al. 2012). The
additional step of including task regressors in the regression model was not included here
because we did not simulate mean task activity amplitude changes (such that they were already
effectively removed from the simulated time series).
Partial correlation was computed as the inverse covariance matrix (i.e., the inverse
variance-covariance matrix). This is a standard procedure, which computes the correlations
between pairs of time series after the variances from all other time series have been linearly
removed. This procedure also normalizes the resulting statistic by the tested time series’
variance (the diagonal in the variance-covariance matrix), thus implementing variance-based
normalization like standard Pearson correlation.
Basic simulations
Simulations were conducted using R (version 2.15.1) (R Development Core Team
2009). Two brain region time series (X and Y) were simulated as linear mixtures of shared
signal (sharedXY; identical across regions), unshared signal (unsharedX and unsharedy), and
unshared noise (noiseX and noisey):

Data for each variable were created using the function rnorm, which produced 200 normally
distributed time points. The original amplitudes were modified only in the case of the noise
variables, which were multiplied by 0.25 such that noise accounted for proportionally less of the
variance than the signal variables. This was repeated 25 times, producing 25 distinct time series

per simulated region.
Manipulations of shared and unshared signals consisted of scaling the relevant
component (i.e., multiplying each time point by a constant) prior to mixing with the other
component to produce the relevant time series. For instance, when increasing shared variance
in both regions, these formulas apply:

Functional connectivity estimates were then applied to the manipulated time series, and
compared to the estimates from the original time series. Statistical significance was assessed
using t-tests (two-tailed, independent samples) on the functional connectivity estimates across
simulated subjects. R and MATLAB code implementing these simulations can be found at:

Phase locked value simulations. We carried out a standard PLV analysis using publically
available software (available at the time of publication at:
https://praneethnamburi.wordpress.com/2011/08/10/plv/). The software implements the
standard PLV algorithm (Lachaux et al. 1999). The simulation data were generated in the same
manner as for the other simulations, except that each simulated subject contributed 50 trials.
This was necessary for the software, which required multiple trials to estimate PLV. Each trial
consisted of 200 time points, and PLV was implemented as though they were collected at a 100
Hz sampling rate, with a filter order of 50 and frequency range of 10-20 Hz. The first 25 PLV
time point estimates were discarded to exclude the initial transient (a common artifact of the
PLV approach) and the remaining values were averaged for each trial. Note that the final znormalization step often recommended for PLV was not applied, since this would more clearly
necessitate that PLV results would look similar to Pearson correlation and related measures
(due to dividing by the standard deviation of the time series, like Pearson correlation).
Biophysical computational model simulations. In addition to the simpler conceptual
simulation we used a well-validated computational model of resting-state functional connectivity
(Deco et al. 2013), extending a local circuit model (Wong and Wang 2006), to incorporate
biologically plausible mechanisms for multiple interacting brain regions, with their activity
translated to BOLD signal fluctuations. We recently applied this model to investigate specific
synaptic parameters in relation to clinical effects. Here we explicitly studied the effects of shared
versus unshared signal alterations in the simulated network. The network is composed of 66
nodes and is a dynamic mean-field model (Wong and Wang 2006), coupled through a largescale anatomical connectivity matrix, which was derived from diffusion tractography in humans
as reported in Hagmann et al. (Hagmann et al. 2008). For our simulations, we extracted the
anatomical connectivity matrix from Figure 1 of Deco & Jirsa (Deco and Jirsa 2012), described
in detail in our prior work (Yang et al. 2014). BOLD signals were simulated via the BalloonWindkessel model, as done previously (Deco et al. 2013). All model parameter values were set
to those used in our prior work (Yang et al. 2014). Specifically, default values were set to
w=0.531, G=1.25, and sigma=0.0004 (amplitude of unshared noise or signal), with remaining
values set to those of Deco et al.
Next, we introduced a common input to all nodes – that is “shared” signal

(amplitude=0.0005). The amplitude of unshared signal specific to each node was represented
by sigma. We parametrically varied both shared and unshared signal parameters across the
entire network. Finally, to compute a measure of model-derived connectivity we used a measure
of connectivity across the entire network termed global brain connectivity (GBC) (Cole et al.
2010). To compute the GBC of each node, we first generated a correlation matrix of each
node’s signal with signals from all other (65) nodes. Values in the correlation matrix were then
converted using a Fisher’s r-to-z transform. Next, for each node, GBC was computed as the
mean value of each of the 65 columns (corresponding to the other 65 nodes) in this transformed
matrix. To compute the average GBC of the network, we took the mean GBC value across the
66 nodes. This effectively yielded a GBC index of the model across parameters. We also
repeated the same calculation using covariance (rather than correlation) prior to calculating
GBC, to examine the functional connectivity of the model as derived using covariance instead of
correlation.

7-task fMRI data collection
The 7-task fMRI dataset was collected as part of the Washington University-Minnesota
Consortium Human Connectome Project (Van Essen et al. 2013). Participants were recruited
from Washington University (St. Louis, MO) and the surrounding area. All participants gave
informed consent. The data used were from the first and second quarter releases, consisting of
data from 139 participants. Data from 21 subjects were not used because one or more of the
data runs was not collected for these subjects, such that data from 118 subjects were included
in the final analyses. Whole-brain echo-planar imaging acquisitions were acquired with a 32
channel head coil on a modified 3T Siemens Skyra with TR = 720 ms, TE = 33.1 ms, flip angle
= 52°, BW = 2290 Hz/Px, in-plane FOV = 208 × 180 mm, 72 slices, 2.0 mm isotropic voxels,
with a multi-band acceleration factor of 8 (Ugurbil et al. 2013). Data were collected over two
days. On each day 28 minutes of rest (eyes open with fixation) fMRI data across two runs were
collected (56 minutes total), followed by 30 minutes of task fMRI data collection (60 minutes
total). Each of the 7 tasks was completed over two consecutive fMRI runs. Resting-state data
collection details for this dataset can be found elsewhere (Smith et al. 2013), as can task data
details (Barch et al. 2013).
7-task fMRI dataset analysis
The 7-task dataset preprocessing consisted of standard functional connectivity
preprocessing (typically performed with resting-state data), with several modifications given that
analyses were also performed on task-state data. Resting-state and task-state data were
preprocessed identically in order to facilitate comparisons between them. Spatial normalization
to a template, motion correction, intensity normalization (normalized to a 4D whole brain mean
of 10,000) were already implemented in a minimally processed version of the 7-task dataset
described elsewhere (Glasser et al. 2013), so we began preprocessing with this version of the
data. With the volume (rather than the surface) version of the minimally preprocessed data, we
used AFNI (Cox 1996) to additionally remove nuisance time series (motion, ventricle, whole
brain, and white matter signals, along with their derivatives) using linear regression, remove the
linear trend for each run, and spatially smooth the data (4mm full width at half maximum). Note
that the main results were broadly similar with and without whole brain (global) signal

regression, though this question is outside the scope of the present study. This preprocessing
step was included to reduce potential motion and other artifacts (Power et al. 2014). Unlike
standard resting-state functional connectivity preprocessing a low-pass temporal filter was not
applied. This was done due to the possible presence of task signals at higher frequencies than
the relatively slow resting-state fluctuations. In order to make this dataset comparable to most
other current fMRI datasets, however, the data were temporally down-sampled (as the last step
of preprocessing) by averaging data from every three consecutive volumes (making a 2160 ms
TR, close to the 2000 ms TR in most ‘legacy’ single-band fMRI datasets). This had an effect
similar to a mild low-pass temporal filter on the data (removing frequencies above 0.46 Hz). We
found that effects were similar with and without this down-sampling step, however.
Data were sampled from a set of 264 brain regions (rather than individual voxels) in
order to make inferences at the region and systems level. We used an independently identified
set of putative functional brain regions (Power et al. 2011) so as to reduce any potential
circularity in analyses (Kriegeskorte et al. 2009). This particular set of regions was also used
rather than anatomically defined sets of regions in order to reduce the chance of combining
signal from multiple functional regions (Wig et al. 2011). These brain regions were identified
using a combination of resting-state functional connectivity parcellation (Cohen et al. 2008) and
task neuroimaging meta-analysis (Power et al. 2011). Data were summarized for each region by
averaging signal in all voxels falling inside each region.
Preprocessing was carried out using Freesurfer, AFNI (Cox 1996), and custom code in
MATLAB 2012b (Mathworks) for the 7-task dataset (using the minimally preprocessed version
of the data (Glasser et al. 2013)). Further analysis was carried out with MATLAB and R.
We estimated functional connectivity using Pearson correlations and covariances
between time series from all pairs of brain regions using MATLAB (version R2012a). For
Pearson correlations, all computations used Fisher’s z-transformed values. Functional
connectivity estimation was straightforward for resting-state data, as there were no additional
steps after preprocessing prior to calculating these values.
For task data, we sought to suppress or remove influences of (across-trial mean) taskrelated activations on task-related changes in functional connectivity. Therefore, we ran a
standard fMRI general linear model analysis, and calculated functional connectivity based on
the residuals. Specifically, each region’s task time series was modeled using a standard general
linear model with one regression coefficient per task. To improve removal of task-related
activation variance, a separate regressor was included for each major 7-task dataset condition
(e.g., face stimuli vs. tool stimuli in the N-back task; 24 regressors total). Note that regressing
out task events using general linear modeling primarily removes the across-trial signal means,
retaining trial-to-trial and sub-trial fluctuations in time series such that these sources of variability
likely contribute the most to task FC estimates (Truccolo et al. 2002; Rissman et al. 2004). The
residuals from this regression model were used for FC estimation, restricted to time points
corresponding to the current task (including a standard hemodynamic lag). Note that results
were similar with and without task activation regression.
Functional connectivity differences were assessed using two-way t-tests paired by
subject. Multiple comparisons were corrected for using false discovery rate (Genovese et al.
2002).

Schizophrenia fMRI dataset analysis
To test the clinical relevance of shared signal analyses, we examined functional connectivity in
a large sample of patients diagnosed with chronic schizophrenia (SCZ). Specifically, we studied
71 SCZ patients and 74 demographically matched HCS obtained from a publicly-distributed
dataset provided by the Center for Biomedical Research Excellence (COBRE)
(http://fcon_1000.projects.nitrc.org/indi/retro/cobre.html). All the processing and analyses
procedures followed our recently published work (Yang et al. 2014). Briefly, SCZ patients were
excluded if they had: i) history of neurological disorder, ii) history of mental retardation, ii) history
of severe head trauma with more than 5 minutes loss of consciousness; iv) history of substance
abuse or dependence within the last 12 months. Diagnostic decisions were reached using the
SCID interview for the DSM-IV. SCZ patients (N=71) and their respective HCS (N=74)
underwent data collection at Center for Biomedical Research Excellence using a Siemens TimTrio 3T scanner. Full acquisition details for the SCZ replication sample and HCS is detailed
previously (Mayer et al. 2013). Briefly, BOLD signal was collected with 32 axial slices parallel to
the AC-PC using a T2*-weighted gradient-echo, echo-planar sequence (TR/TE=2000/29ms, flip
angle=75°, acquisition matrix=64x64, voxel size=3x3x4mm). The acquisition lasted 5 minutes
and produced 150 volumetric images per subject. Structural images were acquired using a 6
minute T1-weighted, 3D MPRAGE sequence (TR/TE/TI=2530/[1.64, 3.5, 5.36, 7.22, 9.08]/900,
flip angle=7°, voxel size [isotropic]=1mm, image size=256x256x176 voxels), with axial slices
parallel to the AC-PC line. All the described parameters were provided via the publicallydistributed website (http://fcon_1000.projects.nitrc.org/indi/retro/cobre.html).
The processing of this dataset was completed independently of the other fMRI dataset in
order to test if the specific processing steps included in the other dataset were necessary for the
reported results (distinct effects with correlation versus covariance). All BOLD data underwent
the following processing steps: i) slice-time correction, ii) first 5 images removed from each run,
iii) rigid body motion correction, iv) 12-parameter affine transform of the structural image to the
Talairach coordinate system, and v) co-registration of volumes to the structural image with
3x3x3mm re-sampling, ensuring all BOLD images across both scanners were interpolated to the
same resolution.
In addition, all BOLD images for the clinical analyses had to pass stringent quality
assurance criteria to ensure that all functional data were of comparable and high quality: i)
signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) > 100, computed by obtaining the mean signal and standard
deviation for a given slice across the BOLD run, while excluding all non-brain voxels across all
frames. Furthermore, all image frames with possible movement-induced artifactual fluctuations
in intensity were identified via two criteria: First, frames in which sum of the displacement across
all 6 rigid body movement correction parameters exceeded 0.5mm (assuming 50mm cortical
sphere radius) were identified; Second, root mean square (RMS) of differences in intensity
between the current and preceding frame was computed across all voxels divided by mean
intensity and normalized to time series median. Frames in which normalized RMS exceeded the
value of 3 were identified. The frames flagged by either criterion were marked for exclusion
(logical or), as well as the one preceding and two frames following the flagged frame.
Collectively, these quality assurances add confidence that typical neuroimaging confounds (i.e.
SNR or movement) are not driving present effect. Lastly, to remove spurious signal in restingstate data we completed additional preprocessing steps, as is standard practice (Cordes et al.

2001): all BOLD time-series underwent high (>0.009 Hz) and low (<0.08 Hz) pass temporal
filtering, removal of nuisance signal extracted from anatomically-defined ventricles, white matter,
and the remaining brain voxels (i.e. global signal) (all identified via individual-specific FreeSurfer
segmentations (Desikan et al. 2006)), as well as 6 rigid-body motion correction parameters, and

We conducted a series of simulations that modeled changes in brain region interactions.
We designed these simulations to be as simple as possible so as to make as few assumptions
about the true nature of brain region interactions as possible. Each brain region was modeled as
a mixture of shared signal (sharedXY; identical across regions), unshared signal (unsharedX;
distinct across regions), and unshared noise (noiseX; also distinct across regions). Each region’s
time series was composed of 200 time points, with equal parts of shared and unshared signals
and one-quarter part noise (see Methods for details). Changes in brain region activity consisted
of differential scaling of each of these components (e.g., multiplying the shared signal by 2)
(Figure 1A). Each simulation was run 25 times, each with two conditions. These simulations
could be considered as simulating 25 subjects during two brain states each (e.g., a cognitive
manipulation, or spontaneous changes across time), or differences between two groups of 25
subjects (e.g., patients versus healthy controls, during a resting-state experiment). Note that we
focus primarily on brain region interactions but conclusions are likely identical for interactions
between individual neurons as well as other forms of brain interaction, though (as we address
with the spectral covariance approach) in many scenarios it will be necessary to account for
temporal lag between time series.
There are multiple possible underlying physiological changes that could result in the
simulated functional connectivity changes (i.e. changes in coupling). For instance, the simulated
increases in shared variance could result from increased synaptic strengths (e.g., due to shortterm or long-term plasticity (Zucker and Regehr 2002; Yao et al. 2007)) or increased synchrony
due to entrainment of neural populations to the same oscillations (Fries 2005). One mechanism
for this type of change could be mediated via pre-synaptic glutamate release along with an
action potential from the presynaptic neuron activating the N-methyl-D-aspartate glutamate
receptor (NMDAR) (Krystal et al. 2003). Alternatively, a change in coupling may reflect elevated
dopamine tone in the same cortical circuit (Vijayraghavan et al. 2007). Importantly, we remain
agnostic with regard to these types of assumptions in our simple model, allowing generalizability
of our conclusions across a spectrum of biological mechanisms. In contrast to shared variance,
the simulated increases in unshared variance could result from increased neural activity
unrelated to shared signals communicated to/from the regions of interest. For instance, there
could be increased processing in one of the two tested regions, or more interaction between
one of the tested regions and another unrelated region (e.g., increased communication between
regions Y and another region Z, rather than between X and Y; Figure 2A). There are likely other
scenarios involving changes in shared and/or unshared signals not mentioned here that these

before and after manipulating the amount of shared and/or unshared signals. Note that we
applied the Fisher’s z-transform so changes among high correlations were not restricted as they
approached ±1.0, but conclusions were the same without this transform. We found that both
correlations (mean corrdiff=+0.52, t(24)=28, p<0.00001) and covariances (mean covdiff=+2.9,
t(24)=30, p<0.00001) increased when the shared signal was increased (Figure 1, left side),
consistent with the mathematical formulation described below. This reflected a larger effect of
region X’s activity on Y’s activity, and vice versa (a 2x increase in each direction). This result is
consistent with common notions of functional connectivity differences as a change in the
amount of inter-region communication.
We next sought to simulate circumstances in which correlation and covariance would
differ. We found that an increase in unshared signal significantly decreased correlations (mean

corrdiff=-0.33, t(24)=-15, p<0.00001), while covariances (mean covdiff=+0.01, t(24)=0.1, p=0.9)
were unchanged (Figure 1, center). Critically, only covariance tracked the shared variance
(which was left unchanged), whereas correlation was decreased by amplification of signal
unassociated with inter-region communication.
Simulations also demonstrated that the results differed when both shared and unshared
signals were increased (Figure 1, right side). With this manipulation correlation changes could
be significantly positive, negative, or show no difference, depending on the amount of unshared
signal change. We focused on the simple case in which there was a 2x increase in both shared
and unshared signals: There was no difference between correlations (mean corrdiff=-0.01,
t(24)=-0.4, p=0.7), but there was a difference between covariances (mean covdiff=+2.8, t(24)=29,
p<0.00001).
Again, only covariance tracked changes in the shared signal, consistent with increased
influence of the regions’ activities on each other. However, the correlation result could be
considered correct if there was some confound affecting both shared and unshared variances in
a similar manner. For example, there could be an increase in overall variance/power that would
result in apparent increases in shared signal along with unshared signal. In the absence of a
confound, however, the simulated scenario seems quite plausible, as increased inter-region
communication could result in increased shared signal along with increased unshared signal
due to greater within-region computation (e.g., information received in a region that needs to be
processed but is unshared with the other region).
Taken together, these simple simulations suggest that covariance differences are
associated with shared signal differences, reflecting true inter-region communication differences
(in the absence of confounds). Given that overall variance/power confounds are possible with all
neuroscientific methods, the conservative approach would be to use both correlation and
covariance in conjunction: those changes in functional connectivity detected using both
correlation and covariance are more likely to be true changes in functional connectivity.
We constructed a flowchart to illustrate this logic (Figure 3). Simulation results of all
possible combinations of shared and unshared variance changes are reported in Figure 4. We
also found that interactions with a third region Z can produce similar effects as a change in
unshared signal when investigating regions X and Y (Figure 2), suggesting correlation-like
measures are also sensitive to a wider variety of interactions irrelevant to the interactions
between the two regions being tested. This was not the case for partial correlations, due to
linear removal of the third region’s variance. However, like Pearson correlations, partial
correlations normalize by overall variance such that results were virtually identical to Pearson
correlation in the simulations reported in Figure 1. This suggests partial correlations retain many
of the limitations of standard Pearson correlations.

Figure 3 – A flowchart illustrating a “covariance conjunction” approach to interpreting functional
connectivity differences. A similar line of reasoning would also work for most functional connectivity
measures (not just correlation; e.g., PPI). Note that simply using covariance would result in a simpler line
of reasoning: a significant covariance difference signifies a shared variance difference. However, as
noted, a potential confound related to a change in overall variance could invalidate a result significant for
covariance only. We suggest that the most conservative approach involves conducting both covariance
and correlation analyses, assigning the most confidence to results that are consistent across both
approaches (the upper-most route in the flowchart).

We next examined a simple mathematical formulation to verify and illustrate the problem
that arises when assessing changes in functional connectivity based on the measure of
correlation. We consider two time series, X and Y, which could be physiological signals from two
brain areas (or neurons). Covariance (cov) provides a measure of how strongly X and Y change
together: cov(X,Y) = (X-X)(Y-Y), where ... is the average over time. Correlation
(corr) is a rescaled measure that normalizes covariance by the variances of X and Y: corr(X,Y) =
cov(X,Y)/sqrt(var(X)var(Y)). This normalization in correlation complicates interpretation of
changes in functional connectivity, because a change in correlation can reflect a change in
covariance or a change in variance.
We framed this problem by considering that changes in correlation-based estimates of
functional connectivity can be driven by both shared and unshared brain signals. We considered
the case where X and Y can each be decomposed into two components: a signal that is shared
between X and Y with variance
, and a signal that is unshared between X and Y with
, and corr(X,Y) =

. Thus covariance reflects

the shared signal and is not systematically altered by the unshared signal. In contrast,
correlation depends on both shared and unshared signals due to the normalization step. This
formulation illustrates the difficulty in interpreting changes in connectivity based on correlation
rather than covariance. For instance, a decrease in covariance purely reflects a decrease in
shared signal. In contrast, a decrease in correlation could reflect a decrease in shared signal or
an increase in unshared signals. We next turn to a numerical demonstration of this problem with
simulated neural data.

Other regression-based methods such as psycho-physiological interaction are similar to
correlations
In the original review suggesting correlations may be problematic when testing for
functional connectivity differences, it was suggested that the psycho-physiological interaction
(PPI) method does not suffer from the hypothesized issues with correlation (Friston 2011). PPI
is essentially the regression of one time series on another (with simultaneously fit nuisance
variables) (McLaren et al. 2012), such that changes in which time series is the “source” and
“target” can give different estimates. Mathematically, the regression beta estimates are
equivalent to covariance divided by the source time series variance (see Methods). Thus, we
predicted that manipulations to the source time series would appear similar to correlations,
whereas manipulations to the target time series would appear similar to covariances. Consistent
with this, we found that increasing region X’s unshared signal (the source) decreased the beta

16

an

us

ip
t

estimate (mean betadiff=-0.29, p<0.00001), while increasing region Y’s unshared signal (the
target) did not change the beta estimate (mean betadiff=+0.01, p=0.7). Thus, PPI and related
regression approaches are similar to correlation with regard to the source time series, but reflect
covariance with regard to the target time series. When manipulating both time series (as in
Figure 1), the regression/PPI approach results were the same as correlations. Note that some
of the sensitivity to unshared variance may be reduced by including task timing estimates as
nuisance regressors (as typically done with PPI, and as done with the empirical analyses
below), yet this would only account for across-trial mean activity such that much of the unshared
variance (e.g., of moment-to-moment and trial-to-trial signals) would remain.
Overall, these results are mostly inconsistent with the previous claim regarding PPI
(Friston 2011). Specifically, contrary to the original claim, there can be a change in a PPI
estimate even when shared signal does not change: when unshared signal changes in both (or
just the target) time series. We found that a variety of other common functional connectivity
measures also showed similar results to Pearson correlation, such as coherence – a commonly
used method for investigating functional connectivity using electrophysiological signals (see
results below, and Figure 4B).

Preliminary extension of approach to lag-invariant methods

Ac

Correlation is the most common functional connectivity approach with fMRI, likely
because its low temporal resolution results in only minimal lags between time series. In contrast,
methods such as electroencephalography (EEG) and intracranial recording obtain data at high
temporal resolution, resulting in lagged correspondence between time series (e.g., 10 to 100 ms
delays in inter-region signal propagation). Therefore, one of the most common functional
connectivity measures with these methods has been coherence, which is robust to lags. This is
possible because coherence measures the correspondence between each time series’ power
across frequencies (i.e., the spectral density distribution). Importantly, coherence is similar to
Pearson correlation in that it is normalized by overall variance. We therefore hypothesized that
coherence would be sensitive to changes in unshared signal, just like correlation.
We tested this hypothesis using identical simulations as used in Figure 1, but tested
using coherence and with a 5 time point lag between the time series. Confirming our hypothesis,
we found that coherence showed the same pattern of results as correlation (in contrast to
covariance). Specifically, there was an increase in coherence when shared signal was
increased (mean cohdiff = 0.40, t(24)=49, p<0.00001), a decrease when unshared signal was
increased (mean cohdiff = -0.07, t(24)=-7, p<0.00001), and no change when both shared and
unshared signals were increased (mean cohdiff = 0.007, t(24)=0.7, p=0.46). Note that there were
no significant changes detected using correlations or covariance with the 5 time point lag.
We next developed a new spectral measure based on covariance, which we
hypothesized would be unchanged by temporal lags or differences in unshared signal. We call
this measure “spectral covariance” (scov). This measure is computed by estimating the spectral
density distribution (i.e., a periodogram) for each time series, followed by measuring the
covariance between these distributions. Intuitively, this is the same covariance approach used
above, but now on the pattern of power across frequencies rather than the raw time series.

Consistent with our hypothesis, we found that this measure matched covariance even with a
temporal lag between the time series. Specifically, there was an increase in spectral covariance
when shared signal was increased (mean scovdiff = 1.4, t(24)=28, p<0.00001), no change when
unshared signal was increased (mean scovdiff = 0.003, t(24)=0.03, p=0.98), and an increase
when both shared and unshared signals were increased (mean scovdiff = 0.71, t(24)=5,
p=0.00002). It therefore appears possible to implement a covariance conjunction approach that
is lag invariant, combining results from coherence and spectral covariance to increase
confidence in a detected functional connectivity change.
We next tested if this method would work when only a small subset of frequencies are
altered, rather than all frequencies. Spectral covariance was not robust to unshared signal
changes in this case. Specifically, there was a decrease in spectral covariance when unshared
signal was increased in a single frequency (mean scovdiff = -0.9, t(24)=-10, p<0.00001). This
suggests this new approach is limited to cases in which broad sets of frequencies are altered. It
will be important for future research to investigate ways to overcome this limitation in spectral
covariance. One possibility may be the use of lagged covariance (testing covariance at various
lags between time series), though this could result in overfitting data due to multiple comparison
testing across many lags. Overall, these results demonstrate a proof of principle for a way to
estimate lag-invariant functional connectivity change that is robust to changes in unshared
signal. More generally, these results suggest it may be possible to modify a variety of other
functional connectivity measures to be robust to changes in unshared signal.

Some characterizations of functional connectivity have focused on phase
synchronization of oscillations (Lachaux et al. 1999; Engel et al. 2001; Aydore et al. 2013). One
prominent method for isolating phase synchronization is phase locked value (PLV) (Lachaux et
al. 1999). PLV characterizes time series in terms of oscillations at a particular frequency range,
quantifying how close the phase is between two time series. Unlike correlation, coherence, and
the other measures, PLV removes fluctuation amplitudes to focus exclusively on the timing of
the fluctuations. One might therefore assume that PLV would be immune to the changes in
signal amplitude implemented by our simulations. We carried out a standard PLV analysis using
publically available software (see Methods) to test this possibility.
Surprisingly, we found that PLV acted very similarly to Pearson correlations and related
measures. We found that PLV significantly increased when shared signal was amplified (mean
PLVdiff=+0.29, t(24)=64, p<0.00001), significantly decreased when unshared signal was
amplified (mean PLVdiff=-0.21, t(24)=-42, p<0.00001), and showed no significant change when
both shared and unshared signals were increased (mean PLVdiff=0.01, t(24)=1.85, p=0.07).
Note the marginally significant effect for the last simulation, hinting at a possible difference from
Pearson correlations and related measures (but not as initially expected).
It is beyond the scope of the present study to fully characterize why these simulations
resulted in PLV changes. However, one possibility is that PLV can be conceptualized as
counting the number of identified shared fluctuations in two time series, with added unshared
signal reducing the number of identified shared fluctuations. This may be due to greater

18
Page 18 of 39

t

corruption of the perfectly in-phase oscillations present in the shared signal by larger unshared
oscillations. In particular, cases in which a shared oscillation would be nearly canceled out by an
anti-phasic unshared oscillation may be completely canceled out with greater unshared signal
amplitude. This is all despite there actually being true phase synchronization underlying the
signals, given the presence of the shared signal across both time series. It will be important for
future research to explore this and other possibilities, as well as developing alternative phase
locking estimates that are not systematically biased by changes in unshared signal.

We next utilized a previously developed biophysically based computational model (Deco
et al. 2013; Yang et al. 2014) to (1) test if the effects identified above are present in a model that
captures neurobiologically realistic neuronal dynamics in a larger network, and (2) to explore the
effect of many possible brain region activity changes on functional connectivity measures using
plausible neuronal dynamics. Population spiking activity in 66 nodes was simulated by a
dynamical mean-field model (Wong and Wang 2006), coupled through structured long-range
projections derived from diffusion-weighted imaging in humans (Hagmann et al. 2008).
Simulated electrophysiological signals were then converted to simulated fMRI blood-oxygen
level dependent (BOLD) signals using the Balloon-Windkessel hemodynamic model (Friston et
al. 2003) to mimic empirical BOLD connectivity data presented below. We quantified effects
across the entire simulated network by utilizing a simple graph theoretical measure known as
global brain connectivity (GBC) (Cole et al. 2010). GBC involves averaging of a given region’s
functional connectivity estimates with the rest of the brain (i.e., connectivity with all other
regions). In this case we compared GBC using correlation versus covariance. We examined
each measure in response to systematically manipulating the amount of unshared and shared
signal between all nodes in the model (Figure 5).

Figure 5 – Neurobiologically realistic simulations reveal the relationship between network
changes and functional connectivity measures. A) Shared and unshared neural signals were
systematically manipulated across 66 simulated brain regions. The two-dimensional parameter space

covariances (cov, circles in each square, the adjacent color bar), averaged across all connections for
parsimony (i.e., global connectivity across the entire set of simulated regions). The color scales indicate
increases (red) and decreases (blue) relative to the central point in the parameter space (white, marked

The modeling simulations converged with the simpler conceptual illustration: only
covariance matched the changes in shared signal (Figure 5A, diagonal). Specifically, covariance
was unchanged from the central “baseline” point in Figure 5A as unshared signal was changed
(horizontally). However, covariance was highly sensitive to changes in shared signal (vertically).
In contrast, correlations interacted with both shared and unshared signals, remaining
unchanged when shared and unshared signals changed equally (diagonally). However,
correlations increased (upper left) or decreased (lower right) depending on the relative
dominance of shared versus unshared signal changes. Note that these manipulations were
implemented at the neural level, and fMRI related BOLD signals were simulated from the
resulting neural activity prior to functional connectivity estimation. Thus, these results support
the possibility that covariance analysis of fMRI data may more accurately reflect changes in
shared signal across brain regions as opposed to artifacts of non-shared signal changes.
One potential concern with using covariances (rather than correlations) for functional
connectivity is the possibility that the entire signal (shared and unshared) could be amplified
artificially. Correlations are unaffected by such scaling due to normalization by the time series’
standard deviations. It is unclear how this could occur in neural populations, however. This
could reflect a change of scale in the data recording equipment (e.g., scale shifts with fMRI),
suggesting a potential advantage of correlation over covariance in practice. Further along this
line of reasoning, it remains unclear how often correlation and covariance changes diverge in
practice. We evaluate the feasibility of using covariance to measure functional connectivity
further below, both in terms of providing reasonable estimates given the possibility of scale
shifts and also in terms of whether it actually matters which method is used in practice.

Empirically validating covariance as a functional connectivity measure
We next sought to test for the general feasibility of using covariance as a functional
connectivity measure based on empirical data. We used the publicly available WU-Minn Human
Connectome Project fMRI dataset (118 subjects) (Van Essen et al. 2013). One way correlation
has been empirically validated as a functional connectivity measure is via its consistency with
known neural systems. For instance, regions in the visual system are especially correlated with
each other relative to other brain systems during resting state, and the same is true of other
known systems as well (Power et al. 2011; Yeo et al. 2011). We used this approach with
covariance, with the expectation that covariance would also be higher within than between

20

neural systems, validating covariance as a functional connectivity measure. Importantly, we
observed correlation and covariance effects relative to zero (i.e., their ability to detect the
presence of functional connectivity) rather than differences between brain states or individuals,
such that both methods should provide similar results.
We used a set of 264 brain regions (Figure 6A) that were previously identified using
fMRI meta-analysis and an approach for identifying areas of locally homogeneous functional
connectivity (Power et al. 2011). These regions were used because they were identified in a
distinct dataset – reducing potential statistical biases in the present results (Kriegeskorte et al.
2009) – and because these regions have an associated regional community partition (Power et
al. 2011) that is consistent with known brain systems.

264 previously identified regions were used because of an associated partition consistent with known
neural systems (e.g., visual, auditory, default-mode). B) Standard resting-state functional connectivity
estimation with fMRI was carried out with 118 subjects using Pearson correlation. Group t-tests versus 0
are reported for each connection, placing correlation results on the same scale as covariances. Labels
are indicated on the right for the putative systems that the regions group into based on functional
connectivity (Power et al. 2011). C) The analysis was repeated using covariance, resulting in a virtually

identical whole-brain functional connectivity pattern (r =0.98, p<0.00001 between the correlation and
covariance t-value matrices). Results were similar for raw correlation and covariance matrices, and
without global signal regression. These results validate covariance as a functional connectivity measure,
while the following results focusing on functional connectivity change demonstrate distinctions between
the measures.

We computed all pairwise correlations (Figure 6B) and covariances (Figure 6C) across
the 264 regions. The regions were ordered based on previous community partition results
(Power et al. 2011), such that connectivity clusters are apparent by visualizing the functional
connectivity matrices (i.e., blocks of red along the diagonal in Figure 6). T-tests relative to zero
were used to put the two functional connectivity measures on the same scale. Note that other
measures of effect size could have been used as well (e.g., z values, Cohen’s d). We found that
covariances revealed a large-scale brain network organization consistent with known systems,
validating covariance as a functional connectivity measure. See the “Details regarding
empirically validation of covariance as a functional connectivity measure” section below for more
details.
These results suggest that while covariance and correlation give quite similar functional
connectivity patterns generally, correlations may be better for detecting the absolute presence
of functional connectivity. This is primarily due to generally higher t-values for correlations
(mean absolute value t=5.4 for correlation, t=4.4 for covariance), associated with 10999
significant (P<0.05, FDR corrected for multiple comparisons) connections with correlation and
10120 with covariance – an advantage of 879 connections with correlation. We used
simulations to confirm this advantage of correlations for detecting functional connections relative
to 0 (though this was only true at low levels of noise; see the “Simulating the advantage of
Pearson correlations for detecting shared signal relative to 0” section below). In contrast, the
above simulations predict that covariance will be better than correlation when testing for
functional connectivity change. We test this possibility next.

Does it matter in practice?: Testing for functional connectivity changes using empirical
data
We next sought to test if correlation and covariance estimates of functional connectivity
change differ in a meaningful way across a large set of tasks across a large set of brain regions.
We estimated functional connectivity using both correlation and covariance during each of
seven task brain states collected as part of the Human Connectome Project (Barch et al. 2013).
These were the same subjects as in the resting-state results above (Figure 6), so we tested for
task-driven changes in functional connectivity from the results above. Focusing on one of the
tasks as a test case – the “Emotion” task versus rest (Figure 7A) – we found that there were

22

4% more significant functional connectivity differences using covariance than correlation,
suggesting changes in unshared signal can often cancel out changes in shared signal with
correlation (consistent with the white diagonal in Figure 5A). Further, we found that 37% of the
results differed between the methods (e.g., a connection that was significantly decreased with
covariance but significantly increased with correlation). This result strongly suggests that it
matters in practice which method is used to estimate functional connectivity differences.

Figure 7 – Correlation versus covariance across major brain systems and diverse cognitive
domains. A) T-tests compared all 34716 connections for an example task (the Emotion task) versus rest
(p<0.05, corrected for multiple comparisons), separately using correlation and covariance. There was a
rough similarity in the pattern of results, but also noticeable differences. Generally, there were many
differences across methods that would alter interpretation of functional connectivity effects. Further, the
above simulations suggest any observed difference with covariance has a clearer interpretation (i.e.,
results are unlikely to be driven by unshared signal changes). B) The percentage of connections
significantly changed (each task versus rest) was computed when using covariance and correlation, then
subtracted. Results from all seven tasks are shown. C) The percentage of the time that covariance and
correlation gave different answers. For each task, the total number of differences in results (e.g., a
connection that was significantly increased with covariance but significantly decreased with correlation)
divided by the total number of significant results across both covariance and correlation approaches.

Focusing further on the whole-brain “Emotion” task versus rest results (Figure 7A), there
23

was general similarity between the results using both methods. For instance, there was a
general tendency toward reduced functional connectivity within brain systems (i.e., blue along
the diagonal) and increased functional connectivity across brain systems (i.e., red off the
diagonal). Notably, however, many increases within the default-mode system with correlations
were not present with covariance, suggesting reductions in unshared signals drove these
correlation results (as opposed to an actual increase in shared signals). Further, there were
increases with covariance between the default-mode and visual systems that appeared as
significant reductions with correlation. Thus, conclusions regarding these large systems-level
interaction changes differ across the methods in meaningful ways.
We next quantified these patterns comprehensively across the seven task brain states.
We found that covariance identified more functional connectivity changes for five of the seven
tasks (Figure 7B). We used simulations to confirm the generally greater sensitivity of
covariances (relative to correlations) for detecting shared signal differences (see the “Simulating
the advantage of covariance for detecting shared signal differences” section below). Further,
greater than 20% of results differed across the methods for every task (Figure 7C). These
results again suggest – in a more comprehensive manner – that it matters in practice whether
correlation or covariance is used when estimating functional connectivity differences between
brain states.

We next applied the covariance conjunction approach (see Figure 3), in which results
are only considered to be statistically significant if they agree across both Pearson correlation
and covariance. As expected, results were both similar and distinct from correlation and
covariance (Figure 8). The Emotion task differed the most between correlation and covariance
conjunction at 20% of the results being distinct, while the Gambling task differed the most
between covariance and covariance conjunction at 27% of the results being distinct. While
results differed more with covariance, both approaches involved a similar order of magnitude
difference with covariance conjunction. These results suggest there may have been false
positives in both correlations (likely from spurious changes in unshared signals) and
covariances (possibly from scale/variance changes), which the conjunction approach controlled
for.
Beyond purely practical implications for which method is used, the above simulations
suggest the observed effects with correlation have a clearer interpretation when combined with
covariance (i.e., covariance conjunction). This logic applies not only to the effects that differ
across the methods, but also to effects that are similar across the methods, since only
covariance is diagnostic of whether shared signal (rather than unshared signal alone) changed
in any given comparison.

A key assumption of the mathematical formulation and computational models is that
unshared variance can change across groups or time, such as when brain processing increases

in fMRI activity amplitude variance). As a first pass at empirically testing this assumption, we
assessed changes in overall time series variance between each of the 7 tasks and rest. We
found that the variance of the following percentages of the 264 regions were significantly
changed from rest for each of the 7 tasks (t-tests paired by subject, p<0.05, Bonferroni
corrected for multiple comparisons): 97.3%, 98.9%, 73.1%, 56.8%, 79.6%, 74.2%, 97.7%. Note
that because this analysis involved overall variance it did not isolate unshared variance
changes, but rather indicates a combination of both shared and unshared variance changes.
We next better isolated unshared variance by regressing out all other regions’ time series prior
to estimating the variance for each region. This revealed the following percentages of regions
(analyzed identically to the previous analysis other than the additional regressions): 82.2%,
92.0%, 73.5%, 78.4%, 74.6%, 75.4%, 93.9%. Thus, there were significant changes in variance
unshared between the 264 regions investigated in the above analyses, which likely drove the
differential results observed between correlation and covariance measures reported above.
Note that all of these analyses were conducted after removing task regressor variance, such
that trial-averaged mean amplitude effects are unlikely to explain the observed changes in
25

unshared variance. This suggests moment-to-moment and/or trial-to-trial fMRI signal variability
changes between rest and task performance – a proof of principle for unshared variance
changes due to brain activity changes in other contexts (e.g., between groups, individuals,
temporal windows).

The distribution of functional connectivity measures across subjects must be
approximately normally distributed in order to utilize standard parametric tests to test
hypotheses at the second (group) level. Fisher’s z-transform is used to allow Pearson
correlation to have this property. We verified this empirically using a standard test of normality,
the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. None of the 34716 correlations in Figure 6B significantly deviated
from a normal distribution (p<0.05, Bonferroni corrected for multiple comparisons). Only 0.3% of
the 34716 covariance in Figure 6C significantly deviated from a normal distribution (p<0.05,
Bonferroni corrected for multiple comparisons). This suggests that it is likely appropriate to use
second-level parametric tests (e.g., t-tests) with covariances.
The whole-brain pattern of covariances appeared similar to those of correlations.
However, there were some large deviations in the raw value covariance matrix that were not
present in the correlation matrix, which were controlled for using group-level t-tests (Figure 6C).
These deviations reflect the fact that unlike correlations (and group-level t-values) each raw
covariance value is in units dependent on the regions being tested (region X variance * region Y
variance units). Thus, if some regions have substantially different activity variance amplitudes
than most regions they will appear as large deviations in covariance. The identified deviations
represented only a small fraction of the total number of connections: 36 covariances above a
value of 2000, representing 0.1% of connections. Most of these deviations were covariances
among subcortical regions. Note that this particular dataset is known to have lower subcortical
signal-to-noise than most fMRI datasets, given that a 32-channel head coil was used (Van
Essen et al. 2013). Correlations do not show these deviations because they standardize their
values by dividing by the time series standard deviations – a solution to this problem but the
cause of the problems identified in the simulations. These deviations were eliminated by
standardizing covariances at the group level using t-tests, which involves dividing each
connection’s across-subject mean value by its across-subject standard deviation (in contrast to
dividing by the standard deviations of the time series with correlations).

Simulating the advantage of Pearson correlations for detecting shared signal relative to 0
We found that t-values tended to be higher for correlations than covariances when
detecting connections (relative to 0) in the empirical data (Figure 6). We next sought to test if
this effect was present in the simulations. Identifying this effect in the simulations would help
generalize the result beyond the particular empirical tests we conducted.
We used the same simple simulation setup as used in Figure 1. We found that with small

26

amounts of time series noise (0.25; the same as in Figure 1) group analysis t-values (testing vs.
0) were consistently much larger with correlations than covariances. To illustrate this we ran 100
simulations, finding that the mean correlation-based t-value was 126, while the mean
covariance-based t-value was 52. We ran a t-test comparing the distributions of correlationbased and covariance-based t-values, to establish the consistency of this result: t(99)=29,
p<0.00001. Importantly, however, this effect went away with high amounts of time series noise
(4x the amplitude of the shared signal). In this scenario mean correlation-based t-value was
4.19, while the mean covariance-based t-value was 4.18 (t(99)=0.16, p=0.9). This suggests that
correlations only have an advantage over covariances at low levels of noise. Generally, we
found – using both empirical data and simulations – that correlations are more sensitive than
covariances for detecting shared signal relative to 0.

We found with most brain state comparisons that there were more significant differences
in connectivity when using covariances than correlations (Figure 7) – the opposite of the result
found when testing for connections relative to 0. We next sought to test if this effect was present
in the simulations. Identifying this effect in the simulations would help generalize the result
beyond the particular empirical tests we conducted.
We found that covariances showed consistently larger t-values when comparing large to
small amounts of shared signal (the same test as in Figure 1, left side). To illustrate this
consistency we ran 100 simulations: Mean covariance t-value: 38.83, mean correlation t-value:
34.82 (difference t(99)=5.05, p<0.00001). Unlike the advantage of correlation for detecting
effects vs. 0, this result was stable at high levels of noise (4x the amplitude of the shared
signal). Mean covariance t-value at high noise: 8.23, mean correlation t-value at high noise:
7.35 (difference t(99)=5.93, p<0.00001).
In summary, we found – using both empirical data and simulations – that correlations are
more sensitive for detecting shared signal relative to 0, while covariances are more sensitive for
detecting differences in shared signal. In most cases, however, we recommend using the
covariance conjunction approach, which will only be as sensitive as the least sensitive measure
(in this case correlation). We next examine a case in which one might choose to forgo this
recommendation in order to take advantage of increased sensitivity of covariance to detect
functional connectivity change.

Measuring functional connectivity differences across groups: Application to
schizophrenia
Above we demonstrated the impact of using covariance (versus correlation-like
measures) as a functional connectivity measure with both simulated and empirically-derived
data in healthy adults. We next examined if using covariance can have an impact on clinical
between-group connectivity analyses where it is expected that one group would differ in
connectivity patterns. To test this hypothesis, we analyzed a large sample of patients with

schizophrenia (N=71) relative to a group of healthy matched controls (N=74). We focused on
the statistical relationship between two large-scale neural systems that have been repeatedly
implicated in schizophrenia – the default-mode network (DMN) and the frontoparietal control
network (FPCN) (Baker et al. 2014). The networks were defined using a voxelwise partition
previously identified in healthy adults (Power et al. 2011). We found that patients exhibited
significantly increased covariance between the DMN and FPCN (Figure 9A). Interestingly, the
effect was attenuated and no longer significant when using correlations (Figure 9C). This
discrepancy occurred because of elevated variance within both DMN and FPCN for patients
relative to controls (Figure 9B). Illustrating the reason for this effect, we present the full
correlation equation in relation to these data (Figure 9, bottom panel). This illustrates that
dividing the covariance by a relatively larger variance for patients will by definition result in a
reduction of the correlation (Yang et al. 2014). Collectively, these clinical effects show how use
of correlations can obscure a possible clinically-relevant difference in connectivity due to
alterations in unshared signals. In contrast, covariance remained sensitive to the connectivity
difference between the DMN and FPCN, a hypothesis suggested by recent work (Baker et al.
2014). Note, however, that even if there were no differences between covariance and
correlation results, the above simulations demonstrate that we would gain additional insight into
these effects by using covariance (e.g., confidence that results were not driven by unshared
variance differences between patients and healthy controls). Further, it should be noted that this
effect could plausibly (but not necessarily) be caused by an overall increase in variance/power,
such that the increase in functional connectivity is apparent rather than actual. We recommend
the covariance conjunction approach (Figure 3) in order to help rule out erroneous conclusions.

Figure 9 – Detected disruptions across functional networks in schizophrenia differ between
covariance and correlation. A) Here we show altered covariance structure between large-scale
associative networks in schizophrenia (SCZ), similar to recent findings (Baker et al. 2014) [t(143)=2.37,
p=0.019, Cohen’s d=0.4]. B) We recently discovered elevated variance across the entire brain in chronic
SCZ, which was particularly evident for associative networks (Yang et al. 2014). C) Based on this
elevated non-shared variance, it follows that the difference in correlations between SCZ and healthy
control subjects (HCS) across the two networks will be attenuated and no longer reveal a significant
clinical effect [t(143)=1.48, p=0.14, Cohen’s d=0.25]. The equation on the bottom is presented for

DISCUSSION

Despite decades of neuroscience research our basic understanding of what constitutes
functional connectivity change (and how to measure it) is still evolving. Attention has recently
been drawn to the issue of increased noise in one condition or group producing reductions in
correlations (and related measures) (Behseta et al. 2009; Friston 2011), potentially resulting in
false positives and false negatives across a range of studies. We postulated that the broader
concept of “unshared signal” change is even more problematic for correlation-like measures.
We reasoned that changes in independent neural processing would likely alter correlations
despite no change in interactions among the tested regions/neurons. We verified this concern
using a simple and generalizable simulation (Figure 1), mathematical theory, as well as a more
complex biologically plausible simulation of large-scale neural dynamics (Figure 5). Across
these analyses, we demonstrate that correlation changes were difficult to interpret due to their
sensitivity to changes in unshared signal. In contrast, we demonstrate that covariance was
sensitive to shared signal alone, increasing the interpretability of observed functional
connectivity change. This was especially true for cases in which both covariance and correlation
agree: the covariance conjunction approach. Following these simulations, we applied this
method to empirical datasets, finding that it mattered in practice which functional connectivity
measure was used, and that covariance provided robust results for both within-subject and
across-group functional connectivity changes. Even if results had been less robust with
covariance, however, we would still recommend its use as our comprehensive characterization
of the relevant parameter space (Figure 4) indicates this measure – especially when combined
with more standard measures – yields increased interpretability of functional connectivity effects
generally.
Our findings suggest results reported by most previous studies of functional connectivity
change (even most that did not use correlations, such as those using PPI) are difficult to
interpret because of ambiguity concerning shared versus unshared signal contributions. This
includes any studies involving a difference in functional connectivity estimates, such as across
groups (e.g., clinical studies), tasks, individuals (e.g., individual difference correlations), or
dynamics (e.g., resting-state dynamics across temporal windows). Note that correlation-based
studies seeking to simply identify any difference (e.g., between groups) are likely valid in their
identification of differences. However, due to the ambiguity of correlation-like measures, such
studies may have misinterpreted results in terms of brain interaction change. The ability to
accurately interpret observed differences will be important moving forward, given the ultimate
neuroscientific goal of increasing mechanistic understanding of brain processes (rather than,
e.g., simply identifying ambiguous group differences).
To further illustrate the difficulty of interpreting changes in correlation-like measures,
consider the possible range of distinct interpretations (as established by the simulations above)

of an observed increase in correlation between two regions’ time series: (1) decreased
independent activity in region X and/or Y, (2) decreased interaction between Y and another
region Z resulting in less unshared signal in region Y (Figure 2), (3) increased interaction
between X and Y. Covariance is also problematic, though less so, as an increase in covariance
would have only two viable interpretations: (1) increased interaction between X and Y, or (2)
increased overall variance/power in either X and/or Y. In contrast, an increase in the covariance
conjunction measure (combining correlation and covariance) would have only a single viable
interpretation: increased interaction between X and Y.
Correlations have been historically favored over covariance in many scientific
applications because correlations are normalized by variance, making them insensitive to
changes in scale and facilitating comparison across studies. These constitute major advantages
in some cases, but we found that normalization by variance has unintended consequences
when estimating functional connectivity differences. Rather than simply estimating change in an
abstract measure of association, differences in correlation can be driven by changes in the
unshared variance component, such that the very aspect we are trying to “control for” (the
overall variance) actually drives the measured effect. This is not an issue only for correlation,
but any measure that normalizes by some form of variance (or entropy), such as coherence,
regression, and mutual information (Figure 4). We found that simply removing variance
normalization from correlation (i.e., using covariance) circumvented these issues. We suggest
that removing variance normalization from other measures may help solve this problem in other
cases when estimating connectivity change (see Results for preliminary evidence with
coherence). Such measures without variance normalization could then be combined with the
original measures to allow implementation of the covariance conjunction approach – ruling out
spurious changes in functional connectivity due to either changes in unshared variance or
overall variance/power.

As outlined above, there are several issues to consider when using covariance. First,
since covariance is sensitive to changes in scale, care should be taken to ensure no scale shifts
have occurred across conditions/groups/individuals that are being compared. Note, however,
that this same issue is often present when comparing brain activity magnitudes across
conditions/groups/individuals, such that this issue may be no worse here than in most existing
neuroscientific studies of brain function (which have tended to test for activation magnitude
changes rather than functional connectivity changes). Our recommendation is to sidestep this
issue using the conservative “covariance conjunction” approach (Figure 3).
Another potential issue with covariance is its non-standard units: each covariance
estimate is in units of region X activity * region Y activity. This reflects the non-normalized
nature of covariance relative to correlation. This is not an issue in the case of functional
connectivity change for a given pair of regions since the compared conditions/groups/individuals
always have the same units (i.e., region X activity * region Y activity). This is problematic for
performing across-connection comparisons, however, just as across-region activity comparisons
are problematic with some methods (e.g., fMRI (Handwerker et al. 2004)) due to potential
differences in activation scale across regions. However, we found that covariances could be

t

normalized at the group level (using inter-subject variance) with t-tests, which eliminated scale
differences across covariances (Figure 6). Note that having distinct units across connections
may be an issue for some graph theoretical (Bullmore and Bassett 2011) analyses (especially at
the single-subject level) that focus on network topology (e.g., community detection) but
potentially not for others (e.g., degree centrality).
Using covariance does not eliminate all issues present when using correlation-like
measures to estimate functional connectivity change. For instance, like correlations (Smith et al.
2011b), covariances do not estimate directionality of functional connectivity changes. It will be
important to determine which of the existing directional/effective connectivity methods (Friston et
al. 2003; Roebroeck et al. 2005; Nolte et al. 2008; Ramsey et al. 2011; Smith et al. 2011b)
involve variance normalization, and if all of them do, then it will be important to develop new
approaches that do not involve this analysis step for studies examining effective connectivity
change. Importantly, there is already evidence of advantages when using an unnormalized
version of a popular form of effective connectivity, Granger causality (Angelini et al. 2010;
Stramaglia et al. 2015).
Another limitation is that, like correlations and most other functional connectivity
measures (Smith et al. 2011b), covariances do not indicate if two regions are interacting directly
or indirectly via a third (or fourth, fifth, etc.) region(s). This affects interpretation, but is often not
problematic as long as it is taken into account. It may be possible, however, to estimate direct
functional connectivity change using some form of partial correlation (or multiple regression)
(Marrelec et al. 2006; Liang et al. 2011; Smith et al. 2011b; Ryali et al. 2012). It is important to
note that partial correlation involves variance normalization and therefore faces limitations
similar to standard correlations with respect to changes in unshared variance. Also note that,
despite its name, inverse covariance also involves variance normalization. In the future it may
be useful to identify partial correlation-like approaches that are adapted to not include variancebased normalization. One promising possibility is to use multivariate Granger causality without
variance-based normalization (Angelini et al. 2010; Stramaglia et al. 2015), which estimates all
time series simultaneously to achieve the main benefits of partial correlation in the context of
directional connectivity. Note, however, that potential issues with using Granger causality with
fMRI have been identified (Smith et al. 2011a; 2011b), such that this approach may be best
applied to other modalities such as EEG. The inability to infer whether two regions are
interacting directly notwithstanding, the present results suggest using covariances provides
increased confidence that a change in connectivity between two regions reflects their shared
signal change (irrespective of whether this occurred via a 3rd region; see Figure 2).
We recommend the use of covariance conjunction, in which the results of correlation and
covariance analyses are combined, in order to remain conservative. This combines the benefits
of both correlation (insensitivity to overall variance scaling) and covariance (insensitivity to
changes in unshared variance) in terms of reducing Type I errors (false positives). However, as
illustrated in Figures 4 and 5, this comes with the possibility of increased Type II errors (false
negatives). For instance, a real increase in interaction may be accompanied by increases in
independent processing in each tested region (unshared signal), resulting in an increase in
covariance but not correlation. This would lead to a false negative when using the conjunction
approach. We nonetheless recommend this approach given the possibility that an increase in
both shared and unshared signal may also reflect an overall variance increase. It will be

important for future work to look for ways to maintain all the benefits of covariance without its
potential drawbacks.
We found that, in contrast to functional connectivity changes, correlations may be better
for detecting the absolute presence of functional connections relative to zero. This supports the
use of correlations to detect the absolute presence of functional connectivity, as performed by
many resting-state functional connectivity studies (Biswal et al. 1995; Power et al. 2011; Yeo et
al. 2011). Importantly, however, we reached the opposite conclusion in the case of detecting
functional connectivity change.

We specifically focused on functional connectivity differences between an emotion task
and rest (Figure 7A), identifying numerous differences between the measures. There were
similarities between the methods as well, however. For instance, there were within-network
decreases for motor, auditory, and visual systems across both methods, consistent with recent
findings (Cole et al. 2014). Notably, these decreases were more robust when using covariance,
even extending the within-network decreases to other systems. This suggests that such withinnetwork decreases in functional connectivity are either more widespread than indicated by
correlations or, alternatively, that these decreases are largely due to decreases in overall
variance/power. It will be important for future research to investigate the possible mechanisms
underlying such widespread within-network decreased covariance. One possible interpretation
is that task-focused attention (“cognitive set”) (Duncan 2013) requires reduced interactions
within most brain systems to facilitate selection of task-relevant regional interactions, possibly
including primarily inter-system interactions (e.g., visual-to-motor system interactions in a visualmotor task). This possibility is consistent with our recent study demonstrating extensive intersystem interaction changes across a variety of tasks (Cole et al. 2013). Note that in addition to
using correlation and PPI we also found those effects using covariance differences (see that
paper’s supplementary results) (Cole et al. 2013).
There is growing interest in establishing functional connectivity differences across
different groups and clinical states to characterize dysfunctional neural dynamics. Functional
connectivity has become a particularly powerful and widely used approach to characterize largescale neural dynamics in severe neuropsychiatric illnesses such as schizophrenia (Anticevic et
al. 2013; 2014). Use of correlation in such cases could be problematic for the same reasons
articulated above: correlation differences can be driven by changes in unshared signal in one
group relative to another, resulting in false positives or false negatives. To provide evidence for
this, we examined functional connectivity differences between patients diagnosed with chronic
schizophrenia and healthy controls. We focused on two well-characterized systems with known
disruptions in schizophrenia (Baker et al. 2014): DMN and FPCN. As predicted, we found that
covariance revealed a connectivity alteration in patients relative to controls that was not evident
when using correlations – consistent with our network simulations and demonstrating that
covariance can reveal a distinct set of functional connectivity differences from correlation in a
clinical context.

We have demonstrated the complexity of interpreting changes in correlation (and a
variety of other measures), and the relatively improved clarity of interpreting changes in
covariance. This suggests covariance may be preferred when testing for brain interaction
changes. Despite this, caution suggests the use of more typical functional connectivity
measures in addition to covariance. As outlined above (Figure 3 and Figure 8), one possibility
would be to conduct both correlation and covariance analyses, assigning the most confidence to
results that are consistent across both approaches. In addition, there may be cases in which
correlation is more sensitive than covariance, such as when each subject’s data are scaled
differently. In such cases there would be additional irrelevant inter-subject variance that would
reduce statistical confidence in effects of interest. In cases where within-subject manipulations
are used, subtracting covariances prior to the group analysis (as in a paired t-test) can reduce
such inter-subject variance concerns. Alternatively, after subtracting covariances at the single
subject level the resulting difference can then be divided by the standard deviation (aggregate
across both conditions) to rescale the result prior to group analysis. Finally, it may be possible in
some cases to rescale time series based on the time series mean – a percent signal change
normalization approach often used with fMRI that is unlikely to be biased by changes in
unshared variance.
Conclusion

We used mathematical and biologically realistic simulations to arrive at a theoretically
important conclusion: variance normalization (as performed by most commonly used measures)
can obscure estimates of functional connectivity change. This applies primarily to cases that
involve unshared signal alterations, though even cases without such alterations are obscured
for the investigator due to uncertainty whether such unshared signal alteration occurred (e.g., in
Figure 7A decreased correlations were only interpretable due to similar decreases in
covariance). This theoretical insight, corroborated by empirical evidence, has implications for a
wide variety of previous and future studies, as estimating functional connectivity change is
central to understanding the functional relevance of brain connections (by associating them with
task conditions, individual differences, and group differences) and for characterizing brain
connectivity dynamics. Removing variance normalization from other measures may similarly
improve clarity in other context as well (e.g., lag-invariant functional connectivity using
coherence). Generally, these findings suggest a need to reconceptualize functional connectivity
change in terms of shared signal differences, rather than in terms of abstract measures of
association that may obscure effects of interest.
