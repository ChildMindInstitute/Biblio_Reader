• Fourier series can be used to model the low-frequency fluctuations in
resting-state fMRI.
• The usage of Fourier series enables the application of DCM to study
resting-state network structures.
• Modulations of the IPL to the MPFC and PCC are right lateralized.

• The model with the best evidence is shown in Fig 5.
• The connectivity from the right IPL to the MPFC and PCC were
greater than the connectivity from the left IPL (F(1,62) = 7.251, MSE
= 0.011, p = 0.009).

• Resting-state data of 64 subjects from the 1000 Functional
Connectomes Project was analyzed
(http://fcon_1000.projects.nitrc.org/) (21 male, mean age 21.2 years)5.
• 230 images were acquired for each subject using a TR of 2s. Scanning
parameters can be found in the project website.
• Preprocessing using SPM8 included motion correction, spatial
normalization of the functional images via normalizing the anatomical
image, and spatial smoothing using an 8mm Gaussian kernel.
• Spatial independent component analysis was conducted to define the
DMN using GIFT6.

• For a given periodic function such as lowfrequency fluctuation, it can be approximated
by the sum of a set of sine and cosine
periodic functions, which is called Fourier
series (Fig 1).
• The Fourier series (binarized) can be
implemented in the general linear model to
capture the low-frequency fluctuations in the
resting-state (Fig 2).

• DCM models included four ROIs (the green circles in Fig 3A).
• Eight Fourier series were set as inputs (C parameter) for all the four
ROIs.

Dynamic causal modeling of the default mode network (DMN)

• The regions whose variance can be highly captured by the Fourier
series regressors resemble the default mode network (DMN) (Fig 3B).
It overlapped with the DMN map obtained using an independent
component analysis (ICA) (Fig 3A & 3C).

• The four ROIs of the DMN were the medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC)
(centered at 3, 54, -2), posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) (0, -52 26),
left inferior parietal lobule (LIPL) (-50, -63, 32), and right IPL (RIPL)
(48, -69, 35) (green circles in Fig 1A).

• There is a growing interest to study brain network structures using
dynamic causal modeling (DCM)1 in resting-state fMRI data.
• It was suggested to model the spontaneous fluctuations as stochastic
processes2. However, we suggest to explicitly model the lowfrequency fluctuation signals using Fourier series.
• We aimed to use Fourier series to model the input of DCM, and study
the network structure underlying the default mode network (DMN)3, 4.
