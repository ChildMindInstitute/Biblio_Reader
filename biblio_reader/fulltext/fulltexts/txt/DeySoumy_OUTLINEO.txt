In this dissertation we aim to solve the problem of automatic diagnosis of the Attention Deficit Hyperactive Disorder (ADHD) affected subjects using their resting
state functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (rs-fMRI) data of brain. The problem
is of importance as around 5-10% of the children all over the world are diagnosed
with ADHD. In our approach, we model the functions of a brain as a connectivity
network, which is expected to capture the information about how synchronous
different brain regions are in terms of their functional activities.
We developed a simple method employing the Bag-of-Words (BoW) framework
for the classification of the ADHD subjects. We represent each node in the connectivity network by a 4-D feature vector: 3-D location and the node degree. The final
BoW representation of each subject is a histogram of node representations. The
method is able to achieve 64% classification accuracy on the ADHD-200 data set.
However, one major shortcoming of this approach is the use of features from the
whole brain, which may not contain useful information.
In order to address the above shortcoming, we hypothesize that only a subset of the
nodes of the network possesses important information. To identify the important
nodes of the network, we developed a novel algorithm, which generates different
random subset of nodes each time extracting the features from a subset to compute
the feature vectors and perform classification. The subsets are then ranked based on
the classification accuracy and the occurrences of each node in the top ranked subsets are measured. We improved the classification accuracy to 69.59% using this
approach. One limitation of the approach is that the network features, which are
computed for each node of the network, capture only the local structures ignoring
the global topology of the network. Also, our method represents each voxel as a
node which makes the node count of the network several thousand and increase the
computational cost.
Next, in order to capture the global structure of the networks, we use MultiDimensional Scaling (MDS) technique to project all the subjects from an unknown
network-space to a low dimensional space based on their inter-network distance
measures. To reduce the network computation cost, the nodes of the network are
constructed from clusters of highly active functionally homogeneous voxels which
help to preserve the maximum relevant information with minimum redundancy.
We achieve impressive classification accuracy (73.55%) using this method.
Finally, unlike our approach so far, we explored if structural brain images contain
any useful information related to the diagnosis problem. Towards this end, we developed a new method to combine the information of structural and functional
brain images in a late fusion framework. For structural data we use gray matter
(GM) images of brain to input in a convolutional neural network (CNN). For the
functional data we compute the average power of each voxel based on its fMRI
time series. We achieve an accuracy of 79.14% using combined information.
