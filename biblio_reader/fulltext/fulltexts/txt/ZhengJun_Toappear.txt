Abstract
Evidence points to a crucial role for altered neural oscillations and synchrony in the
pathophysiology of schizophrenia. Previous resting state functional magnetic
resonance imaging (fMRI) studies found aberrant amplitudes of low-frequency
oscillations in adult patients with schizophrenia. Whether the abnormality is also

Abstract
present in adolescents with early-onset schizophrenia (EOS) is largely unknown. We
recruited 39 adolescents with a first episode of EOS and 31 age- and educationmatched healthy controls. Resting state fMRI was obtained using an echo-planar
imaging sequence. Voxel-wise amplitude of low-frequency (0.01–0.08 Hz)
ﬂuctuations (ALFF) was compared between groups. We investigated seed-based
functional connectivity between significantly disturbed ALFF regions and whole brain
voxels in all participants. EOS participants exhibited significantly increased ALFF
values in the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and decreased ALFF in the ventral precuneus
compared with controls. Decreased ALFF values in the precuneus of EOS showed a
significant negative correlation with negative symptom scores on the Positive and
Negative Syndrome Scale. Disturbed functional connectivity mainly occurred
between the orbitofrontal cortex and the temporal cortex in EOS. These ﬁndings
demonstrate abnormal spontaneous neuronal activity and functional connectivity in
the frontal and parietal cortex of EOS. Aberrant ALFF in the precuneus might be a
biomarker of EOS.

1. Introduction

Schizophrenia is a neurodevelopmental disorder in which psychotic symptoms, in
most cases, emerge in late adolescence or early adulthood between the ages of 18 and
25 years (Feinberg, 1982-83; Lewis and Levitt, 2002a). Previous research speculates
that the early onset of schizophrenia during adolescence or even before adolescence is
associated with severe impairments and that schizophrenia might be a consequence of
an exaggeration of typical synaptic pruning during adolescence (Feinberg, 1982-83;
Paus et al., 2008). In recent years, a dysfunction in the synchronization of neural
oscillations has been identified as a potential mechanism to explain cognitive
dysfunctions and certain symptoms of schizophrenia (Uhlhaas and Singer, 2010).
Aberrant neural oscillations during early critical periods may lead to imprecise
temporal coordination of neural activity and result in pathological modifications of
cortical circuits (Hebb, 2005; Uhlhaas and Singer, 2010). Thus, it is important to
know if neural synchrony is involved in the aberrant development of cortical networks
in schizophrenia and if the disrupted spontaneous neuronal activity is correlated with
clinical symptoms in adolescent patients with early-onset schizophrenia (EOS).

Brain oscillatory modulations have been investigated with blood oxygen
level-dependent (BOLD) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) signals (Zuo
et al., 2010). Functional MRI studies have revealed that spontaneous low-frequency
(<0.1 Hz) oscillations (LFOs) reflect coherent networks in the somatosensory, visual,

Text
and language-processing regions of the brain (Biswal et al., 1995; Hampson et al.,
2002; van de Ven et al., 2004) and that gray matter exhibits a higher amplitude of
LFOs than white matter (Biswal et al., 1995). In particular, the amplitude of LFOs
measured as the amplitude of low-frequency ﬂuctuations (ALFF) and fractional ALFF
(Yang et al., 2007; Yu-Feng et al., 2007; Zou et al., 2008) has been applied as a
measure of mental illness-related regional spontaneous neuronal disturbances in such
conditions as attention-deﬁcit hyperactivity disorder (Yu-Feng et al., 2007), mesial
temporal lobe epilepsy (Zhang et al., 2010), major depressive disorder (Liu et al.,
2013), amnestic mild cognitive impairment (Han et al., 2011), and schizophrenia
(Hoptman et al., 2010). Hoptman et al. reported decreased ALFF values in the lingual
gyrus, cuneus, and precuneus of adult patients with schizophrenia and increased
values in the left parahippocampal gyrus in the same patients (Hoptman et al., 2010).
Huang et al. found that ALFF values are significantly decreased in the medial
prefrontal lobe (MPFC) and increased in the left and right putamen in treatment-naïve,
ﬁrst-episode schizophrenia patients; they opined that regional ALFF is altered in early
stages of the disorder (Huang et al., 2010). Studying drug-naïve patients with
first-episode psychosis is a useful approach to understanding the pathogenesis of
psychosis because young patients are comparatively free of the confounding effects of
environmental factors such as substance abuse, disease chronicity, education years,
and treatment effects. Under the assumption that schizophrenia is a neurodevelopment
disorder, researchers have hypothesized that local regional disturbed ALFF in the
cerebral cortex might occur as a neurodevelopmental anomaly in adolescent patients

Text
with schizophrenia (Feinberg, 1982-83; Lewis and Levitt, 2002b). Whether the
regional brain functional abnormality in adolescent patients with early-onset
schizophrenia is similar to that of adult patients remains unknown. Investigation of
the alterations in ALFF in EOS may enrich our understanding of the
pathophysiological development and the mechanisms underlying schizophrenia.

MRI studies have revealed brain functional abnormalities in patients with EOS.
Previous fMRI studies have found aberrant brain networks and modularity, especially
in the default mode network (DMN), in young schizophrenia patients
(Alexander-Bloch et al., 2010; Tang et al., 2013). These findings suggest that both
local regional abnormalities and aberrations in inter-regional connectivity might be
present in EOS. Recent findings on the association between ALFF and functional
connectivity in a resting state brain network have been presented (Di et al., 2013). A
disrupted correlation between local functional abnormalities and aberrations in
inter-regional connectivity in schizophrenia has been reported (Zalesky et al., 2012;
Yu et al., 2013). Thus, we attempt to identify both ALFF abnormalities in local brain
regions and seed-based functional connectivity across brain networks in EOS.

In this study, an exploratory voxel-wise analysis of ALFF (0.01-0.08 Hz) ﬂuctuations
was conducted in antipsychotic-naive patients with first-episode schizophrenia and in
age-matched healthy controls. All of the participants were 12 to 18 years old. ALFF
was measured with resting state fMRI to investigate possible early disruption of LFOs

Text
and to explore any associations with clinical symptoms in patients with EOS.
Additionally, a seed-based voxel-wise functional connectivity analysis was conducted
between the disturbed ALFF regions and whole brain voxels to investigate
inter-regional connectivity abnormalities in EOS.

2. Methods

2.1. Subjects
In this study, all participants were right-handed, of Han Chinese ethnicity, aged 13 to
18 years old. All of them had more than 6 years of formal education. Thirty-nine
adolescent patients with first-episode schizophrenia were recruited from the
consecutive admissions at the Second Affiliated Hospital of Xinxiang Medical
University. They met the following additional inclusion criteria: (1) DSM-IV-TR
criteria for schizophrenia (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders,
fourth edition, text revision, American Psychiatric Association, 2000); (2) no
co-morbid Axis I diagnosis; (3) duration of illness less than 2 years; (4)
antipsychotic-naive. Schizophrenia was independently diagnosed by two well-trained
psychiatrists based on the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV-TR, patient
version (SCID-I/P). Patients were interviewed again 6 months later to confirm a final
diagnosis of schizophrenia. Psychopathology was assessed in patients with the
Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS). A total of 31 age-, gender-,
education- and IQ-matched healthy adolescents were recruited from the local
community through advertisements. The healthy adolescents were screened with

Text
structured interviews based on the Chinese version of the SCID to rule out individuals
who had any history of psychiatric or medical conditions. All participants were
excluded if they had (1) any past or current neurological disorders or family history of
hereditary neurological disorders; (2) a history of head injury resulting in loss of
consciousness; (3) alcohol or substance abuse; (4) claustrophobia; (5) incompatible
implants (exclusion criterion for MRI). The study was approved by the Ethics
Committee of the Second Affiliated Hospital of Xinxiang Medical University. Clinical
and demographic data are presented in Table 1.

2.2. Data acquisition
Imaging was performed on a 3.0 T Siemens Vision Scanner (Erlangen, Germany)
equipped with high-speed gradients on the day that subjects were recruited. The
following parameters were used for T1 anatomical imaging axially: repetition
time/echo time (TR/TE) = 2530/2.43 ms, 256×256 matrix, 7° ﬂip angle, voxel size
=1×1×1 mm3, 158 slices without inter-slice gap. At the same locations to anatomical
slices, functional images were acquired by using an echo-planar imaging sequence
with the following parameters: TR/TE=2000/30 ms, 33 slices, 64×64 matrix, 90° ﬂip
angle, field of view = 220×220 mm2, inter-slice gap = 0.6 mm, voxel size =
3.44×3.44×4mm3 . For each participant, the fMRI scan lasted for 6 min, and 240
volumes were obtained.

2.3.1. Data preprocessing

Text
Functional image preprocessing was carried out using the DPARSF
(http://www.restfmri.net) (Chao-Gan and Yu-Feng, 2010) and SPM8
(http://www..fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm) toolkits. The first 10 functional volumes were
discarded as signal equilibrium and subjects’ adaptation to scanning noise. We
corrected the remaining images for temporal differences and head motion. We also
calculated individuals’ mean frame-wise displacement (FD) by the translation and
rotation parameters of head motion according to a previously described formula (Liu
et al., 2008; Power et al., 2012) and evaluated group differences. We then warped the
functional images into a standard stereotaxic space at a 3×3×3 mm3 resolution, using
the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) echo-planar imaging template, and then we
spatially smoothed images with a 6-mm full-width at half-maximum (FWHM)
isotropic Gaussian kernel. Finally, we removed linear trends from time courses and
for temporal band-pass filtering (0.01–0.08 Hz).

2.3.2. ALFF analysis
We used ALFF to characterize amplitude measures at each voxel (Yu-Feng et al.,
2007). The time series for each voxel was transformed to the frequency domain using
a Fast Fourier Transform, and the power spectrum was then obtained. Since the power
of a given frequency was proportional to the square of the amplitude of this frequency
component, the square root was calculated at each frequency of the power spectrum
and the averaged square root was obtained across 0.01–0.08 Hz at each voxel. This
averaged square root was taken as the ALFF value. The ALFF value of each voxel

Text
was standardized by dividing the full-brain mean ALFF values. Then the whole brain
voxel-wise ALFF was calculated in each participant in both the EOS and healthy
control groups. Two-sample t-tests were used to compare the differences in ALFF
between groups and the AlphaSim-corrected significance level of p < 0.05 was
obtained for clusters with a minimum of 134 voxels and an individual voxel height
threshold of p < 0.01(Meyer-Lindenberg, 2011). Corrections were confined within a
whole brain mask and determined by Monte Carlo simulations. This process was
performed by a plug-in implemented in REST software (http://www.restfmri.net)
(Zang et al., 2012). We also investigated the relationship of abnormal LFOs in brain
regions of patients with EOS and their clinical symptoms. We extracted the mean
ALFF values in the disturbed regions of individuals with EOS and calculated the
linear Pearson correlation coefficient between regional ALFF values and the PANSS
scores of patients.

2.3.3. Functional connectivity analysis
Seed-based functional connectivity was then performed in our study. Regions
showing significantly altered ALFFs were defined as seed regions of interest (ROIs)
for subsequent functional connectivity analysis. The averaged time course was
obtained from the ROI and correlational analysis was performed in a voxel-wise way
to generate a functional connectivity map. In addition, six motion parameters, the
cerebrospinal fluid, and the white matter signals were removed as nuisance variables
to reduce the effects of head motion and non-neuronal BOLD fluctuations. Then,

Text
two-sample t-tests were performed to assess between-group difference and the cluster
correction. An AlphaSim-corrected significance level of p < 0.05 was obtained for
clusters with an individual voxel height threshold of p < 0.01 and a cluster threshold
of p < 0.05.

3. Results

3.1. Demographic and clinical characteristics of the participants
Four patients and one healthy control were eliminated from the study because of head
movement. A total of 35 patients and 30 healthy controls completed the study. The
patients with EOS and the controls did not significantly differ in age (t = 0.40, p =
0.68), gender (ϰ 2 = 0.74, p = 0.39), or years of education (t = 0.51, p = 0.61) (Table 1).
The individual FDs were not significantly different (t = 0.33, p = 0.73) between the
EOS (mean±SD: 0.097±0.027) and healthy control (mean±SD: 0.094±0.047) groups.

3.2. ALFF group differences
Compared with the healthy controls, the adolescents with EOS showed a significantly
increased ALFF in the bilateral orbitofrontal cortex (p < 0.05, AlphaSim-corrected)
and a significantly decreased ALFF in the ventral precuneus (p < 0.05,
AlphaSim-corrected) (Table 2 and Fig. 1).

3.3. Correlations between ALFF and clinical characteristics
The linear Pearson correlation between disturbed regional ALFF values and PANSS
scores in patients with EOS was calculated. ALFF in the precuneus had a significant
negative correlation with PANSS negative symptom scores (r = -0.44, p = 0.0067)
(Fig. 1) and tended to correlate with PANSS general psychopathology scores (r =

Text
-0.39, p = 0.022) and PANSS total scores (r = -0.38, p = 0.023) in patients with EOS
(Fig. 1). No significant correlation was found between disturbed ALFF in the
orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and clinical symptoms, as indicated by PANSS scores, in
patients with EOS.

3.4. Seed-based functional connectivity abnormality in EOS
Ventral precuneus seed-based functional connectivity was reduced relative to control
values in the dorsal precuneus and the mid-cingulate cortex (MCC) in EOS patients (p
< 0.05, AlphaSim-corrected) (Table 3). Left OFC functional connectivity was reduced
in the bilateral superior temporal gyrus, bilateral postcentral gyrus, left middle
temporal gyrus, and right temporal pole (p < 0.05, AlphaSim-corrected) (Table 3).
Right OFC functional connectivity was also reduced in the bilateral superior temporal
gyrus, bilateral temporal pole, and bilateral insula in EOS patients (p < 0.05,
AlphaSim-corrected) (Table 3 and Fig. 2).

4. Discussion

We investigated ALFF with data obtained from BOLD-fMRI and noted a functional
brain abnormality in adolescents with EOS. Aberrant ALFF was initially observed in
treatment-naive adolescent patients with first-episode schizophrenia. Additionally, we
found that decreased ALFF is significantly correlated to the clinical symptoms of EOS
patients and could serve as a potential biomarker of EOS.

Recent evidence from electrophysiological, physiological, and anatomical studies
suggests that abnormalities in the synchronized oscillatory activity of neurons may
have a critical role in the neurodevelopment of schizophrenia (Uhlhaas and Singer,
2010). Resting state fMRI studies indicate that the ALFF of BOLD signals may
represent a potentially meaningful and stable property of the brain (Zuo et al., 2010).
ALFF was measured to identify abnormalities in baseline brain activity in a number
of different mental disorders in recent years (Yu-Feng et al., 2007; Hoptman et al.,
2010; Zhang et al., 2010; Di Martino et al., 2014). Previous findings on ALFF
abnormalities in patients with schizophrenia suggested spontaneous brain functional
deficits in frontal and occipital regions (Hoptman et al., 2010; Huang et al., 2010).
The inconsistent locations of disturbed ALFF in previous studies on schizophrenia
could be due to differences in the studied populations, such as differences in symptom
severity and illness duration. In the current study, we attempted to identify ALFF

Text
abnormalities in treatment-naïve adolescent patients with EOS. Our findings illustrate
that low-frequency oscillation abnormalities might be present in the prefrontal and
pariatal cortex in EOS patients. The study of patients with untreated first-episode
schizophrenia is especially useful in understanding disorder-related clinical and
neurophysiological brain functional changes (Lui et al., 2009). Several studies have
reported abnormalities in the amplitude and phase of gamma-band oscillations, which
might suggest that dysfunctions in neural oscillations and synchronization are present
at the early phase of illness (Symond et al., 2005; Spencer et al., 2008; Uhlhaas and
Singer, 2010). Our findings reveal that low-frequency (<0.1 Hz) oscillation
abnormalities occur in adolescent patients with early-stage schizophrenia. Moreover,
abnormal neural oscillations and synchrony, related to late maturation and the
restructuring of brain functional networks, are important to the emergence of
psychosis (Uhlhaas et al., 2009). The findings of ALFF abnormalities in EOS in our
study might be linked to the neurodevelopmental pathogenesis of schizophrenia.

In the present study, a significant decrease in ALFF was observed in the ventral
precuneus (PCu) of patients with EOS. This finding is in line with that of Hoptman et
al. (Hoptman et al., 2010) and a recent multi-site resting state fMRI study on ALFF in
schizophrenia (Turner et al., 2013). Moreover, this finding on decreased ALFF in the
PCu of treatment-naïve patients with schizophrenia reinforces previous findings by
eliminating the effect of medication on findings; the reduced ALFF in the PCu might
be a feature of the continuous course of schizophrenia. The PCu, which is a part of the

Text
structural core of the human cortex (Hagmann et al., 2008) and forms part of the
so-called “rich club” organization in the brain network (i.e., "a tendency for
high-degree nodes to be more densely connected among themselves than nodes of a
lower degree"; van den Heuvel and Sporns, 2011), also plays a central role in the
default mode network (Utevsky et al., 2014). Precuneus-involved rich club
connectivity was found to decrease in both psychotic patients and their siblings,
suggesting that the structural connections of the PCu are more likely affected by
genetic factors of schizophrenia (Collin et al., 2014). The functional aspect of the PCu
was found to be involved in visuo-spatial imagery, episodic memory retrieval, and
self-processing operations (Cavanna and Trimble, 2006a; Cavanna and Trimble,
2006b). An fMRI study has also found decreased neural activities in the posterior
cingulate cortex and the PCu in schizophrenia patients during self- and other-refection
processing operations (van der Meer et al., 2013). Thus, our finding suggests that
aberrancies in intrinsic brain function might be a potential disease-related mechanism
of schizophrenia and may affect facets of patients’ cognitive functions.

Decreased ALFF values in the PCu of EOS patients had a significant negative
correlation with scores on the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS). In this
study, we performed 12 linear Pearson correlation tests between ALFF values of three
ROIs and four lists of PANSS scores in the EOS patients. The significant correlations
between PANSS on clinical symptoms did not survive the Bonferroni correction for
multiple comparisons (p < 0.05). A potential factor was the small sample size, a

Text
drawback of our study. Although not significant after Bonferroni correction, the
correlation between decreased ALFF values and PANSS scores is suggestive and
should be tested further in larger numbers of patients. The strongest correlation was
with negative symptoms. The negative schizophrenic syndrome includes affective
flattening, alogia, avolition, anhedonia, and attentional impairment (Kay et al., 1987).
Abnormal decision making and emotional processing were recently found to be
associated with negative symptoms of schizophrenia (Gold et al., 2013; Oorschot et
al., 2013), and a cerebral blood ﬂow abnormality in the cingulate cortex was reported
to be associated with PANSS negative scores in ﬁrst-episode schizophrenia (Ashton et
al., 2000). The functional connectivity between the posterior cingulate and the frontal
and temporal gyri was correlated with PANSS negative scores in schizophrenia; this
finding suggests that abnormal default mode network activity is involved in the
psychotic symptoms of patients with schizophrenia (Bluhm et al., 2007). Our finding
that ALFF abnormalities in the PCu of EOS patients are correlated with PANSS
negative symptoms provides evidence that the functional abnormality of the default
mode network is associated with the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. This
functional deficit in the PCu might be a potential biomarker of patients with
schizophrenia during adolescence.

We also observed functional hyperactivity in the bilateral OFC in EOS patients
compared with healthy controls. The OFC is involved in sensory integration,
representation of the affective value of the reinforcer, and decision making and

Text
expectation (Kringelbach, 2005). Regional cerebral blood flow in the OFC was
reduced in patients with schizophrenia, especially in deficit syndrome groups. This
result suggests that the OFC plays an important role in the development of severe
negative symptoms in patients with schizophrenia (Kanahara et al., 2013). Previous
fMRI research found decreased ALFF values in the orbital/medial frontal lobe in adult
patients with first-episode schizophrenia (Huang et al., 2010). In the current study,
increased ALFF in the frontal lobe of EOS patients was located in the lateral OFC.
This finding does not contradict those of previous research. Actually, the medial and
lateral orbitofrontal cortices perform different brain functions in sensory integration.
The former is related to the monitoring, learning, and memory of the reward value of
reinforcers; the latter is related to behavioral influences (Kringelbach and Rolls, 2004).
Adolescents are more prone to exhibit risk-taking behaviors than adults (Steinberg,
2004). Researchers speculate that adolescent patients with schizophrenia might
present higher rates of substance use compared with the general population because of
decision-making impairment (Kester et al., 2006). Thus, the abnormal ALFF in OFC
might potentially be a characteristic brain functional deficit in adolescent patients
with schizophrenia. Whether the increased ALFF in the lateral OFC of EOS patients is
related to hypersensitivity to reward in adolescent patients with schizophrenia should
be investigated in future studies.

In the current study, reduced functional connectivity of the OFC was observed in the
temporal lobe and insula of EOS patients. Recent research has demonstrated that

Text
impaired insight is related to brain activation during self-reflection in the insula,
inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), and temporo-parietal junction, angular gyrus, inferior
parietal lobule (IPL) regions in schizophrenia (van der Meer et al., 2013). Previous
research on the brain network has also revealed that frontal and temporal cortex
structural connectivity is altered in schizophrenia (van den Heuvel et al., 2010).
Frontotemporal functional connectivity involving auditory and cognitive tasks is
likewise disrupted in schizophrenia (Lawrie et al., 2002; Ragland et al., 2004). The
structural connection of the frontotemporal connection is possibly weakened because
of the focal reductions in myelin in schizophrenia (Mandl et al., 2010). The
abnormalities in the OFC functional connections in the superior temporal gyrus,
temporal pole, and middle temporal gyrus in EOS patients observed in the current
study suggest that the frontotemporal connection is disrupted in the early stage of
schizophrenia.

The present study has several limitations. The first one is the low statistical power of
identifying brain functional disturbed regions in a case-control study. Owing to the
scarcity of EOS patients and small sample sizes of adolescent participants, we could
not achieve the most powerful results. We applied cluster correction on the voxel-wise
statistical results to obtain clustered brain functional abnormal regions in EOS, and
the post hoc correlation analysis of clinical symptoms with ALFF was performed as
an exploratory test of potential positive results. The second limitation is that we did
not record physiological signals, such as cardiac pulsation. Indeed, the effect of

Text
regression is strong on ALFF for individuals, but previous research has shown that it
has no notable effect on comparisons between patients with schizophrenia and
controls (Turner et al., 2013). Third, a longitudinal study is necessary to establish
whether altered neural activities in patients relate to a common neurobiological
process in schizophrenia or whether they are independent of the disease. Moreover,
the genetic risk of disrupted neural oscillations and synchrony in the PCu should be
identified to learn more about the neurodevelopment of adolescent psychotic patients
and the etiology of schizophrenia.

In summary, this study investigated aberrant ALFF (0.01–0.08 Hz) ﬂuctuations in
first-episode adolescents with EOS. We found increased ALFF in the OFC and
decreased ALFF in the PCu in patients with EOS; the decreased ALFF in the PCu was
found to be correlated to the clinical negative symptoms of patients.

Highlights


We obtained resting-state fMRI images of adolescent patients with early onset schizophrenia (EOS) and
healthy controls to compare the amplitude of low-frequency ﬂuctuations (ALFF) between groups.



We found increased ALFF in orbitofrontal cortex and decreased ALFF in precuneus of EOS.



We also found decreased ALFF value of precuneus in EOS was significantly negative correlated with Positive
and Negative Symptom Scale (PANSS) scores of patients.



The reduced functional connectivity in disturbed ALFF regions was also found in patients with EOS.
