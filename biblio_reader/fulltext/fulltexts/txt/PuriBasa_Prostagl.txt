Concerns about growth retardation and unknown effects on long-term brain development with stimulants
have prompted interest in polyunsaturated fatty acid supplementation (PUFA) as an alternative treatment.
However, randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and meta-analyses of PUFA supplementation in ADHD have
shown marginal beneﬁt, and uncertainty exists as to which, if any, PUFA might be effective in alleviating
symptoms of ADHD. We conducted an updated meta-analysis of RCTs in ADHD together with multivariable
meta-regression analyses using data on PUFA content obtained from independent fatty acid methyl ester
analyses of each study PUFA regimen. The PubMed, Embase and PsycINFO databases were searched with no
start date and up to 28th July 2013. Study inclusion criteria were: randomized design, placebo controlled, PUFA
preparation as active intervention, reporting change scores on ADHD rating-scale measures. Rating-scale
measures of inattention and hyperactive-impulsive symptoms were extracted, study authors were contacted to
obtain missing data, studies not reporting negative ﬁndings had these data imputed, and study quality was
assessed using the Jadad system plus other indicators. Random-effects models were used for pooled effects and
for meta-regression analyses. Standardized mean differences (SMD) in inattention, hyperactive-impulsive and
combined symptoms were assessed as rated by parents, teachers or all raters. The inﬂuence of study
characteristics and PUFA regimen content was explored in multivariable meta-regression analyses. The overall
pooled estimate from 18 studies showed that combined ADHD symptoms rated by all raters decreased with
PUFA supplementation; SMD  0.192 (95% CI:  0.297,  0.086; Po0.001). However, when analyzed by rater,
only parent-rated symptoms decreased signiﬁcantly. Multivariable meta-regression showed that longer study
duration, γ-linolenic acid (GLA), and the interaction between GLA and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) were
associated with signiﬁcant decreases in inattention; however, PUFA regimen content was unrelated to changes
in hyperactive-impulsive symptoms. Certain fatty acids present in placebo preparations may potentially have
been psychoactive. This meta-analysis provides modest evidence of PUFA effectiveness in ADHD, especially GLA
and EPA for inattention symptoms; however, evidence of reporting bias, publication bias, variable methodological quality, and use of potentially psychoactive placebos limit the generalizability of these ﬁndings.

1. Introduction
Attention-deﬁcit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is relatively common and increasing in importance; recent prevalence estimates in
childhood are 8.7–10.6% [1]. The burden associated with childhood
and adolescent ADHD includes diminished quality of life for patients
and their families [2], increased economic costs [3], and if inadequately

managed, an increased risk for the development of long-term academic underachievement [4], conduct disorder [5–7], alcohol dependence during adulthood in males [8], and later antisocial personality
and/or criminality [9–11].
During the 1990s, the multi-site collaborative randomized trial
known as the Multimodal Treatment Study of Children with ADHD
(MTA) was set up by the National Institute of Mental Health to
examine comparative long-term treatment effectiveness of medication
management (involving carefully crafted methylphenidate titration
followed by monthly visits) versus behavioral treatment versus
combined methylphenidate and behavioral treatment versus routine

The Ovid platform was also employed to search the EMBASE
and psycINFO databases using the following terms:
(attention deﬁcit OR hyperactivity OR impulsivity OR ADHD) AND
(treatment OR administration OR randomized OR randomised OR
placebo OR trial OR study) AND (children OR adolescents OR child OR
adolescent) AND (fatty acids OR essential fatty acids OR ﬁsh oil OR
polyunsaturated OR eicosapentaenoic OR docosahexaenoic).
As of the 28th July 2013, 146 abstracts were identiﬁed from the
PubMed search, and 1259 abstracts were identiﬁed from the
EMBASE and psycINFO databases, giving a total of 1129 abstracts
after duplicates were removed.
From the combined PubMed and Ovid searches, 32 abstracts
were selected for examination of the full citation on the basis of
the following inclusion criteria: (i) randomized design; (ii) placebo
controlled; (iii) use of a PUFA preparation as active intervention;
and (iv) reporting sufﬁcient statistical results on changes in scores
of a validated rating-scale measure of ADHD symptoms in
response to intervention. Studies were included if they reported
changes in ADHD symptoms in children and/or adolescents with a
formal diagnosis of ADHD or without (for example, dyslexia,
developmental coordination disorder, or reading impairment in
otherwise normal children). Studies examining changes in ADHD
symptoms in children and/or adolescents with autistic spectrum
disorders were excluded.
Of these 32 full citations, 18 citations were identiﬁed that
described studies that could be subjected to meta-analytic review
(one placebo-controlled trial, although not described as randomized in the study report, was conﬁrmed as randomized by the
author [30] and was therefore included) and 14 citations were
excluded (see PRISMA ﬂow diagram in Supplementary eFig. 1).
Reasons for exclusion were as follows; 1, not randomized [31];
1, not placebo-controlled [32]; 3, open-label [33–35]; 2, letters
related to primary publication [36,37]; 1, results reported as
median values and despite contacting the corresponding author
no mean and standard deviation values could be obtained [38];
1, in adults [39]; 2, reported cognitive function tests only [40,41];
1, no rating of hyperactivity or inattention [42]; 1, reporting fatty
acid proﬁles related to an earlier randomized controlled trial [43];
and 1, no data presented for numbers of patients in each treatment group [44]. Of note, our selection strategy identiﬁed all
studies included in a recent Cochrane systematic review [28],
which employed a more extensive search strategy of multiple
databases. Therefore, despite the simplicity of the present search
strategy, it is unlikely that signiﬁcant studies have been missed.
The characteristics of the ﬁnal 18 included studies are shown in
Table 1.

2.1. Search strategy

2.2. Outcome measures

Articles were identiﬁed for inclusion in the meta-analysis using
the following search strategy with no speciﬁc start date. The
PubMed database was searched using the following MeSH and
free terms:

ADHD rating scales were chosen as meta-analytic outcomes
rather than neuropsychological tests of attention or impulsivity,
because neuropsychological tests were employed less frequently
and more variably than rating scales to have allowed for reliable

community care [12]. At 14-month follow-up, the medication arm was
superior to both behavioral treatment (parent, school, and child
components, with therapist involvement gradually reduced over time)
and routine community care (which included medication in twothirds of cases) [13]. However, intent-to-treat analyses showed that the
beneﬁt of medication management was completely lost at three-year
follow-up, with no signiﬁcant differences in ADHD symptoms apparent between the four groups [14]; furthermore, pharmacotherapy was
associated with growth retardation [15].
There is anxiety among parents and professionals alike [16–18]
about the side-effects of long-term stimulant pharmacotherapy,
including effects on brain development and the subsequent risk of
substance abuse. In juvenile rats, methylphenidate induces lipid
and protein damage in the prefrontal cortex [19], and decreases
anterior cingulate cortical intra-network functional connectivity,
striatal myelination, striatal volume, and increases corpus callosal
fractional anisotropy [20]. Of relevance to the concern about future
vulnerability to drug abuse, early exposure to methylphenidate
increases responsiveness to cocaine in adult male rats [21]. In
addition, non-stimulant medication for ADHD such as atomoxetine
is associated with troublesome side-effects such as nausea, loss of
appetite, dry mouth, insomnia and fatigue [22]. Therefore, there is
an ongoing search for alternative effective ADHD treatments with
good tolerability and safety.
In their seminal study, Stevens and colleagues reported that
boys with ADHD had lower concentrations than controls of certain
plasma polar lipids (20:4n  6, 20:5n  3, and 22:6n  3) and
erythrocyte lipids (20:4n  6 and 22:4n 6) [23]. Furthermore,
children with lower compositions of total omega-3 fatty acids
had more behavioral problems, temper tantrums, and learning,
health and sleep problems than did those with high proportions of
omega-3 fatty acids [23,24]. In 1981, Colquhoun and Bunday put
forward the hypothesis that many of the clinical features of ADHD
could be explained on the basis of an underlying abnormality of
fatty acid metabolism, and further hypothesized that treatment
with poly-unsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) may be of therapeutic
value [25]. This fatty-acid model might also explain the comorbidity of ADHD with dyslexia, developmental coordination
disorder, and autism spectrum disorders [26].
There have been several randomized controlled PUFA trials in
children and adolescents with ADHD in recent years with metaanalytic investigations beginning to appear in the literature [27–29].
Given that these meta-analyses have drawn different conclusions
on overall effectiveness of PUFAs [27–29], the differential efﬁcacy
of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) versus docosahexaenoic acid
(DHA) [27], the role of combined omega-6 and omega-3 PUFA
supplementation [28], and the inﬂuence of symptom rater blinding [29], we carried out an exploratory meta-regression analysis of
ADHD trials examining the role of PUFAs with no a priori assumption concerning which PUFA might or might not be effective in
alleviating symptoms of ADHD. To achieve this we performed a
meta-analysis of rating scale outcomes adjusted for reporting bias
in combination with meta-regression analyses using data from
independent fatty acid content analyses of study regimens, which
to our knowledge has not previously been undertaken.

pooling of data across studies. Inattention and hyperactive-impulsive subscales of ADHD rating scales could be reliably obtained
from most studies, rated either by both parents and teachers or by
either parents or teachers (in some studies a clinician rated
symptoms instead of a teacher). A list of outcome measures
employed is shown in Table 1.
Individual corresponding authors were contacted to provide as
much missing data as possible; means and standard deviations were
obtained for the Hirayama et al. study that quoted median values
[45]; parent ratings for the Conners' Abbreviated Parent-Teacher
questionnaire were obtained for the Raz et al. study [46]; means and
standard deviations were obtained for the Bélanger et al. study that
used mean percent change from baseline without a measure of
variation [47]; raw data were provided for re-analysis from the
Perera et al. study whose published effect size conﬁdence interval
values contained errors [48]. The authors of this last study also
provided the English translation of the ADHD questionnaire used in
the study [49], enabling scales for inattention and hyperactiveimpulsive symptoms to be constructed. In a recent Cochrane review
examining PUFA supplementation in ADHD [28], the study by Aman
et al. [30] was excluded because the outcome variable contained no
variation; however, we were able to compute an effect size from the
published F statistic.

Baseline symptoms, study duration, study sample size, study
quality, and individual fatty acid doses were employed as potential
moderating variables.
Baseline symptoms scores were constructed by calculating
t-scores for all rating scales across studies using published normative values and prorated according to the age and sex distribution of
each individual study. One study used raw DSM-IV symptom counts
as a measure of ADHD symptoms [45]; in the absence of normative
data to obtain a t-score, the baseline value for this study was
imputed as the mean of all other values. One study quoted SNAP-IV
baseline mean values for combined ADHD symptoms as 2.62 (range
1.89–4.00) when the maximum score for this outcome measure is
3 [50]. The authors of this latter study were contacted and provided
the raw baseline data, which showed that the 4-point Likert scale
had been scored from 1–4 instead of 0–3. The mean baseline value
was recalculated using the conventional 0–3 scoring system.
Methodological study quality was assessed using the Jadad
score [51] plus 7 additional components: (i) whether similarities in
baseline characteristics were adequately described; (ii) whether
attempts were made to conceal the ﬁsh taste of the active intervention; (iii) whether the outcome assessors were adequately blinded;
(iv) whether all available data were reported; (v) whether data were
analyzed according to intention-to-treat (ITT) methods; (vi) whether
compliance was assessed through measurement of erythrocyte or
plasma fatty acids; and (vii) whether blinding success was evaluated.
This gave a maximum possible quality score of 12.
Individual PUFA doses were calculated for all precursor fatty
acids from linoleic acid (LA) up to and including arachidonic acid
(AA) constituting the omega-6 pathway, and all precursor fatty
acids from α-linolenic acid (ALA) up to and including EPA and DHA
constituting the omega-3 pathway, by conducting independent
FAME analyses of all PUFA regimens, except where the detailed
fatty acid content of the PUFA regimen was already published. FAME
analyses were conducted by Eclipse ALS, Cambridge, UK. This
approach conferred two major advantages. First, it gave a more
reliable assessment of the precise PUFA content of the regimens; for
example, some studies reported just one or two PUFAs that were
considered relevant by the investigators and others gave a full PUFA
proﬁle. Second, it enabled us to conduct meta-regression analyses
with no prior assumption as to which PUFA might be active or

using the program Comprehensive Meta-Analysis (http://www.meta-a

purpose in a recent systematic review [52]. The program allows mean
effect sizes to be computed in studies that use multiple outcome
measures; for example, two different questionnaire measures of ADHD
symptoms plus a categorical measure of clinical improvement, allowing all available data relating to ADHD symptoms to be included in
this analysis. We have previously shown that this strategy is more

conservative and less likely to introduce bias than using an investigator-determined hierarchical scheme to select which outcome measure to enter into the meta-analysis [53].
In studies that measured outcomes rated by both parents and
teachers, ﬁve of these failed to report negative outcomes from one
or other rater [46,47,54–56]. In four of these studies [47,54–56],
we were unable to obtain the missing data from authors; therefore, SMDs of zero with a standard error equal to that of the
reported outcome were used to impute these missing data in order
to reduce the risk of overestimation of treatment effects consequent to reporting bias. The Hirayama et al. [45] study rated ADHD
symptoms by both parents and teachers but scores were counted
only when both raters gave the same assessment. Whilst this
strategy was consistent with diagnostic requirements that ADHD
symptoms be present in more than one context, it is potentially
open to bias as ‘same assessment’ was not deﬁned. We contacted
the author but individual parent and teacher ratings were not
available and, given the composite nature of the outcome used in
this study, we were unable to impute the missing data.
The meta-analytic strategy employed was as follows: (i) to compute overall effect sizes using a random effects model for combined
ADHD symptoms, and inattention and hyperactive-impulsive symptoms separately, rated by both parents and teachers combined, and
by parents and teachers separately; (ii) to examine for possible
publication bias using funnel plots, Egger's test, and Duval and
Tweedie's trim and ﬁll method; (iii) to assess heterogeneity using
Cohen's Q; and (iv) to explore heterogeneity with univariable and
multivariable random effects meta-regression analyses using relevant
moderator variables (baseline symptom scores, study duration, study
sample size, study quality, mean age of children in each study,
percentage of male children in each study, and individual PUFA
doses). Meta-regression analyses were conducted with the metafor
package in R, available via the Comprehensive R Archive Network at
http://CRAN.R-project.org/package=metafor, using the restricted
maximum likelihood estimator and Knapp and Hartung adjustment.
The latter adjustment generates more conservative P-values for
model parameters and an overall F-test of the signiﬁcance of
moderators in the model.
In order to reduce the number of variables simultaneously
entered into the multivariable meta-regression analyses, fatty acid
doses were summed into AA þprecursors (18:2n  6 LA, 18:3n  6
γ-linolenic acid [GLA], 20:2n  6 eicosadienoic acid [EDA],
20:3n  6 dihomo-γ-linolenic acid [DGLA]), EPA þprecursors
(18:3n  3 ALA, 18:4n  3 stearidonic acid [SDA], 20:3n  3 eicosatrienoic acid [ETA], 20:4n  3 eicosatetraenoic acid [ETTA]) and
DHA þprecursor (22:5n 3 docosapentaenoic acid [DPA]). If any
one of these groups were signiﬁcant, between-group interactions
and individual within-group fatty acids were tested to obtain the

best ﬁtting model on the basis of the F-test for moderators.
Statistical signiﬁcance was established using α o0.05 without
adjustment for multiple comparisons as this investigation was
considered to be an exploratory analysis.

3. Results
The overall effect using a random effects model showed a small
but signiﬁcant decrease in combined ADHD symptoms rated by all
raters with PUFA supplementation in the 18 studies (Fig. 1A); SMD
 0.192 (95% CI:  0.297,  0.086; P o0.001). The effect remained
signiﬁcant for both inattention and hyperactive-impulsive symptoms when examined separately and rated by all raters (Table 2).
However, these signiﬁcant effects appeared to be mediated by
parent ratings as SMD estimates using parent ratings were consistently higher than those using all raters and SMD estimates
using teacher ratings were consistently insigniﬁcant (Table 2).
Egger's test was not signiﬁcant (intercept  0.717; 95% CI:
 2.048, 0.614; df ¼18; P ¼0.272); however, there was evidence
of publication bias as shown by the asymmetrical funnel plot
(Fig. 1B). Using Duval and Tweedie's trim and ﬁll, ﬁve additional
imputed studies (solid circles) were needed to correct the asymmetry of the observed studies (open circles), which reduced the
SMD estimate to a non-signiﬁcant level of  0.118 (95% CI:  0.250,
0.014).
Although there was little evidence of statistically signiﬁcant
heterogeneity between studies (Table 2), a wide range of PUFA
regimens were employed and thus, the studies were heterogeneous
with respect to the clinical interventions employed. Univariable and
multivariable meta-regression analyses were conducted to explore
the possible inﬂuence of these heterogeneous PUFA regimens on
outcome.
On univariable meta-regression analysis, study duration (SMD
 0.098; 95% CI:  0.193,  0.003; P ¼0.043), EDA dose (SMD
 49.406; 95% CI:  95.634,  3.179; P ¼0.038), and DGLA dose
(SMD  25.956; (5% CI:  50.000,  1.911; P ¼0.036)) were signiﬁcantly associated with decreases in combined ADHD symptoms
(Supplementary eTable 2). EPA dose was associated with a
decrease in combined ADHD symptoms, but this decrease was
not statistically signiﬁcant (SMD  0.328; 95% CI:  0.674, 0.018;
P¼ 0.062). DHA dose was associated with an increase in combined
ADHD symptoms, but this increase was not statistically signiﬁcant
(SMD 0.197; 95% CI:  0.167, 0.560; P ¼0.271).
On multivariable meta-regression analysis, the following ﬁndings
were identiﬁed. For all ADHD symptoms combined, precursors up to

and including AA plus the interaction between precursors up to and
including AA and precursors up to and including EPA (but not
precursors up to and including DHA) were signiﬁcantly associated
with a decrease in symptoms after controlling for background factors
(baseline symptoms, study duration, sample size, study quality, mean
age and percentage of male children). For inattention symptoms,
similar ﬁndings of an interaction between precursors up to and

after controlling for background factors (See Model 8 in Table 3). For
hyperactive symptoms, the background factors of baseline hyperactive symptoms, study duration, and study sample size were signiﬁcantly associated with changes in hyperactive symptoms; however,
PUFA supplementation was not (Table 3).
A subgroup analysis dividing the studies on the basis of whether
GLA and EPA were present in combination (threshold values Z1 mg
for both GLA and EPA) showed that the pooled SMD in inattention
symptoms (rated by all raters) was signiﬁcantly lower for the
GLAþEPA present group ( 0.309; 95% CI:  0.462, 0.155;

4. Discussion and conclusions
We found that PUFA supplementation was associated with a
small decrease in combined ADHD symptoms and that GLA plus
the interaction between GLA and EPA was effective for inattention
symptoms.
Signiﬁcant pooled effects were found for parent ratings but not
for teacher or clinician ratings. This might have resulted from a
failure of blinding to group status during the trials as only a few
studies assessed blinding success. A recent meta-analysis examining both dietary and psychological interventions for ADHD also
found a greater likelihood of signiﬁcant results if symptoms were
rated by those closest to the therapeutic setting [29]. An alternative explanation is that parents may be better at discerning
subtle behavioral changes in their children than are teachers.
Regarding the univariable meta-regression, longer study duration, EDA and DGLA dose were found to be signiﬁcantly associated
with a decrease in combined ADHD symptoms. We did not ﬁnd a
univariable relationship with EPA dose as in an earlier metaanalysis by Bloch and Qawasmi [27]. However, we included more
studies, we employed a combined outcome measure strategy that
we have previously shown is less subject to bias and generates
more conservative SMD estimates [53], and we imputed missing
data for studies failing to report negative outcomes, again generating more conservative SMD estimates. Although the univariable estimate for EPA dose in the current meta-analysis ( 0.328;
95% CI:  0.674, 0.018; p ¼0.062) was of a similar magnitude to
that found by Bloch and Qawasmi (0.36; 95% CI: 0.01, 0.72;
p ¼0.04) [27], the methodological differences in the current
meta-analysis, in which reporting bias was accounted for and
which included a larger number studies, explain why the univariable estimate for EPA dose did not reach statistical signiﬁcance.
Regarding the multivariable meta-regression ﬁndings, ﬁrst, there
was no effect of PUFAs on hyperactive symptoms; however, high

baseline hyperactive symptoms were associated with persistent
symptoms and longer study duration with a decrease in symptoms.
This might represent a developmental maturation phenomenon independent of PUFA supplementation. Second, there was strong evidence
that longer study duration, GLA, and the interaction between GLA and
EPA were associated with reduced inattention symptoms. These metaregression ﬁndings were further conﬁrmed by a subgroup analysis
showing a reduction in inattention symptoms using a regimen
containing EPA and GLA, but no reduction in inattention symptoms
in studies that did not include these PUFAs in combination.
EPA has long been recognized as being an omega-3 anti-inﬂammatory PUFA with potential beneﬁts in cardiovascular disorders and
depression [57]. However, the potential anti-inﬂammatory beneﬁt of
GLA has tended to be overshadowed; interestingly, in animal models
of cognitive function, GLA and EPA block lipopolysaccharide-induced
inhibition of long-term potentiation [58]. The ﬁrst step for omega-6
and omega-3 PUFA biosynthesis from the essential fatty acids LA and
ALA, respectively, involves the enzyme delta-6-desaturase, which
may be vulnerable to inhibition by factors such as micronutrient
deﬁciencies, viral infections, and the stress hormone cortisol [59].
Given that plasma AA and DHA are low in children with ADHD
[24,60,61], supplementation with GLA and EPA would bypass this
step for both AA and DHA biosynthesis, respectively. There was no
evidence for DHA effectiveness. We have previously argued
that because DHA is at the end of the biosynthetic pathway, and
supplementation with exogenous DHA risks accumulation of proinﬂammatory reactive derivatives, EPA supplementation may be
safer way to increase membrane DHA, notwithstanding the potential
inﬂuence of the anti-inﬂammatory effects of EPA itself [62].
This study has several strengths: a combined outcome measure
strategy reduced investigator bias [53]; the inﬂuence of reporting
bias was reduced by imputing data for studies that failed to report
negative outcomes; an independent FAME analysis of fatty acid
content was conducted enabling assessment of all PUFAs of potential relevance; and, a multivariable meta-regression controlled for
background study-related factors, which allowed for limited
hypothesis-generating testing of PUFA interactions.
Weaknesses of this study include the following: although the
pooled effect was statistically signiﬁcant, only two studies showed a

signiﬁcant effect by themselves [48,63]; the funnel plot showed
evidence of publication bias; there was evidence of reporting bias;
few studies were formally registered; study methodological quality
was variable; and the placebo used across studies varied. Regarding
this latter issue, some of the placebo preparations may have been
psychoactive and thereby reduced the apparent effectiveness of
PUFAs. Some studies employed placebo preparations containing
omega-6 PUFAs, which could, on this analysis, have been psychoactive. Others used olive oil, which contains oleic acid, which is also
psychoactive [64]. Indeed, the oleic acid content of regimens was
associated in the present analysis with a decrease in symptoms, but
this decrease was not signiﬁcant (Supplementary eTable 2). However, even a non-signiﬁcant decrease in symptoms might mask
genuine differences between regimens if these were present.
A further weakness of all included studies is that none attempted
to control for the PUFA content of the background diets consumed,
which could have varied widely.
In conclusion, while this meta-analysis shows evidence of PUFA
efﬁcacy in ADHD, and especially GLA plus GLA-EPA interaction for
inattention, it has highlighted the need for better designed trials.
Not only should such trials be properly registered, adequately
powered, and methodologically rigorous with the use of nonpsychoactive placebos and controlled diets, but also, given the
identiﬁed importance of study duration, they should last for at
least six months in order reliably to identify an effect.

Full PUFA content obtained from Fatty Acid Methyl Esters (FAME) analysis, Eclipse ALS, Cambridge, UK. bFull PUFA content obtained from Food Standards Australia New
Zealand.[19] cPUFA content obtained from published reference. dData for EDA, DGLA, SDA, ETA and ETTA were not present in the published reference and were, therefore, assumed
to be negligible and assigned a value of zero (the authors and manufacturers of these regimens were contacted on several occasions but no further clarification was obtained). eIn this
study, the number of capsules administered was according weight bands (participants between 16–25 kg received 2 capsules/day, between 26–35 kg, 3 capsules/day, and between
36–45 kg, 4 capsules/day). The authors were contacted to confirm that 12 children received 2 capsules/day, 15, 3 capsules/day and 10, 4 capsules/day, giving an average capsule
consumption of 2.95 capsule/day.
