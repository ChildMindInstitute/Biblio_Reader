P.A. BANDETTINI. Functional MRI: The History, Basics, Cutting
Edge, and Future.
In this three hour lecture, I will give a broad yet hopefully informative
and entertaining perspective of fMRI technology, methodology, signal
interpretation, and to some degree, fMRI applications. The lecture will
start with a detailed overview of how fMRI began. It will then continue
with an in-depth description of fMRI contrast mechanisms – including
blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) contrast but going beyond this
to other less common but nevertheless important contrast mechanisms
– including blood perfusion, volume, and cerebral oxidative metabolic
rate (CMRO2). Following this, the lecture will include a discussion of
the principles of fMRI temporal and spatial resolution, as well as how
to avoid common mistakes in fMRI signal interpretation. In the “cutting edge” section of this lecture I will discuss some of the more recent
developments of fMRI, including resting state fMRI, fMRI decoding,
individual classification with fMRI, and real time fMRI. I will conclude
with some thoughts on the most interesting directions where fMRI is
heading. These include the clinical use of fMRI on individuals to aid
in psychiatric/neurologic/developmental disorder diagnosis as well as
prediction of outcome and monitoring of therapy.
Learning Objectives
Following this lecture, the student should be able to:
State the year when the first BOLD papers came out as well as the first
groups that demonstrated fMRI,
Describe in detail two other contrast mechanisms other than BOLD
contrast,
Describe specifically what limits both spatial and temporal resolution
in BOLD-based fMRI,
Describe a clinical application of real time fMRI, and
List at least two other potential clinical applications of fMRI on individual subjects.

M. LAMAR & M.T. SCHULTHEIS. Science and Practice
Considerations for Bilingual Neuropsychology: A Focus on the
Hispanic/Latino Community.
There are ~55 million Hispanics/Latinos living in the US representing
17% of the total US population, these numbers will more than double
to ~130 million or 31% of the US population by 2060 (CDC, 2014);
thus, understanding the needs of this community as it relates to the
science and practice of neuropsychology is critical. This course will
first review the literature on cognition and brain aging as it relates to
Hispanics/Latinos and highlight key areas of concern for both research
and clinical work with this population. Second, clinical considerations
will be addressed more specifically as they relate to adequate assessment,
including review of considerations for selection of tests, norms and interpretation of Hispanic/Latino evaluations. Third, ethical considerations
for working with bilingual individuals will be addressed. The workshop
will conclude with a brief discussion of areas for future directions for
both research and clinical needs.
As a result of participation in this course, the learner will achieve the
following objectives:
Obtain a deeper understanding of the key issues impacting brain aging
in Hispanics/Latinos,
Identify strengths and weaknesses of existing measures for bilingual

CE 3. Advancing Developmental Science Through
the Application of Pediatric Neuropsychology in
Africa
Presenters: Michael J. Boivin, Bruno Giordani

9:00 a.m.–12:00 p.m.
M.J. BOIVIN & B. GIORDANI. Advancing Developmental Science
Through the Application of Pediatric Neuropsychology in Africa.
Using exemplars from our research over the past 25 years, we present
an overview of the application of neuropsychology to evaluate public
health factors related to risk and resilience in sub-Saharan African children in resource-limited settings. We will present examples of clinical
intervention and observational studies in early and middle childhood
pertaining to pediatric infectious disease (e.g., HIV, Malaria), chronic
disease (e.g., sickle-cell anemia), environmental risk factors (e.g., konzo
disease), and neurodevelopmental intervention studies (e.g., computerized cognitive training, caregiver training). The theoretical construct
of a universal brain/behavior omnibus (Boivin & Giordani, 2009) will
be used as an organizational framework for understanding the orchestration of developmental plasticity in brain/behavior development,

including illustrations of interactions in brain/behavior development
at culture-brain, culture-gene, and gene-brain levels. Our principal resource for this workshop will be our edited book the Neuropsychology
of Children in Africa: Perspectives on Risk and Resilience (Springer
Publishing, May 2013), as well as a forthcoming review of child neurodisability in the global context, to be published in Nature, 2016.
The integration of neuropsychological science with risk and resilience
in the global health context can provide a powerful vantage point for
outcome in clinical trials, specifically, and for the universal advancement
of brain-behavior science in children, in general.
Learning Objectives
Recount at least several public health factors related to risk and resilience in neuropsychological development in African children.
Recount several evidence-based interventions in African children to
enhance neurodevelopmental and neuropsychological outcomes in
low-resource settings.
Articulate several ways in which neuropsychology research with children
in Africa has advanced child development science in general.

CE 4. Characterizing and Guiding Brain Plasticity
Across the Lifespan
Presenter: Alvaro Pascual-Leone

1:00–4:00 p.m.
A. PASCUAL-LEONE. Characterizing and Guiding Brain Plasticity
Across the Lifespan.
The human brain is made up of neurones, highly sophisticated and stable cellular structures. However, neurones are engaged in dynamically
changing networks that provide a most energy efficient, spatially compact, and precise means to process input signals and generate adaptable
responses to a changing environment. Plasticity is an intrinsic property
of such networks, and may be best conceptualized as evolution’s invention to enable the nervous system to escape the restrictions of its
own genome (and its highly specialized cellular specification), and thus
adapt to environmental pressures, physiologic changes, and experiences.
Consider the challenges faces by a musician. Playing a musical instrument, requires more than factual knowledge about the musical instrument and about the mechanics of how it is played. The central nervous
system has to acquire and implement a “translation mechanism” to
convert knowledge into action. These translation capabilities, acquired
over years of practice, result in changes in the organization of the brain.
Initially, while learning a musical instrument (as indeed while acquiring
any other skill) rapid changes take place in the brain, that probably
represent the unmasking and activation of existing pathways. Eventually, over months and years of sustained practice, more stable, structural
changes appear to take place.
Beyond such learning-realted brain changes, the brain also changes
across the lifespan in response to environmental influences, life events,
experiences, etc. At the same time, the mechanisms of plasticity and the
resulting brain dynamics vary, as indeed they vary across individuals
and are modified by genetic predispositions, environmental influences,
life experiences and even age. Innovative experimental paradigms can
assess cortical plasticity in humans, in vivo, across the lifespan, and
offer translatable biomarkers that can bridge the gap between animal
models and humans.

Ultimately, changes in brain plasticity and dynamics may proof maladaptive and lead to disease. Aberrant, excessive or insufficient, or
mistimed plasticity may represent the proximal pathogenic cause of
neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders such as autism
spectrum disorders, schizophrenia, or Alzheimer’s disease. On the other
hand, optimizing activity within and across brain networks can promote brain health, sustain cognitive function and well-being across the
life-span, and leverage the impact of brain function on overall health
(salutogenesis).
Learning objectives:
1. Explain the concept of plasticity as a life-long intrinsic property of
the human brain.
2. Describe mechanisms of plasticity
3. Demonstrate about methods to assess the mechanisms of plasticity
in humans.
4. Discuss implications of brain plasticity for brain health.

R. AU. Cognitive Aging in the Digital Era: Role of Global
Partnerships.
Current approaches to study cognitive aging and dementia take a largely
silo approach that leads to incremental progress tied to pre-existing
presumptions. Accepting the reality that what we know may be far less
than what we don’t know, and that true paradigmatic shifts in science
often are galvanized by those coming from outside the inner academic

Forty Fourth Annual INS Meeting Abstracts
circles, it is important to look beyond the traditional and embrace new
approaches. Digital technology and big data is fueling unprecedented
new directions in the commercial community. President Obama’s Precision Medicine Initiative and NIH’s interest in a million person megastudy
is also creating a ground shift in what might be the more effective means
for conducting medical research. Within this context, how we study
outcomes of cognitive aging, including those associated with traumatic
brain injury, progressive and non-progressive neurological disorders,
developmental learning processes needs to be considered. The objective of this course is to introduce how digital technologies and global
partnerships can lead to transformative research methods from which
to develop more effective strategies for promoting cognitive health, AD
disease prevention and early detection capabilities of previously believed
asymptomatic stages to facilitate effective intervention strategies (e.g.,
drug development and psychosocial/behavioral interventions).
Learning Objectives
Describe how digital technology can be used to enhance cognitive assessment and the factors affecting it
Explain how to balance between novel and innovative in the context of
the current peer-review system
Describe how to develop a global research initiative that includes academic and non-academic partners that builds short and longer-term
capacity.

CE 6. Dynamic Considerations in
Neuropsychological Assessment of Depressive
Disorders:
State, Trait, Scar and Burden
Presenter: Scott A. Langenecker

1:00–4:00 p.m.
S . A . L A N G E N E C K E R . Dynamic Considerations in
Neuropsychological Assessment of Depressive Disorders: State,
Trait, Scar and Burden.
Depression is a frequently occurring psychiatric disorder, with a yearly
prevalence of nearly 10% in the adult population, and lifetime prevalence around 20%. Depression is also frequently observed as a comorbid condition with other disorders, such as dementia, cardiovascular
illness, traumatic brain injury, multiple sclerosis, learning disability,
etc., frequently as a secondary outcome. Tremendous strides have been
made toward understanding the neuropsychological, neuroanatomical,
and neuroimaging findings associated with depression. Whereas understanding of the neuroanatomical networks involved in depression and
related mood disorders remains in an adolescent phase, neuropsychological findings in depression and related mood disorders are fairly well
codified at this point. The neuropsychological findings in depression
include difficulties in attention, psychomotor speed, executive functioning, memory, and emotion recognition. In addition, there are a number
of clinical, course, lifespan and demographic features that substantially
impact cognitive performance in the context of a mood disorder. These
include family history, age of onset, polypharmacy/substance abuse,
medical complications, symptom levels, greater severity, number of
episodes, and resistance to traditional treatments. Whereas the etiologies for depression- associated cognitive difficulties are heterogeneous,
the co-occurrence of features of depression and cognitive difficulties of
specific types suggests a common set of neural networks that may be
adversely affected, including medial and ventral frontal, limbic, and
basal ganglia structures. Neuroimaging paradigms offer meaningful
and translational techniques for probing these affected circuits and for
understanding treatment options and targets.

Matter Integrity of the Corpus Callosum Mediates the Relationship
Between Cardiorespiratory Fitness and Processing Speed in a
Population of Cognitively Normal Older Adults.
Objective: There is increasing evidence that cardiorespiratory fitness
(CRF) protects against age-related declines in processing speed ability
(PS), although the underlying biological mechanisms remain unclear.
One possibility is that white matter integrity (WM), known to correlate
with reduced PS in normal aging, mediates this relationship. In this
study, we investigated the impact of white matter (WM) integrity on
the relationship between CRF and PS in a population of functionally
intact older adults.
Participants and Methods: The study included 150 functionally intact older adult subjects (mean age=73) recruited from the University
of California San Francisco Memory and Aging Center. Subjects underwent neuropsychological assessment and MRI. CRF was calculated
from an equation based on age, gender, body weight, blood pressure,
and self-reported physical activity (Jurca et al., 2005). Mean fractional
anisotropy (FA) of the corpus callosum (CC) using diffusion tensor
imaging was our measure of WM integrity. We ran linear regression
models to evaluate the hypothesis that the relationship between PS and
CRF is mediated by WM.
Results: CRF was significantly correlated with PS, and the relationship
remained significant after controlling for education (p= .014; 4.1% of
variance explained). When WM was included in the first step of the
regression model, it uniquely accounted for 8.8% of variance, and when
CRF was entered into the model next, the contribution of CRF on PS
was no longer significant (p= .159).
Conclusions: Findings support the hypothesis that CRF contributes to
PS ability via WM integrity of the CC in cognitively normal older adults.
Results support prior research of the protective benefits of CRF against
age-related cognitive and neurological decline, and amplify the need
to consider lifestyle factors that can prevent cognitive change among
older adult populations. Importantly, the impact was observed only
in the presence of objective WM abnormality and CRF alone may be
insufficient to produce behavioral change.

K.A. BURNETT, A.A. VAILLANCOURT, P.A. FIGUEROA,
L.K. PAUL & W.S. BROWN. Inflexible Social Norm Perception in
Agenesis of the Corpus Callosum.
Objective: High-functioning adults with agenesis of the corpus callosum
(ACC) tend to have a deficient theory of mind and to lack psychosocial
insight, exhibiting socially awkward behavior and naiveté. These social
deficits affect mental health and quality of life, yet are often overlooked
due to normal IQ. To enhance the clinical neuropsychological profile
of ACC, the present study tested whether adults with ACC correctly
identify appropriate behaviors within social norms.
Participants and Methods: This study included 17 adults with ACC
and normal IQ (age 19–55; FSIQ 88–118), and 21 neurotypical adult
controls with normal IQ (age 19–64; FSIQ 103–115). Groups did not
differ significantly in age, FSIQ, or gender. All participants resided in
the U.S. and completed the Social Norms Questionnaire (SNQ22), a
measure of social knowledge (Rankin et al., 2009). The SNQ22 asks
whether certain social behaviors are appropriate based on dominant
U.S. culture.
Results: Overall, the ACC group scored significantly lower in understanding social norms (M = 17.9) than controls (M = 19.4), etap2 = .16,
F(1, 36) = 6.99, p = .01. Specifically, the ACC group over-adhered to
social norms (M = 3.41) significantly more than controls (M = 1.24),
etap2 = .29, F(1, 36) = 14.33, p < .001. There was no significant difference regarding breaking of social norms.
Conclusions: As expected, adults with ACC scored lower than controls on the SNQ22, indicating deficient knowledge of the nuances of
social norms. The ACC group did not endorse breaking norms, but
over-adherence to perceived social norms suggesting lack of nuance
or exceptions (e.g. choosing “not appropriate” to “eat ribs with your
fingers”). Adults with ACC may thus know social norms concretely (i.e.
“use silverware when eating”), yet lack the ability to integrate context in
specific scenarios. Previous ACC research suggested deficient complex
novel problem-solving. Lack of appreciation of context and exception
may be a reflection of this more general deficiency.

J. HA, L.K. PAUL & W.S. BROWN. Verbal Problem Solving in
Individuals with Agenesis of the Corpus Callosum.
Objective: Previous research demonstrated that individuals with agenesis of the corpus callosum (ACC) have difficulty in tasks requiring
complex novel problem-solving and abstract thinking (Brown & Paul,
2000). However, whether this difficulty includes verbal problem-solving
is not clear. This research examined the hypothesis that individuals
with ACC also have difficulty in verbal abstract reasoning, hypothesis
testing, and mental flexibility using the Word Context Test subtests of
the Delis-Kaplan Executive Function System (D-KEFS ; Delis, Kaplan,
& Kramer, 2001).
Participants and Methods: The D-KEFS was administered to 25 individuals with ACC (age 16-52; M = 24.9; FSIQ 78-129, M = 94.6; VIQ
78-134, M = 95.4), and 15 neurotypical controls (age 20-44, M = 29.5;
FSIQ 84-116, M =101.8; VIQ 86-117, M = 103.5). The Word Context
subtest of the D-KEFS has 2 measures: Consecutively Correct Responses
(CCR) and Repeated Incorrect Responses (RIR). CCR describes the total
number of consecutively correct responses that the participants obtain
in the 10-item test. The RIR is the total number of responses that are
consecutively incorrect.
Results: The ACC group performed significantly worse than the control
group, F (1, 38) = 8.54, p=.01, etap2 = .18. However, the groups did not
differ on the RIR (F (1, 38) = 2.01, p = .16, etap2 = .05). Since there
was a trend suggesting a difference in VIQ between ACC and the control

groups, analyses were rerun covarying VIQ. The group difference for
CCR remained significant, F(1, 37) = 4.63, p < .05, etap2 = .11. The
result for RIR also remained consistent with no significant difference
between groups, F(1, 37) = 0.99, p = .33, etap2 = .03.
Conclusions: These finding indicates that individuals with ACC are
less efficient in their analytic ability and problem-solving. They had
difficulty integrating multiple bits of information in order to generate
and test hypotheses. However, the lack of group diff on RIR score suggests that they were not more likely than controls to repeat the same
incorrect response.

Callosal Ideomotor Apraxia in Alzheimer’s Disease.
Objective: Studies of right handed patients with corpus callosum injury
have revealed an impaired ability to perform skilled movements with
their left upper limb (callosal apraxia). Whereas some patients make left
upper limb spatial and temporal errors primarily in response to verbal
commands (verbal callosal disconnection apraxia), other patients with
callosal injury make these errors with imitation and even when using
actual tools, (callosal ideomotor apraxia). Some patients with callosal
injury can also make content errors selecting and using the incorrect
tool with their left upper limb (callosal conceptual apraxia). Patients
with Alzheimer’s disease (AD) reveal anatomic evidence of callosal degeneration and the purpose of this study was to learn if patients with
AD have one or more forms of callosal apraxia.
Participants and Methods: Participants were 22 right handed patients with AD and 24 matched controls. Both upper limbs were tested
by having subjects pantomime transitive movements to command and
imitation. We also had them view pictures of an incomplete task and
asking them to pantomime the action needed to complete the task.
Results: When compared to controls the participants with AD demonstrated an ideomotor and conceptual apraxia of both upper limbs. They
also had a more severe ideomotor apraxia of their left than right hand.
Conclusions: These results suggest that patients with AD do have callosal disconnection apraxia.

A.K. HOLLAND, A. ROSA, C. BLANCO, M. DOSTER &
D.W. HARRISON. Reductions in Design Fluency and
Cardiovascular Regulation Vary Selectively as a Function of Trait
Hostility Level.
Objective: Right hemispheric functional cerebral systems are proposed
to be compromised in individuals with high levels of trait hostility (Holland, et al., 2012). For the current research, it is hypothesized that
high hostile individuals will evidence a reduced ability to regulate right
hemisphere cerebral systems relative to their low hostile counterparts
as measured through design fluency performance and regulation of
sympathetic tone.
Participants and Methods: High hostile (n=24) and low hostile
(n=21) undergraduates rating the Controlled Oral Word Association
Task (COWAT) as moderately to extremely difficult completed the
COWAT and the Ruff Figural Fluency Task (RFFT). Blood pressure
and heart rate (HR) measures were taken between each experimental
manipulation.
Results: A Hostile x Trial interaction for the number of unique designs produced was found (F(4, 176) = 2.73, p=.03), indicating that
high hostiles failed to produce the same number of unique designs on
the RFFT compared to their low hostile counterparts. This interaction
was not found for words produced on the COWAT (F(4, 176)=0.50,
p=0.74). A Condition x Trial interaction for (HR) was found (F(1,
43)=7.04, p=.01), indicating a reduction in HR after completion of the

Forty Fourth Annual INS Meeting Abstracts
COWAT and an increase in HR after completion of the RFFT. A Hostile x Condition interaction approaching significance was found (F(1,
43)=3.45, p=.07), indicating an increase in SBP in high hostiles after
completion of both tasks.
Conclusions: The Hostile x Trial interaction provides evidence that
high hostile individuals evidence reduced right hemisphere capacity
compared to their low hostile counterparts. The current results indicate
that functional cerebral systems may be especially compromised in high
hostiles when recruitment of right hemispheric cerebral resources are
required.

J.S. MILLER, A.H. PANOS, W.S. BROWN & L.K. PAUL. Adaptive
Skills in High-Functioning Adults with ACC and ASD.
Objective: Prior research has identified cognitive and behavioral similarities between high functioning persons with agenesis of the corpus
callosum (ACC) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD). However, adaptive functioning data in these populations is scarce. The purpose of
this study was to examine adaptive skills in high-functioning adults
with ACC and ASD in order to (1) forecast outcomes and (2) identify
similarities and differences.
Participants and Methods: Thirty adults with ACC (Mage = 28.70,
16-55; MFSIQ = 96, 78-129) and 24 adults with ASD (Mage = 30.38,
17-56; MFSIQ = 108, 92-133) completed the Adaptive Behavior Assessment System 2nd Edition: Self –Report Adult Form (ABAS-II). The
ABAS-II is an inventory that measures several adaptive skill areas with
age-referenced norms. Scores were compared between ACC and ASD,
and to norms.
Results: The ACC group scored significantly (p < .05) higher than
norms in Health and Safety, and similar to norms on all other composite
and skill areas. In contrast, the ASD group scored below expectation for
overall adaptive functioning based on the Global Adaptive Composite,
(GAC) as well as on Social, Practical, Conceptual composites, with the
largest effect size on Social (d = -2.40). The ASD group performed
significantly below expectation for most skill areas, including: Communication, Community Use, Functional Academics, Home Living, Leisure, Self-Care, Self-Direction, Social skills. Between ACC and ASD, the
ACC group scored significantly better on the GAC, Social, and Practical
composites as well as the following skill areas: Community Use, Home
Living, Health and Safety, Leisure, and Social skills.
Conclusions: High-functioning individuals with ACC perceived their
adaptive skills to be similar to neurotypical persons. However, those
with ASD reported skills to be considerably poorer than age-related
peers, and poorer than those with ACC. These findings are in support of
recent ASD studies that found normal intelligence was not an accurate
predictor of adaptive skill outcomes.

P. MOES, R. JAROH, E. MATTHEWS & E. KIM. Left Happy Female,
Right Angry Male: Hemisphere Differences in the Perception of
Gender and Emotion.
Objective: The study was designed to examine the lateralization of
gender perception in interaction with emotion perception and observer
gender. We hypothesized that female and male faces would be processed
most efficiently in the left and right hemispheres, respectively. In addition, happy and angry expressions would accentuate the female-left
and male-right advantage, respectively.
Participants and Methods: Experiment 1: Subjects (26 female, 30
male) responded to 200 msec. presentations of a face. Independent
variables were: male vs. female face; angry, happy, or neutral expression; visual field (LVF vs. RVF), and participant gender. Primary measures were RT and PC. Experiment 2: Subjects (16 female, 13 male)

5
responded to the same conditions as Exp. 1 except that faces were
presented centrally and the primary measure was P300 amplitude from
the ERP wave.
Results: Exp. 1: RT produced a strong field x face-gender interaction
[F(1,49)=40.1; p<.001] with left hemisphere-female and right hemisphere-male advantages. Angry facial expressions reduced the left hemisphere-female advantage, but accentuated the right-hemisphere-male
advantage [F(1,49)=25.3; p<.001]. PC data produced mixed results for
the lateralization of face-gender perception with neutral female faces
showing a significant left hemisphere advantage that was accentuated
with happy expressions.
Exp. 2: P300 (average amplitude) results at T3/T4 produced a 4-way
interaction [F(1,27)=5.3; p<.029] with female participants showing
higher amplitudes for left hemisphere-happy female, right hemisphere-angry male combinations. Males produced a stronger right
hemisphere response across conditions.
Conclusions: The results of both studies suggest an approach-related,
left hemisphere dominant response to happy-female faces and strong
avoidance-related right hemisphere response to angry male faces. These
results have implications for the evolutionary basis of gender-related
motivations as well as clinical and social consequences associated with
lateralized lesions.

K. OSWALD, M. WRIGHT & J. BO. Variability in Bimanual
Coordination Dependent on Strength of Hand Dominance.
Objective: Bimanual coordination is an essential human function requiring efficient interhemispheric communication to produce coordinated movements. Motor deficits affect a variety of clinical populations,
yet a complete understanding of bimanual coordination has yet to be
achieved. Previous research suggests completing bimanual tasks results
in less variability than unimanual tasks, or a bimanual advantage. Also,
strength of hand dominance has been shown to influence coordinated
performance. The present study sought to replicate evidence of a bimanual advantage, and it was predicted participants with strong hand
dominance would display a weaker bimanual advantage compared to
those with weak hand dominance.
Participants and Methods: Fifty-six young adults completed five finger taping conditions in a visually cued tapping paradigm: unimanual
left/right, bimanual in-phase, and left/right-lead out-of-phase. Hand
dominance was estimated using a self-report handedness questionnaire.
Results: Results generally revealed unimanual conditions resulted in
greater variability compared to the bimanual in-phase condition, supporting the presence of a bimanual advantage (P=0.002-0.036). Furthermore, results revealed that strong-handed individuals displayed a
strong bimanual advantage in both right hand (P=0.002) and left hand
(P=0.009) performance. An alternate pattern was observed in weakhanded participants, with weak-handed participants not displaying a
bimanual advantage in either right or left hand performance.
Conclusions: These results contradicted the proposed hypotheses and
suggest that strong hand dominance results in a more pronounced bimanual advantage compared to more stable performance across coordinated conditions as observed in those with weak handedness. In light
of the present findings, relevant studies, behavioral and neuroimaging,
are needed to gain further insight into bimanual coordination and the
underlying processes of motor movement.

T.A. RENTERIA-VAZQUEZ, C.H. KANG, M. GRAVES, L.K. PAUL
& W.S. BROWN. Social Inferences from Animated Interacting
Triangles in Agenesis of the Corpus Callosum: Labeled Topic
Modeling.
Objective: Individuals with agenesis of the corpus callosum (ACC) and
normal intelligence have deficits in social inference, but it is difficult to
objectively describe the deficit. This research used a text classification
approach (labeled topic modeling) to analyze differences in semantic
content of free-response descriptions of four theory-of-mind animations
involving two triangles interacting that normally elicit attributions of
mental states (coaxing, mocking, seducing, surprising; Castelli et al,
2002). It was hypothesized that topics characteristic of individuals with
ACC would not include themes reflecting attribution of mental and
emotional states.
Participants and Methods: Sixteen adults (age 20-51) with ACC
(FSIQ > 80) and 15 age-and FSIQ-matched controls (age 18-61) described what they saw in each animation. Labeled topic modeling extracted three topics from all participant responses for each animation:
one topic from each group (control and ACC) and a common topic.
Results: The control group’s topics included attributions of emotional
states (e.g. angry, happy, upset) that were not found in the ACC group.
Additionally, language reflecting the inference of animate agents occurred in topics from all animations for controls (e.g. male, female,
house, parent), but only one instance of this in individuals with ACC
(coaxing: mother, child). Both the control group and ACC group utilized words with goal directed intention for every animation, and both
utilized attribution of mental states and interaction between agents for
two animations.
Conclusions: Overall the hypothesis was supported in that the topics
from persons with ACC were not as likely as controls to include words
denoting emotional states or animate agents. Contrary to the hypothesis, the topics from the ACC group reflected attributions of intentional
mental states. However, it was evident that the controls used attributions
of mental states in a more sophisticated manner in that their topics
suggested intentional manipulation of another agent.

currently no research on the personality traits of individuals with ACC.
The objective of this study was to determine if a distinctive personality
profile exists for individuals with ACC.
Participants and Methods: The NEO-Five Factory Inventory (NEOFFI) was administered online to 17 individuals with ACC (age: 19-55;
FSIQ: 88-116) and to 24 age and IQ-matched controls (age: 19-64;
FSIQ: 98-115). Two multivariate analyses of variance assessed group
differences on the 5 personality dimensions and 13 personality trait
clusters.
Results: The multivariate effect was not significant between groups
when examining the 5 personality dimensions, F(5, 34) = 1.3, p = .42,
ηp2= .131. However, univariate tests revealed a tendency toward lower
Openness in the ACC group than in controls (ηp2 = .08). Groups did not
differ overall on the multivariate analysis of the 13 personality cluster
traits, F(13, 26) = 1.64, p = .14, ηp2= .45, but unvariate tests revealed
differences on 2 traits: less Unconventionality (ηp2 = .13) and greater
Prosocial Orientation (ηp2= .12) compared to controls.
Conclusions: The current results are consistent with parental reports
that individual’s with ACC do not cope well with change, and thus are
tend to be conventional. The high Prosocial Orientation score for the
ACC group should be considered in light of pervious research showing
that persons with ACC have diminished self-awareness. Thus, Brown

& Paul (2000) report that two adults with ACC studied intensively had
MMPI-2 profiles with large L-K differences, suggesting a tendency for
social and psychological nativity and rating themselves as highly positive. Otherwise, individuals with ACC were remarkable in Neuroticism,
Agreeableness, Conscientiousness, and Extraversion.

C. REID & A.M. FOX. Hemispheric Differences in Tb Responses
to Tone-pairs with Short and Long Interstimulus Intervals in
Children.
Objective: The asymmetric sampling in time hypothesis (AST) suggests
that the left and right secondary auditory areas function according to
different sampling rates. In adults, asymmetries in the Tb response, of
the T-complex AERP, to stimuli presented with different interstimulus
intervals (ISIs) reflect a rapid sampling rate (~20 Hz) in the left hemisphere and a slow sampling rate (~5 Hz) in the right hemisphere. As
significant changes in temporal processing occur between age 7 and
9, we investigated whether asymmetries consistent with the AST are
observable in children at age 7 and whether they become more pronounced at age 9. We predicted that Tb responses to the second tone of
tone-pairs with short ISIs would be enhanced over the left hemisphere
and Tb responses to the second tone of tone-pairs with long ISIs would
be enhanced over the right hemisphere.
Participants and Methods: Forty-two children attended a research
program at age 7 (22 male, 20 female; M = 7.5 years, SD = 0.27)
and were followed up at age 9 (M = 9.47, SD = 0.26). Children were
presented with tone-pairs, each composed of two 50 ms, 1000 Hz, sinusoidal tones separated by ISIs of 25, 50, 100, or 200 ms. Stimuli were
presented binaurally whilst the EEG was recorded.
Results: There was no significant effect of session on Tb responses.
Over the left hemisphere, Tb responses to 50 ms ISI tone-pairs were
enhanced relative to other tone-pairs. Over the right hemisphere, Tb
responses elicited by 100 and 200 ms ISI tone-pairs were enhanced
relative to other tone-pairs.
Conclusions: Our findings support the predictions of the AST. Auditory
areas of the left hemisphere preferentially respond to fast presentation
rates, and those of the right hemisphere preferentially respond to slow
presentation rates. Previous studies have observed hemispheric asymmetries in the processing of fast and slow speech modulations and our
findings suggest that hemispheric specialisation also occurs with the
processing of non-linguistic auditory stimuli, and are present during
childhood.

Inhibitory Control in Bilinguals with and without Musical
Training- A Pilot Study.
Objective: Event related potential (ERP) research has demonstrated
music training and bilingualism have differential effects on inhibitory
control (Moreno et al., 2014). Specifically, Moreno et al. found no behavioral differences between bilinguals, musicians, and controls, but
maximal N2 amplitudes and a more protracted P3 response for bilinguals. For the current pilot study, we aimed to 1) replicate these findings; and 2) expand this research by investigating if bilingual individuals
with musical training demonstrate further effects.
Participants and Methods: 9 monolingual non-musicians, 9 monolingual musicians, 9 bilingual non-musicians, and 9 bilingual musicians
(age range=18-25) completed a modified progressive matrices task, a

Forty Fourth Annual INS Meeting Abstracts
verbal fluency task, and a go/nogo ERP paradigm. FCz peak amplitude, latency, and difference waves for the N2, P3, and N2P3 complex
were calculated. Go versus nogo trials were examined using repeated
measures ANOVAs and group by condition interactions were examined
using one-way AONVAs
Results: There was a significant main effect for go and nogo trials for
the N2P3 complex (p=.000) and a trending main effect for N2 peak
amplitude (p=.075). The only significant between group differences was
found on a sensitivity index (d’), with bilingual musicians demonstrating
greatest sensitivity on the go/nogo task (p=.039).
Conclusions: While all groups showed the expected increase in the
N2P3 complex in response to nogo relative to go trials, this pilot study
did not replicate Moreno et al.’s findings. Group by condition differences
were not found for any ERP measures. We found behavioral differences
by adding a bilingual-musician group, who demonstrated the most response sensitivity on the go/nogo task. Although limited by sample size
(approx. half of Moreno et al.’s), results indicated a compounding effect
of bilingualism and music training may be found in a larger sample.
These results also support research indicating the N2P3 complex may a
better measure of inhibitory control (Falkenstein et al., 1999).

P. EGETO, T.J. ORNSTEIN & E.H. ABRAHAM. Behavioural and
EEG Indices of Conflict Monitoring.
Objective: Conflict monitoring (CM) is a cognitive function that regulates competing potential responses for a given situation and the subsequent execution of the winning response. Studies using electroencephalography (EEG) have linked the N2 component to CM; however,
there is no validated behavioural measure of CM. A few reports have
related reaction time (RT) with N2, though this association has not
been fully elucidated. We examined this link further by taking the RT
difference between two tasks, a choice RT task (Stop Signal Task, SST)
and a simple RT task (SRT), and comparing it with N2 magnitude. As
response selection is the main difference between these two tasks, we
reasoned that subtracting the RTs would better approximate CM after
“parsing out” common cognitive processes. We hypothesized that the
RT difference would provide a “purer” behavioural measure of CM and
would correlate with the magnitude of N2.
Participants and Methods: EEG data from 64 channels were recorded
from 25 healthy participants (mean age 32.8 [14.4]) during SST and
SRT performance. Peak (250-350ms post-stimulus) and mean (±24ms
around peak) amplitudes of N2 were obtained at the Fz, FCz and Cz
electrodes. Mean correct trial RT of the SST, as well as mean correct
SST RT minus SRT RT were correlated with the N2 measures.
Results: SST RT correlated with mean N2 amplitude at Fz (r=.-41,
p<.05). The RT difference measure had trending correlations with N2
means at Fz and Cz (both τ=.-27, p=.07). Other correlations ranged
between -0.07 to -0.29 (all p>.05).
Conclusions: Mean N2 amplitudes at Fz correlated best with both SST
and SST-SRT RT indices, indicating that longer conflict monitoring is
associated with a larger N2. Thus, this performance index may be a
viable behavioural measure of CM. Limitations include a small sample
size and under-refined EEG artifact processing methods. Future studies
can scrutinize this neural-behavioural association further.

Y. SUCHY. Distinct Effects of Neural Activation and Consistency
in Novelty Processing and Relations with IQ.
Objective: Effective performance in novel situations is a hallmark of
adaptive behavior, and shows promise as a marker of general cerebral
integrity. EEG studies have shown how novelty impairs the strength

7
and consistency of some neural responses, and how resilience to those
effects predicts higher cognitive functioning. Yet, the relations between
those phenomena are not well understood. This study aimed to clarify
how novelty impacts distinct neural response features and their relations with IQ.
Participants and Methods: Thirty-six healthy undergraduates completed assessments of intellectual ability as well as a complex motor
sequencing task during EEG recording. Contextual familiarity was
pseudo-randomly varied across four levels, while rare novel sequences
ensured task vigilance. Mean event-related-potentials (ERPs) quantified neural activation at left and right parieto-occipital electrodes from
200-600 milliseconds post-stimulus. Mean inter-trial phase clustering
(ITPC) quantified neural consistency at the same sensors and time range
from 1-3.9 hertz. Repeated measures ANOVAs tested effects of hemisphere and familiarity on ERPs and ITPC.
Results: Preliminary analyses of pre-stimulus activity showed stronger
preparatory activation in the left vs. right hemisphere (p = .008), but
no such effects for ITPC. Stimulus-evoked ERPs were larger following
novel vs. familiar contexts across hemispheres (p = .003) with no interaction, while ITPC increased from novel to familiar contexts in the
right hemisphere only (p < .001). Left but not right hemisphere ERPs
strongly predicted IQ across conditions (all rs = .53-.45, all ps ≤ .006),
whereas only familiar left ITPC predicted IQ (r = .34, p = .04).
Conclusions: The study findings suggest that novel contexts recruit
more neural resources yet impede their efficient recruitment. Lateralized
effects of novelty on right hemisphere ITPC, but left hemisphere preparatory activity and relations with IQ suggest that dissociable, lateralized
mechanisms may underlie behavioral novelty effects.

Counting Own Name -Clinical Robustness of Electrophysiology
in Assessing Residual Cognition in Disorders of Consciousness.
Objective: Event Related Potentials (ERPs) have shown promise in
detecting residual cognitive capacity without behavioral requirements
in patients with disorders of consciousness (DoC). Despite increased
knowledge of brain function in DoC from functional imaging and electrophysiological methods, their diagnostic utility at an individual patient
level remains to be established. This study investigated the robustness
of two active ERP tasks with different cognitive load.
Participants and Methods: Twenty patients in a minimally conscious
state (MCS; mean age = 40, 11 males, 13 traumatic brain injury, injury
onset range= 3,6-117 months), either showing (9 MCS+) or lacking (11
MCS-) behavioral response to command, were compared to 20 healthy
controls (mean age = 38, 10 males). Level of consciousness was established with the Coma Recovery Scale-Revised. The ERP-task included:
(1) active listening to change in pitch to subject`s own first name (SON)
repeated 100 times (SOA: 2 sec) and (2) active counting of SON (SON:
50 times), randomly interspersed between an unfamiliar name (UN: 50
times), both contrasted to a passive condition. Data was collected using a
32 electrodes cap and a portable NuAmp EEG- amplifier, epoched from
-200-1500 ms post stimulus-onset and analyzed with custom MATLAB
scripts in EEGLAB.
Results: The control group showed significantly larger P300 amplitudes
in the active counting of SON compared to listening to pitch. At an
individual level, all but one of the controls displayed enhanced P300 in
the counting task, while 9/20 patients (4 MCS+/5 MCS-) showed higher
P3 amplitudes in the active counting condition.
Conclusions: Of the two ERP tasks, active counting of SON constitutes
the most robust paradigm, and may reveal covert command following
in some MCS- patients who lack behavioral responses. However, the
task did not differentiate between the two MCS subgroups. Behavioral
and electrophysiological methods should thus be used in combination.

S. HERRERA, P. BUTLER, J. GORDON & V. ZEMON. Analysis of
Contrast Processing Deficits in Schizophrenia and Schizoaffective
Disorder Using Electrophysiological and Psychophysical
Measures.
Objective: Individuals with schizophrenia show deficits in visual processing, particularly to low levels of contrast. Contrast gain refers to the
rate of increase in response magnitude with increases in contrast, and
gain control refers to response adaptation as contrast increases. These
processes may be impaired in this disorder. The goal here was to explore
these deficits using a novel visual evoked potential (VEP) paradigm and
a psychophysical contrast sensitivity task.
Participants and Methods: 42 patients meeting DSM-IV criteria for
schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder and 59 healthy volunteers were
tested. Steady-state VEPs (ssVEPs) were elicited using hexagonal arrays
of dark dots (30’ diameter, 15’ interdot spacing) designed to match the
mosaic of retinal cells, swept in contrast from 1-32%, modulated on-off
at 10 Hz (targeting magnocellular-OFF cells). A nonlinear biophysical
model was fitted to response functions to assess contrast gain and gain
control. Participants performed a psychophysical task with horizontal
gratings at spatial frequencies from 0.5-21 cycles/deg to obtain contrast sensitivity functions. Mixed ANOVAs evaluated between-group
differences.
Results: ssVEPs (10 Hz frequency component) revealed reduced amplitudes, signal-to-noise ratios, and contrast gain in patients, but no
between-group differences in contrast gain control. The psychophysical
task revealed lower contrast sensitivities in patients across all spatial
frequencies.
Conclusions: Patients demonstrate impairments in processing low
contrast stimuli, particularly in contrast gain, as measured by the hexagonal-dot ssVEP paradigm and the psychophysical task. Basic visual
functions are typically not evaluated in patients with schizophrenia and
frequently go undetected. Further development of VEP techniques and
characterization of deficits may inform effects of low-level visual processing deficits on higher-level perceptual deficits, as well as contribute
to the development of biomarkers for schizophrenia.

Intentional Enhancement Of Electrocortical Responses To
Emotional Pictures By Parkinson Patients: Relation To Executive
Function.
Objective: Previous research has reported that non-demented Parkinson’s patients exhibit blunted physiologic reactivity to emotional stimuli
as indexed by startle eyeblink and electrophysiologic response (late positive potential, LPP). This blunted reactivity has been associated with apathy and worsening disease severity. The aim of this study was to learn
whether Parkinson’s patients could increase their emotional reactivity,
as measured by the LPP, using standard emotion regulation strategies.
We hypothesized that intentional up-regulation of emotional reactivity
by PD patients would be related to integrity of frontal-executive systems.
Participants and Methods: Participants included 20 PD and 14 ageand education-matched Controls. Event related potentials (LPP) were
recorded while participants viewed standard sets of unpleasant and
neutral pictures (IAPS) for 3 sec each. Each picture was preceded by a 3
sec cue to “look” at the subsequent picture or “increase” one’s emotional
reactivity to the picture. The PD and Control groups were not demented
or depressed based on cognitive and mood screening.
Results: The LPP was extracted from 400 -700 ms post-picture over
centroparietal sensors. Results of a repeated measures Group (PD, NC)
X Cue (look, increase) ANOVA resulted in a significant task main effect,

indicating greater amplitude LPP during the “increase” than “look”
cueing condition. No other significant effects were present. The LPP “increase” amplitude was predicted by Trails B Time and HVLT-delayed
recall in PD patients, and by scores on an anhedonia scale in Controls.
Conclusions: We found that PD patients could increase their electrocortical responses to pictures when cued, and this intentional enhancement was associated with scores on fronto-executive and memory
tasks. For Controls, the ability to upregulate reactivity depended on
levels of anhedonia, or loss of pleasure. Findings will be discussed in
terms of treatment approaches for apathy in PD. Support provided by

Neurophysiological Marker of Attention Switching Advantages in
Bilinguals: A Pilot Study.
Objective: The ability to switch between languages is thought to enhance specific executive function (EF) mechanisms, resulting in a ‘bilingual advantage.’ However, evidence from the young adult literature
on the bilingual advantage is mixed. This may be attributed to either
the EF maturity peak in early adulthood, or to the fact that the current
measurement methods (e.g., reaction time, accuracy) are not sensitive
enough to pick up subtle differences between groups. We assessed a
neurophysiological marker of attention switching (i.e., P300) to examine
if early bilinguals demonstrate advantaged neural processing over both
late bilinguals and monolinguals in a young adult population.
Participants and Methods: A subset of 30 undergraduates (Mage =
20.67, SD = 1.63, 73% women) from a larger ongoing study was selected
for analysis. These participants completed a language history questionnaire and several tasks including a computerized switch task, which
served to elicit the P300. The sample was separated into three groups:
early bilinguals who learned two languages before age six (n=10); late
bilinguals who learned a second language after age 12 (n=10); and
monolinguals (n=10).
Results: Participants performed similarly on the matrices and letter
fluency tasks. Measured at site CPz, a repeated measures ANOVA revealed a significant main effect of trial type (Switch vs. Preswitch), F(1,
27) = 9.16, p < 0.01, such that the peak P300 for switch trials were
larger. An Trial X Group interaction approached significance, F(2, 27)
= 2.41, p = 0.109.
Conclusions: Despite a small sample size, the pilot study is capturing
differential processing during switch and nonswitch conditions. More
interestingly, the current pilot study suggests trends towards differences
between early bilinguals, late bilinguals, and monolinguals. These trends
in attention switching differences in bilinguals will be further elucidated
with ongoing data collection and shed light on the elusive nature of EF
advantages in bilingual young adults.

A Neurophysiological Marker of Inhibition in Bilinguals: A Pilot
Study.
Objective: Executive functions (EFs) such as inhibiting, switching and
updating working memory have become relevant targets for the bilingual advantage. In particular, inhibitory control (IC) is necessary to
supress the nontarget language during language production. Findings
from studies that compare the EFs of bilingual and monolingual young
adults have been inconclusive. Using ERPs, we focused on IC using a
traditional go/no-go paradigm to elicit the N2, serving to determine
whether a subtle bilingual advantage exists in young adults.
Participants and Methods: A subsample of 30 undergraduate students
(Mage = 20.23; 67% female) was selected from a larger ongoing study of
EF and bilingualism. There were groups: Early bilinguals, who learned a

Forty Fourth Annual INS Meeting Abstracts
second language before the age of six (n=10), late bilinguals who learned
a second language after the age of 12 (n=10), and monolinguals (n=10).
Participants completed a few questionnaires and several tasks, including
a modified Progressive Raven’s Matrices task, a verbal fluency task, and
a computerized go/no-go task. Percentage of correct no-go trials and
peak N2 amplitudes were measured.
Results: Control and behavioural measures showed no significant
differences between groups, suggesting similar nonverbal intelligence,
verbal fluency, inhibition accuracy. A repeated measures ANOVA revealed a trend towards larger N2 peaks on no-go trials than go trials
(p = 0.066). Peak N2 results showed no significant difference between
groups (p=0.680).
Conclusions: Although mean peak N2 amplitudes for early bilinguals
were largest, there may not have been enough statistical power to reveal
such differences; on-going data collection will shed light on this. These
results could also be related to using an N2 peak amplitude measure.
As such, other ways of measuring IC, such as base-to-peak N2 and the
N2/P3 complex, may be more sensitive measures of IC and will be investigated in future evaluations. Alternatively, these preliminary results
may suggest evidence against the bilingual advantage for IC.

correlate with working memory performance: resting state MEG
study.
Objective: Working memory (WM) is the ability to manipulate information on items kept in short-term memory. In this study, we used
resting state magnétoencephalography (MEG) oscillations to predict
the performance in verbal (VWM) and visuospatial (SWM) working
memory tasks.
Participants and Methods: We recorded resting state MEG and administered the WM Index from the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale – 4th
edition (WAIS-IV) and the Spatial Addition subtest from the Wechsler
Memory Scale - 4th edition (SA/WMS-IV) to assess WM performance
in 18 participants (6 males and 12 females; mean= 26.5 years, SD=
3.98 years). We calculated means of Power Spectrum Density for different frequency bands (delta, 1-4Hz; theta, 4-8Hz; alpha, 8-13Hz;
beta, 13-30-Hz; gamma1, 30-59Hz; gamma2, 61-90Hz; gamma3, 90120Hz) and correlated MEG power normalized for the maximum in each
frequency band at the sensor level with WM performance. The other
WAIS-IV indexes were used to assess the specificity of the correlations.
The sensors showing a significant correlation were grouped by using a
cluster algorithm and corrected for multiple comparisons.
Results: We found positive correlations between both types of WM
performance and clusters in the bilateral posterior and right fronto-temporal regions for the delta band (r2=0.73), in the fronto-middle line and
right temporal regions for the theta band (r2=0.63) as well as in the
parietal regions for the alpha band (r2=0.78). VWM and SWM shared
a common fronto-parietal cluster of sensors but also showed clusters
specific to each modality. We also demonstrated that the right parietal
posterior clusters for slow oscillations (delta to beta band) were specific
to WM, as compared to those obtained for the other WAIS-IV indexes.
Conclusions: Slow frequencies (1-13Hz) especially in the delta and
theta bands (1-8Hz) recorded at rest with MEG predicted WM performance. Cluster topography was consistent with the implication of a
fronto-parietal network in WM.

Electrophysiological Signature of Selective Auditory Attention.
Objective: Many studies of auditory selective attention have demonstrated enhancement of traditional evoked responses to rare target stimulus events (oddballs) embedded in a slow-paced stream of frequent
stimulus events. Few studies have examined the effects of selective
attention in modulating neural responses to a continuous dynamically-changing auditory stream. We therefore used a novel steady-state
auditory response (SSAR) variant of the traditional “oddball” paradigm
to examine attentional modulations of neural responses to an on-going,
rapidly-varying acoustic stream.
Participants and Methods: Responses were recorded to rapid (50 ms)
pulsed frequency modulations (PFMs) of a continuous tone in 56 normal
hearing adults. In an “auditory attend” condition, listeners attended to
and counted the occurrence of brief intermittent epochs (oddball events)
where the PFMs changed direction. In the “visual attend” condition,
listeners heard the same auditory signal but were instructed to attend
to targets in a concurrent visual continuous performance task.
Results: Multicomponent transient evoked-responses (MTER’s) evident following onset of oddball events were substantially larger in the
auditory compared to the visual attend condition. SSARs to PFMs
and MTERs following offset of oddball events showed no condition
differences.
Conclusions: SSARs to PFMs were not influenced by attention, suggesting they were pre-attentive in nature. By contrast, the onset MTER was
highly influenced by attention. The pattern of dissociation of attentional
effects on SSARs and MTERs suggests that the onset MTER is not simply
attributable to the frequency deviations but is a neural marker reflecting
overt target recognition. The latency, duration and scalp distribution
of this response did not correspond to known traditional transient responses. Its attributes and some preliminary findings suggest it could be
a clinically useful index of auditory attentional processing.

F. STEFFEN-ALLEN, R.P. SO & C.A. CHEN. Modulation of Neural
Oscillation as a Function of Time During Successful Working
Memory Performance In Schizophrenia.
Objective: Working memory (WM) impairment is a core cognitive deficit in schizophrenia and has been linked to dysfunction in the gamma,
alpha, and theta bands. However, successful WM performance in patients is less well characterized. This study aims to investigate modulation of the EEG signal during successful WM performance in schizophrenia and to examine how that modulation differs from controls.
Participants and Methods: Patients with schizophrenia (n=7) and
controls (n=9) had scalp EEG recorded during a modified Sternberg
WM task with two difficulty levels. The task was subdivided into four
stages (pre-trial baseline, encoding, retention, and probe). Task-induced
amplitudes were computed for the gamma, beta, alpha, theta, and delta
frequency bands for three midline electrodes (Fz, Cz, and Oz). Averaged
amplitudes were then computed in 14, one-second steps across the task
for each participant. Repeated measures ANOVAs were conducted for
each frequency band.
Results: Diagnosis did not predict WM performance. Additionally,
patients and controls showed similar patterns of modulation in all frequency bands except delta. In delta, patients showed greater modulation
in the delta band than controls, with increasing modulation when moving back across the midline axis (F(2.34, 32.78) = 3.26, p = .004). In
the beta and gamma bands, task difficulty was found to be an important
factor in modulation patterns, such that greater power was associated
with increased difficulty in gamma (F(2.51, 35.15) = 3.26, p = .040)
but with decreased difficulty in beta (F(3.51, 49.08) = 3.50, p = .017).
Conclusions: While recent studies have suggested the importance of
compensatory mechanisms to enable successful WM performance in
schizophrenia, this study indicates that such strategies may not always
be necessary for successful performance. Additionally, modulation of

10
the neural signal over time may be affected by the difficulty of the task
involved, indicating the need to consider difficulty when studying WM
performance in schizophrenia.

Induced Neurophysiological and Neurochemical Changes in
Healthy Controls: A Translational Model Using Simultaneous
Imaging Modalities.
Objective: Evidence from animal models supports the role of GABA and
glutamate/glutamine (Glx) in coordinating neural oscillations, both of
which are disrupted in schizophrenia and are thought to underlie higher
order cognitive functions. The present study used magnetic resonance
spectroscopy (MRS) and EEG modalities simultaneously during acute
ketamine, an NMDAR antagonist, injection in healthy participants to
analyze the temporal relationship between neurochemical pathways
(GABA and Glx measures via MRS) and neural oscillations (power
measures via EEG).
Participants and Methods: MRS measurements and MR-compatible
EEG recordings were collected simultaneously before, during, and following the ketamine (0.5 mg/kg) intravenous infusion (i.e., six 15-minutes blocks). GABA and Glx levels of the medial prefrontal cortex and
neural oscillatory powers of different frequency bands (i.e., delta: 0.5-4
Hz, theta: 4-8 Hz, alpha: 8-12 Hz, beta: 14-28 Hz, and gamma: 30-58
Hz) were obtained at rest in healthy participants (N = 11, aged 18-55).
Results: GABA and Glx increased to a maximum from baseline 15-30
minutes following ketamine infusion. This increase was significant for
GABA (paired-samples t-test, p = 0.039). As hypothesized, average
gamma power significantly increased following ketamine injection,
peaking within 15 minutes (repeated-measures ANOVAs, p values <
0.05 for both left and right frontal electrodes, F3 and F4). Additionally,
average delta power of left frontal electrode decreased in a linear fashion
following infusion (repeated-measures ANOVA, p = 0.011; polynomial
of degree 1, p = 0.003).
Conclusions: In the absence of a cognitive task, elevations in gamma
power might represent the physiological correlate of the symptoms of
schizophrenia. Increases in gamma power preceded increases in GABA
and Glx, which provides preliminary support for a feedback mechanism.
Our results are consistent with animal studies, supporting the translation
of animal findings to humans.

M. ZUPANC & J. LIN. Age of Diagnosis Impacts Lateralization
Profile in Pediatric Focal Epilepsy.
Objective: Epilepsy surgery has significantly increased in recent years.
More research is needed to investigate neuropsychological implications
for surgery. Pediatric patients demonstrate a more generalized pattern
of impairments, instead of hemisphere-specific deficits found more
commonly among adults. Additional research is needed to determine
the age-related factors that impact lateralization, which will assist with
interpretation of neuropsychological profiles for surgery.
Participants and Methods: Participants between the ages of 4-20
years-old (m=12.19, SD=4, 42.9% male) with a diagnosis of focal
epilepsy completed a neuropsychological evaluation for clinical care.
Participants had temporal (N=34) or frontal lobe (N=32) epilepsy or
lateralization in the left (N=45) or right (N=33) hemisphere. Stepwise
regression was conducted to examine the following outcomes: motor
and language dominance. Z transformations of difference scores were
calculated. Predictors were age at diagnosis and evaluation. Separate

regression analyses were run based on localization of seizure focus and
lateralization of hemisphere.
Results: Left motor dominance in frontal lobe epilepsy was predicted
by age of diagnosis (B=.19, p<.05), but not age at evaluation (B=.02,
ns). For those with left hemisphere epilepsy, age of diagnosis was a
significant predictor of stronger nonverbal IQ lateralization (B=-.07,
p<.05), accounting for approximately 11% of the variance. Stronger
lateralization was evident as age of diagnosis increased. For temporal
and right hemisphere epilepsy, however, predictors were nonsignficant.
Conclusions: Results indicate that focal findings on neuropsychological testing may be best predicted by age of diagnosis rather than age
at evaluation. Older age at diagnosis predicts stronger lateralization
findings, an important factor for presurgical evaluations. Further evidence is provided for sensitive periods of development, particularly for
motor and language skills, and the impact of specific types of epilepsy
on such development.

White Matter Correlates of Verbal Memory Explored with DTI in
Temporal Lobe Epilepsy.
Objective: The structure-function relationships between memory processing and underlying white matter circuitry remain unclear. We used a
presumed measure of white matter integrity, fractional anisotropy (FA),
to explore verbal memory correlates in participants with left temporal
lobe epilepsy (LTLE), right TLE (RTLE), and controls. We hypothesized that the LTLE group would have the lowest FA of the three groups
in the left TL along the fornix (FX), uncinate fasciculus (UF), and
parahippocampal cingulum (PHC), and predicted relationships between
these diffusion measures and memory performance.
Participants and Methods: Probabilistic tractography was applied
to diffusion-weighted images of 29 participants with LTLE (mean
age=37.82, SD=13.26; 65% female), 24 with RTLE (mean age=40.53,
SD=11.44; 60% female) and 20 controls (mean age=37.82, SD=13.26;
65% female) along the FX, UF, PHC, and corticospinal tract (CST; control tract). RAVLT (word list/episodic recall), Boston Naming (confrontation naming/semantic recall), and Grooved Pegboard (control task)
were obtained from the TLE groups. Bivariate correlations examined
the relationships between measures.
Results: Tractography defined tracts for all participants. PHC FA in
the LTLE group (M=0.34, SD=0.10) did not differ significantly from
the RTLE group (M=0.32, SD=0.09), but was lower compared to controls (M=0.38, SD=0.04), t(40) = 4.75, p=.035. The RTLE group also
had lower PHC FA than controls, t(36) = 9.12, p=.005. There was a
positive correlation between PHC FA and episodic recall in the LTLE
group, r(21)=.44, p=.047. There was no relationship between PHC FA
and the control task.
Conclusions: Consistent with literature suggesting white matter differences in TLE, both TLE groups demonstrated lower FA in a major left
temporal tract (PHC) compared to controls. Unexpectedly, the LTLE
group did not demonstrate lower FA than the RTLE group. PHC FA
was related to episodic memory performance in LTLE groups.

Aicardi Syndrome: A Case Report of a Well Developing 15 Year Old.
Objective: Aicardi Syndrome is a rare neurologic disorder characterized
by infantile spasms, complete or partial agenesis of the corpus callosum,
and chorioretinal lacunae. The syndrome occurs almost exclusively in
females and manifests with profound developmental delays in cognitive and motor skills. The objective is to share clinical data of Aicardi
Syndrome collected over 14 years at Massachusetts General Hospital.

Forty Fourth Annual INS Meeting Abstracts
Participants and Methods: This is a 15-year old girl with Aicardi
Syndrome who initially presented with infantile spasms at 3 months and
treated with Vigabatrin since that time. She has agenesis of the corpus
callosum with a small area of the genu intact, and small, scattered
chorioretinal lacunae in the peripapillary area. She has been followed
clinically for 14 years with neurological and neuropsychological exams
and received intensive applied behavior analysis (ABA) since she was
4 years old.
Results: Up to age 3, the patient presented as social, interacting with
others, smiling and engaged. By age 4, she developed self-injurious
behaviors, became perseverative and received a diagnosis of Autism.
Periodic neuropsychological exams revealed consistent developmental
delays. At her most recent evaluation (age 15) she had vocabulary skills
of an 8-year old and fluid reasoning of a 5-year old. Her adaptive
self-care skills were equivalent to an 8 year old. Her motor skills were
equivalent to a 7-year-old level
Conclusions: While our patient continues to have partial complex seizures, developmental delays with autism and behavioral difficulties, her
skill level reflects unusually good development in contrast to others with
Aicardi Syndrome. This may be due to one or more factors including
her early and intensive ABA treatment, early intervention with Vigabatrin, or small chorioretinal lacunae not often seen in Aicardi Syndrome.
Exploring these factors may improve our understanding of behavioral
outcomes in Aicardi Syndrome.

J. FACELLA-ERVOLINI, L. SEPETA, A. MARTIN, S. STEWART,
W. GAILLARD & M. BERL. Functional Significance of
Hippocampal Abnormalities in Pediatric Focal Epilepsy.
Objective: Hippocampal pathology occurs in children with epilepsy,
including mesial temporal sclerosis (MTS) and hippocampal shape/
position abnormalities. To our knowledge, the functional significance
of various hippocampal abnormalities (HA) has not been studied in
pediatric focal epilepsy. We examined memory functioning in children
with focal epilepsy with and without HA, as well as typically developing
controls.
Participants and Methods: Forty children with focal epilepsy and 20
controls (Age=11.5±3.8) underwent neuropsychological testing. Twenty
children with focal epilepsy had HA (10 L, 9 R, 1 B; Age=11.6±4.3);
20 had normal hippocampi (10 L, 9 R, 1 B; Age=11.5±4.0). Twelve
children with HA had MTS; eight had abnormalities such as globular or malrotated hippocampi. Measures included Children’s Memory
Scale Dot Location (CMS-DL) and California Verbal Learning Test
(CVLT-C). Measures were transformed to normative z-scores. Group
differences were examined with two multivariate analyses of covariance (MANCOVA) models with 1) overall memory score (CVLT-C
List A Total Trials, CMS-DL Total) or 2) long delay free recall score
(CVLT-C Long Delay Free Recall (LDFR), CMS-DL Long Delay) as
between-group factors. IQ was used as a covariate due to group differences (p=0.001).
Results: No main effect of group across memory measures for overall
memory scores was found. However, for long delay free recall, we found
a main effect of group across memory measures (p<0.05). Posthoc analyses revealed group differences for CMS-DL long delay (p< 0.05) and a
trend on CVLT-C LDFR (p=0.06). Specifically, for CMS-DL long delay,
patients with HA performed lower than patients without (p<0.05); there
was a trend on CVLT-C LDFR for patients with HA to perform lower
than controls (p=0.06).
Conclusions: Our results suggest that HA in pediatric focal epilepsy
affects memory performance, particularly long delay free recall. These
results demonstrate the functional significance of HA, which is particularly important in presurgical epilepsy evaluation.

H. FERNANDO & M.J. HAMBERGER. Medication and Executive
Function in Temporal Lobe Epilepsy.
Objective: Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) is often associated with impairment in functions mediated by extratemporal brain regions, presumably, due to remote effects of temporal lobe abnormalities. Antiepileptic
drugs (AEDs) have also been shown to reduce cognitive functioning,
with polytherapy associated with greater dysfunction, particularly in
executive functioning. However, this work has failed to consistently
control for other potential contributors such as disease severity and level
of intelligence. We aimed to examine the effect of both of these factors
on a broad range of executive functions.
Participants and Methods: Participants were 78 adults with TLE,
(mean age=41.6, SD=14.0). 61 patients were on monotherapy (78.2%)
while 17 patients took >=3 AEDs (21.8%). Tests included Wisconsin Cart Sorting Test (WCST), Trail Making (TMT), Digits Forward
(DSF) & Backward (DSB), Boston Naming Test (BNT), Controlled Oral
Word Association Test (COWAT), DKEFS Color-Word Interference and
Wechsler scale IQ. Seizure frequency served as a marker of disease
severity. T tests, Pearson correlations and regression analyses assessed
the relation between AEDs and cognitive performance.
Results: Seizure frequency was unrelated to test performance. The
polytherapy group performed significantly lower than monotherapy
patients on DSF [t(76)=-4.29, p<.01], DSB [t(76)=-3.81, p<.01],
COWAT [t(74)=-2.33, p<.05], Trails B [t(76)=-2.62, p<.05], DKEFS
color naming [t(53)=-2.59, p<.01], word naming [t(53)=-3.55, p<.01],
inhibition [t(53)=-2.02, p<.05], and switching [t(53)=-2.02, p<.05].
However, when controlling for IQ, number of AEDS predicted only
lower DSF [F(1, 72) = 6.63, p<.05], DSB [F(1, 72) = 5.56, p<.05],
and DKEFS word naming [F(1, 51) = 5.15, p<.05].
Conclusions: When controlling for IQ, the effect of AEDs was limited
to select measures of attention and working memory. Results suggest
some increased risk for cognitive dysfunction with AED polytherapy, yet
emphasize the importance of controlling for relevant variables.

M. FISCHER, S. JACOB, M.M. FIUMEDORA, C. BIGRAS &
P. SHEAR. Everyday Working Memory Function in Temporal
Lobe Epilepsy.
Objective: Memory deficits are the most common subjective complaint
in patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). In addition to their memory dysfunction, these patients are often found to exhibit executive functioning (EF) deficits. To date, EF studies have focused on laboratory
measures of working memory (WM) and have rarely included self-report
measures of EF in everyday functioning. This study was designed to
address the degree to which adults with TLE endorse WM deficits and
how this self-report corresponds to laboratory measures of WM and
declarative memory.
Participants and Methods: Participants were 25 unilateral (19 left
TLE; 6 right TLE) patients with refractory epilepsy seen for presurgical evaluations. They had a mean age of 34.8 (SD = 12.4) and had
completed a mean of 13.8 years of education (SD = 2.2). All participants completed a self-report measure of EF (BRIEF-A) and laboratory measures of verbal and nonverbal learning and memory (CVLT-II,
BVMT-R) and working memory (WAIS-IV WMI subtests).
Results: The patients on average endorsed WM deficits that were significantly more severe than any other aspect of EF measured by the
BRIEF-A (p<.05 for all comparisons); 60% of patients had clinically
elevated WM scores. Poorer BRIEF-A WM was significantly associated
with greater deficits in verbal (but not nonverbal) immediate and delayed recall (p<.05). BRIEF-A WM reductions were associated with
performance decrements on the WAIS-IV Digit Span but not other WMI
subtests. Multiple regression showed that Digit Span and CVLT total
learning made significant (p<.05) and near-significant (p<.06) independent contributions to the prediction of BRIEF-A WM.

12
Conclusions: Patients with TLE reported clinically significant and
disproportionately severe WM deficits relative to other aspects of EF, a
pattern consistent with data in the BRIEF-A manual from a small heterogeneous sample of epilepsy patients. The data also suggest that verbal
list learning predicts aspects of BRIEF-A WM that are independent of
attention and concentration.

M. BERL & L. KENWORTHY. Parent-Reported Comorbidities in
Youth with ASD and Epilepsy without Intellectual Disability.
Objective: Individuals with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) have
higher rates of epilepsy than the general population. Some studies report that seizures in youth with ASD are related to intellectual disability
(ID) rather than ASD. There is no previous research studying youth with
ASD and epilepsy without ID. The purpose of this study was to assess
comorbidities of youth with ASD and epilepsy without ID (group AE)
and compare them to: youth with epilepsy (group E) and youth with
ASD (group A).
Participants and Methods: Variables were compared across groups
using chi-square analyses for categorical variables and one-way Analysis
of Variance (ANOVA) for continuous variables. Participants received a
measure of overall cognitive functioning. Parents completed the Child
Behavior Checklist (CBCL) and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder
(ADHD) Rating Scale-IV.
Results: 42 parents completed questionnaires and there were 14 participants in each group who were matched for age (M=11.4, SD=3.5 in
AE group), sex (11 males, 3 females), and IQ (M=89.1, SD=19.8 in AE
group). ANOVA results found significant findings for the CBCL ADH
and Oppositional Defiant (OD) Problems. Post-hoc tests revealed that
group A had greater ADH and OD Problems than group E. In addition,
group AE had greater OD Problems than group E. There was also a
significant finding on the ADHD Rating Scale-IV Hyperactivity Score.
Post-hoc tests revealed that group AE had greater hyperactivity than
group E. Comparison of the percentages from each group with elevated
scores on measures found significant differences on the CBCL ADH and
OD Problems.
Conclusions: Although we thought the burden of ASD and epilepsy
would yield greater comorbidities, group A had the highest scores and
was not different from group AE, but both had more hyperactivity and
oppositional behavior than group E. One possibility for this finding
is the behavioral regulatory effects of some antiepileptic medications.
Further exploration of comorbidities is warranted to better understand
this population.

J.P. HARP & A.J. ANDERSON. Neuropsychological Differential
Diagnosis of Posterior Perivetricular Nodular Heterotopia: A Case
Study.
Objective: Periventricular nodular heterotopia (PNH) is a neurodevelopmental disorder often related to Filamin A gene mutation (FLNA).
This results in poor neural migration, manifesting in epilepsy with mild
cognitive impairment in females and spontaneous abortion or early
death in males. Recent research identified some PNH patients without
FLNA mutation, dubbed posterior PNH. Typical presentation includes
asymmetric ventricular nodules and cerebellar, hippocampal, and colpocephalic malformations (Mandelstam et al., 2013). Unlike PNH-FLNA,
posterior PNH exhibits no sex-based differences, but is often accompanied by cognitive impairment and epilepsy. This presentation discusses
the pathophysiology of PNH and illustrates a typical case of posterior
PNH condition seen in clinic.

Participants and Methods: A 22-year-old, left-handed,
Ukrainian-American male university student presented with refractory
epilepsy and practical cognitive difficulties. Seizures appeared with fever
at age 9 and persisted, usually absence with occasional falls. Imaging
revealed bilateral PNH, cerebellar dysgenesis, reduced cortical volume,
and possible mesial temporal sclerosis.
Results: Examination revealed forward-tilting posture; tremulous upper
face; vague, slowed speech; and spatial disorientation. Data revealed
borderline impaired IQ and deficits often observed with periventricular lesions, such as generalized slowing and significantly weaker visuospatial than verbal performances. Additional impairments included
encoding and retrieval, naming, verbal fluency, mental flexibility, and
construction. Close examination of imaging revealed primarily posterior, asymmetric nodules accompanied by multiple pathognomonic
abnormalities.
Conclusions: Imaging and neuropsychological testing led to diagnosis
of posterior PNH. Patient was deemed a poor surgical candidate due
to non-localized seizure focus. This rather typical presentation of an
unusual disorder provides differential diagnostic value with implications
for treatment planning in posterior PNH.

E. HERMANS, M. HENDRIKS, P. OSSENBLOK, S. DASELAAR,
P. HOFMAN, A. COLON & N. FRANKENMOLEN. Memory and
fMRI Activation in Temporal Lobe Epilepsy: Towards Predicting
Surgery Outcome.
Objective: Surgical treatment in patients with temporal lobe epilepsy
(TLE) involves the risk of post-surgical memory decline. Lateralization
or even localization of memory networks preoperatively, may minimize
postoperative risk. We developed a fMRI face-name memory task and
performed a feasibility study. We investigated three aims. First, the
task should provoke hippocampal activation. Second, this hippocampal
activation should demonstrate memory reallocation in TLE patients.
Third, this hippocampal activation should associate with performance
on standard pre-surgical memory tests.
Participants and Methods: 31 Epilepsy surgery candidates with TLE
and 10 control subjects performed the task. They were instructed to
memorize combinations of faces and names during MRI scanning. Individual Lateralization Indices (LI), defined as the relative difference in
the number of activated voxels in the left and right hippocampus, were
calculated. These results were correlated with patients performances on
classical neuropsychological memory tests as part of their pre-surgical
evaluation.
Results: The fMRI face-name task provoked hippocampal activation
in both epilepsy patients and control subjects. Left TLE patients with
hippocampal sclerosis (LI: M=-0.19, SD=0.28) showed more right over
left hippocampal activation and right TLE patients with hippocampal
sclerosis (LI: M=0.14, SD=0.26) showed more left over right hippocampal activation (t(7)=1.91, p< .05, 1-tailed). There were strong and
significant associations between the LI and non-verbal memory performance (r=.89, p< .01) in right TLE patients. More right over left
hippocampal activation in right TLE patients corresponds to better
non-verbal memory.
Conclusions: There are multiple indications that the fMRI face-name
task we used may be a valuable tool in the pre-surgical evaluation of
epilepsy patients. A final evaluation and validation should include more
patients and data on actual post-surgical memory outcome.

Symptoms of Inattention and Hyperactivity/Impulsivity in
Pediatric Epilepsy.
Objective: Previous research demonstrates that approximately 30% of
children with epilepsy meet criteria for Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity
Disorder (ADHD), most commonly the inattentive subtype. The specific

Forty Fourth Annual INS Meeting Abstracts
manifestations of ADHD symptomatology and their etiology in pediatric
epilepsy are not well delineated. The current study examined ratings of
inattention and hyperactivity for children with epilepsy.
Participants and Methods: Neuropsychological and demographic data
for 131 children with epilepsy (mean age: 10.1 years; 57% male) were
extracted from a large clinical database. For comparison, data were also
extracted for 131 age/gender matched children with ADHD. Overall
parent ratings and specific item endorsements on the ADHD Rating
Scale-IV were analyzed within and between groups.
Results: Parents of the Epilepsy group (EPI) endorsed more items on
the inattention (IA) than the hyperactivity/impulsivity (HI) subscale.
Overall, the EPI group was rated at the 70th percentile on the HI and
the 84th on the IA subscales. The most frequently endorsed IA items
were attention to detail (62%), easily distracted (60%), and difficulty
organizing (58%).
In comparison, children in the ADHD group were rated at the 83rd
percentile on the HI and the 90th on the IA subscales, which was significantly higher than the EPI group on both subscales (p<.05). More
specifically, the mean ratings for the ADHD group were significantly
higher across all 9 HI and 4 of 9 IA items (p<.05). There were 5 specific
HI and 3 IA items that were statistically more likely to be elevated in
the ADHD group (p<.05).
Conclusions: Consistent with prior research, children with epilepsy
were more likely to demonstrate symptoms of inattention than hyperactivity/impulsivity. While children with ADHD had higher symptom
ratings on both inattention and hyperactivity/impulsivity, specific items
were differentially endorsed across groups. The ADHD Rating Scale-IV
may help characterize specific symptoms of inattention and inform
treatment planning in children with epilepsy.

S.N. JACOB, A. REEDY, S. HASLON, Q. MANO, D.M. FICKER &
P. SHEAR. Memory and Coping in Patients with Epilepsy.
Objective: The goal of this study was to investigate the relationship
between cognitive functioning and the strategies that individuals with
epilepsy use to cope with stress. We hypothesized that the memory
dysfunction many of these patients experience would predict decreased
use of problem focused engagement and increased use of disengagement
coping approaches.
Participants and Methods: Participants were 37 individuals (mean age
= 39.95) who had EEG-confirmed diagnosis of epilepsy. Exclusionary
criteria included history of a current and progressive neurologic disorder
other than epilepsy; bipolar or psychotic disorder; current substance
use disorder; serious developmental disability; or verified non-epileptic
seizures. Participants completed neuropsychological measures of verbal
(CVLT-2) and visual (BVMT-R) memory, as well as a self-report measure of coping strategies in response to life stressors (Coping Strategies
Inventory – Short Form).
Results: Multiple regression analyses revealed that poorer visual and
verbal learning and memory each predicted significantly increased use
of emotion focused engagement (EFE) and problem focused disengagement (PFD) coping (p < .05), even after controlling for common
demographic predicators of coping (age and gender), as well as disease
duration. Memory did not predict problem focused engagement or emotion focused disengagement coping.
Conclusions: The present study demonstrates that those with poorer
verbal and visual memory functioning are significantly more likely to
cope with life stressors by employing EFE coping strategies, such as
relying on social support and expressing their feelings, and PFD strategies, such as avoiding thinking about the stressful situation or using
wishful thinking. The findings are consistent with a small literature
demonstrating that cognitive ability is related to coping across multiple
clinical populations and have implications for treatment interventions
that aim to help patients employ effective coping strategies.

Distinct Patterns of Younger versus Older Seizure Onset in
Individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorders.
Objective: Seizures frequently occur within a bimodal distribution in
autism spectrum disorders (ASDs), yet limited information is available
regarding the clinical profile of older versus younger onset and the association of seizure-related variables to adaptive functioning.
Participants and Methods: 30 children, adolescents, and adults with
an ASD and a history of seizures were recruited through a large statewide ASD research registry. Participants had a community diagnosis
of ASD or meet criteria for autism on the Autism Diagnostic Observation Scheduled – 2nd edition (ADOS-2). Seizure-related variables
were obtained from a parent-report epilepsy questionnaire. Adaptive
functioning was assessed with the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales2nd Edition Survey (VABS-II).
Results: A series of multiple regression analyses examined the influence
of epilepsy-related variables on adaptive functioning. Older age of onset
and greater amount of anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs) were associated with
poorer adaptive functioning. A greater amount of failed AED’s was
associated with poorer adaptive functioning in a younger seizure onset
group (< 8 years), yet a more severe lifetime seizure status and older age
at onset were associated with poorer adaptive functioning in an older
seizure onset group. The older seizure onset group showed significantly
poorer social skills and a higher rate of generalized tonic-clonic seizures,
while the younger group showed a higher rate of other generalized seizures and lifetime daily seizures.
Conclusions: Later age at seizure onset and amount of failed AEDs
were strong predictors of adaptive functioning. Seizure onset is known
to have a bimodal distribution in ASD and current findings identified
distinct clinical patterns in early versus later onset seizures. Younger
onset was characterized by more frequent and atypical seizures, while
older onset was characterized by poorer social skills and greater prevalence of generalized tonic-clonic seizures.

B.C. KAVANAUGH, J. JONES, S. CORREIA, A. BLUM, W. LAFRANCE
& J. DAVIS. Differential Relationship between Depression and
White Matter Integrity in Adult versus Child Onset Temporal Lobe
Epilepsy.
Objective: White matter abnormalities occur in both temporal lobe
epilepsy (TLE) and depression, but there is limited research examining
the depression-white matter association in TLE. This study examined
the relationship between white matter integrity (WMI) and depression
and epilepsy-related variables in childhood vs. adult seizure onset.
Participants and Methods: Adults (N=20) with non-lesional TLE
with and without depression (TLE+D; n=11; TLE-D, n=9) underwent
diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). The sample was subdivided into childhood-onset seizures (COS; < 13 years; 4/11 with TLE+D) and adolescent/adult-onset seizures (AOS; 5/9 with TLE+D). Depression severity
was assessed with the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression. WMI was
estimated based on fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity
(MD) calculated in frontal-temporo-limbic (FTL) regions in the JHU
DTI atlas.
Results: Compared to COS, AOS showed lower FA in right uncinate
fasciculus and higher MD in left hippocampus. There were no significant group differences in seizure-related variables. Within COS, WMI
correlated significantly with depression severity (i.e., negatively with
FA; positively with MD) in the corpus callosum, fornix, right cingulum,
and bilateral superior longitudinal fasciculus. No significant WMI-depression correlations were found in FTL regions in AOS. COS had no

14
associations between WMI and seizure-related variables. In the AOS
group, the presence of seizures in past month was associated with lower
FA in the fornix.
Conclusions: WMI in FTL regions are similar in COS and AOS, but are
associated with depression in the COS group only. In the AOS group,
WMI is associated with the presence of seizures in the past month. The
results raise the possibility that COS impacts white matter development
thereby increasing vulnerability to depression; whereas AOS WMI is
alternatively more susceptible to current seizure severity. Epilepsy duration may also contribute to depression-WMI associations.

S. KIERSTEAD, W.S. MACALLISTER, M. VASSERMAN,
O. DEVINSKY & K. BLACKMON. Female Protective Effects for
Social Impairment in Autism and Epilepsy.
Objective: This research aims to test whether females with autism
spectrum disorders (ASD) and epilepsy are protected against social
impairment, relative to males. The female protective factor model of
ASD suggests that females require greater genetic mutational burden
than males to express the ASD phenotype. However, it remains unclear
whether female protective factors extend to all core symptoms of ASD.
We propose that females with ASD and epilepsy will show lower social
impairment, but not stereotyped behaviors, relative to males, supporting
a specific female protective effect against social impairment.
Participants and Methods: The sample included 89 participants, 69
males (age range = 4-33; mean=16.6, SD=6.4) and 20 females (age
range=3-35; mean=18.5, SD=7.7) with a DSM-IV diagnosis within the
autistic spectrum and a comorbid diagnosis of epilepsy. We included
individuals with this dual diagnosis so that sex differences in ASD
core symptoms could be investigated in males and females matched
for neurologic phenotype. The Social Communication Questionnaire
(SCQ) factor scores were used to approximate ASD severity for two
core symptoms of ASD: Social Impairment and Stereotyped Behavior.
We performed student t-tests to compare average factor scores between
males and females.
Results: As predicted, males scored higher than females on the Social
Impairment factor [t(87)=2.17; p=0.03] but there were no sex differences on the Stereotyped Behaviors factor [t(87)=1.18; p=0.24].
Conclusions: These results support protective factors for social ability
in females with ASD and epilepsy. Our finding of lower social impairment in females compared to males with ASD and comorbid epilepsy
contributes to the literature on sex differences in ASD symptom expression and suggests the need for sex-specific treatment considerations.

A. LEVAN, S.D. GALE, R.B. BURR & J.B. FULTON. The Relationship
between Executive Functioning and Social Skills in Children with
Epilepsy.
Objective: To identify the relationship between social skills and executive functioning measures in a pediatric epileptic population. It was
hypothesized that executive functioning would be positively correlated
with social skill scores and that executive functioning scores would predict social skill scores.
Participants and Methods: Participants were recruited from the epilepsy monitoring units at Phoenix Children’s Hospital in Phoenix, AZ
and Primary Children’s Medical Center in Salt Lake City, UT. There
was a total of 28 participants (50% female, M age at testing = 11.79,
SD = 3.12). Both the parents and children completed The Behavior
Rating Inventory of Executive Functioning (BRIEF), The Behavioral
Assessment System for Children (BASC-2), and The Social Skills Improvement System Rating Scales (SSIS).

Results: Correlational analysis revealed a strong, negative correlation
(r = -.55, p = .006) between the Behavioral Regulation Index (BRI) on
both the BRIEF parent and self-report and the Adaptive Skills Composite (ASC) on the BASC-2 parent report, and a moderate, negative
correlation (r = -.44, p = .026) between the BRI parent and self-report
and Social Skills Scale (SS) on the SSIS parent form. A multiple regression analysis produced R2 = .422, F (3, 36) = 8.76, p < .001, showing
children with higher scores (worse executive functioning) on the BRI
BRIEF parent form had lower ratings (worse social functioning) of SS
on the SSIS parent form.
Conclusions: Overall results showed executive functioning scores and
social skill scores were significantly correlated, and that executive functioning scores predicted social skill scores in pediatric epileptic patients.
Thus, in children with epilepsy, there was an association between executive and social functioning with worse executive function associated
with worse social skill scores.

Multidisciplinary Evaluation of “Subclinical Seizures” in Pediatric
Parietal Lobe Epilepsy: The Value of Neuropsychological
Evaluation.
Objective: Parietal lobe (PL) seizures are uncommon and not well-understood. Evaluation of such patients can be complicated by the lack
of an obvious or consistent clinical correlate for electrographic seizures,
despite that the PL houses eloquent cortex representing functions such
as language, praxis and spatial attention. Using a multidisciplinary approach, this case study illustrates unique clinical aspects of PL seizures
and highlights the contribution of formal neuropsychological testing
(NPT) for detecting ictal cognitive/behavioral changes that may not
otherwise be apparent.
Participants and Methods: The case involves a previously healthy
11-year-old who presented to UCSF with a six-month history of presumed focal epilepsy.
Results: Initial MRI had been normal. Despite medication she continued
to have occasional seizures with varying semiologies. Video electroencephalogram [vEEG] at UCSF suggested numerous, daily subclinical
seizures (i.e., apparent only on EEG) that had not been recognized.
Beyond epilepsy protocol MRI, which revealed a left parietal lesion,
UCSF workup also involved serial NPT. The first NPT uncovered rare,
transient hemi-neglect, dyslexia and dysgraphia, amidst baseline but
nonspecific language and verbal memory deficits. After clinical seizures
had been controlled with medication adjustments, repeat NPT conducted with concomitant vEEG did not reveal any transient impairments
of the type seen previously. However, persistent “subclinical” seizures
were detected and found to be coincident with more subtle abnormalities, which were not reported by the patient and unlikely to have been
detected with clinical observation alone.
Conclusions: This case provides an illustration of the subtle but detectable (with formal NPT) clinical presentation of focal PL seizures. It
also raises an issue for neuropsychologists evaluating refractory epilepsy
patients; specifically, variability in performance during NPT that is
thought to be ‘noise’ may actually be related to covert seizure activity.

Volume Predicts Working Memory Performance in Children with
BECTS.
Objective: Benign Epilepsy with Centro-Temporal Spikes (BECTS) is
a childhood epileptic disorder often accompanied with cognitive difficulties involving basal ganglia functions (Lewis et al 2004). Our main

Forty Fourth Annual INS Meeting Abstracts
aim was to study the association between putamen volumes and working
memory (WM) performance in BECTS. Brain structure segmentation
accuracy is mandatory, but challenging. The second aim of this study
was to determine which brain structure segmentation technique is most
sensitive.
Participants and Methods: 16 BECTS children and 20 controls. Using a Philips Achieva X 3.0 Tesla MRI system T1-weighted structural
scan. Neuropsychological evaluation including IQ, language and verbal
memory testing were performed. Left putamen volumes were obtained
with: 1) automatic FSL/FIRST tool based on the CMA protocol (see
http://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/FIRST), 2) manual corrections to
FSL segmentations based on the CMA protocol 3) automatic segmentation with the a Model-based Brain Segmentation (MBS) approach
developed by Philips Research. Putamen volumes/total brain sizes ratios
were calculated. T-tests were used to verify group differences, and partial correlations to assess neuropsychological performances (IQ indexes,
denomination, verbal memory) and volume associations in both groups
separately.
Results: Left putamen is significantly smaller in BECTS vs controls
(p<0.05). Results show a significant correlation between left putamen
volumes obtained from both the manually corrected segmentations and
MBS and the WM index in both groups (p<0.05). While the patient
group showed a positive correlation, the control group showed a negative correlation.
Conclusions: Our results demonstrate an association between left
putamen volumes and verbal WM performance. While abnormally
reduced putamen volumes in BECTS predict more deficits, enlarged
putamen volumes in controls indicate more deficits. The manual and
the MBS approach were sensitive to volume modifications.

W.S. MACALLISTER, H. MURPHY, M. MAIMAN, S. POWELL &
M. VASSERMAN. The Utility of the WISC-V in Child and Adolescent
Epilepsy.
Objective: Earlier work has demonstrated the utility of prior versions
of the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (WISC) in children and
teens with epilepsy. However, the WISC-V has limited available data.
The present investigation assesses the sensitivity of the WISC-V to cognitive impairment in this group.
Participants and Methods: 20 consecutively seen children and adolescents with epilepsy were administered the WISC-V as part of a
neuropsychological evaluation. Means and standard deviations were
calculated for composite and subtest scores. Correlational analyses assessed the relations between WISC-V composites and epilepsy severity
variables.
Results: Participants ranged in age from 6–14 years (Mean=9.70) and
had an average age of epilepsy onset of 3.53 years (range= birth–8
years). The WISC-V Full Scale IQ of the group was 88.45 (SD=17.74,
range=62-118). On average, the Working Memory Index was the weakest composite (WMI; Mean=87.85, SD=17.33), followed by the Processing Speed Index (PSI; Mean=88.05, SD=19.74) and Visual Spatial
Index (VSI) (Mean=89.20, SD=16.21). The Verbal Comprehension Index (VCI; Mean=96.10, SD=18.94) and Fluid Reasoning Index (FRI;
Mean=90.35, SD=15.96) were the strongest indices. On average, Digit
Span (Mean=7.45, SD=2.91) and Block Design (Mean=7.45, SD=2.54)
were the weakest subtests for the group, whereas Vocabulary was the
strongest (Mean=9.45, SD=3.94). Using a criterion of a scaled score 5 or
lower as a threshold for impairment, Digit Span was the most frequently
impaired subtest (35% of sample), followed by Picture Span (30%).
Figure Weights was least frequently impaired (10%). Modest relations
(i.e., r>.30) between number of epilepsy medications and FSIQ, VCI,
VSI, FRI, and WMI were seen. Age of epilepsy onset and seizure frequency were not strongly related to WISC-V composites.

15
Conclusions: The WISC-V appears sensitive to cognitive status in children and teens with epilepsy, but has different psychometric properties
from prior versions of the WISC.

J.R. BINDER, L. GLASS UMFLEET & S.J. SWANSON. The
Relationship between Perceived and Objective Cognitive Change
Following Temporal Lobectomy.
Objective: Previous research suggests that for individuals with epilepsy,
mood is a greater predictor of perceived cognitive functioning (PCF)
than is actual cognitive performance. Less research has investigated
the relationship between objective cognitive change and change in PCF
after patients undergo an anterior temporal lobectomy (ATL). Results
have been mixed and studies often fail to control for factors such as
mood. The aim of the current investigation was to determine if change
in objective cognitive functioning after surgery is predictive of patients’
PCF, after controlling for mood and surgical outcome.
Participants and Methods: As part of a routine pre- and post-surgical
work-up, 107 (67 with right ATL, 40 with left ATL) patients completed
neuropsychological testing. Correlational and regression analyses were
conducted to investigate the relationship between objective memory
change, as measured by the WMS Logical Memory II delayed recall,
and change in PCF on the Quality of Life in Epilepsy-31 Cognitive
Functioning subscale.
Results: There was a significant improvement in PCF in both left and
right ATL groups following ATL (p’s<.05). Left ATL patients exhibited
a decline while right ATL patients showed a significant improvement
in Logical Memory following surgery (p=.03). Furthermore, in left
ATL patients, objective memory change was not significantly related
to change in PCF. However, for right ATL patients, objective memory
change was marginally significantly related to change in PCF, even after
accounting for mood and seizure outcome (p=.048).
Conclusions: Our results replicated past findings that for left ATL
patients, objective memory change is not a good predictor of change in
PCF. However, for right ATL patients objective memory improvement
was predictive of change in PCF, even after accounting for mood and
seizure outcome. Therefore, the story in the current literature that objective memory performance shows little relationship with a patient’s
perceived cognitive functioning may be overly simplistic.

Inter-rater Reliability of the Parent versus Teacher Forms of the
Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function in Children and
Adolescence with Epilepsy.
Objective: Children and adolescence with epilepsy frequently exhibit
executive dysfunction. Prior work has demonstrated that the parent-report form of the Behavioral Rating Inventory of Executive Function
(BRIEF) is useful in assessing executive dysfunction in children and
adolescence with epilepsy. However, the teacher-report form remains
less examined in this population, and the inter-rater reliability (IRR)
between parent and teacher-report forms has not been established.
Participants and Methods: The parents and teachers of 64 clinically
referred children and adolescence with epilepsy (Age: M=9.8 SD=2.42,
Range=7-17; IQ: M=97.8, SD=12.88, Range= 69=130) completed the
BRIEF as part of a comprehensive neuropsychological assessment. Intra-class correlation coefficients (ICC) were utilized to analyze the IRR
of the parent and teacher forms of the BRIEF.
Results: With the exception of the organization of materials subscale
of the BRIEF, all other scales demonstrated moderate to strong IRR,
with ICC’s ranging from .334 to .629. Even more impressive, the IRR

16
for the BRIEF as a whole was moderate (Global Executive Composite
ICC = .524).
Conclusions: This study demonstrates that the parent and teacher
forms for the BRIEF show moderate to strong IRR in children and
adolescence with epilepsy.

A. MARTIN, L. SEPETA, J. FACELLA-ERVOLINI, W. GAILLARD
& M. BERL. The Influence of Executive Function on Memory and
Learning in Pediatric Focal Epilepsy.
Objective: The pattern of memory deficits in pediatric epilepsy is not
clear. Discrepant research findings may be related to methodological
differences including memory test selection. Paired association (PA)
learning engages memory systems maximally and is sensitive to mesial
temporal lobe (MTL) damage. Thus, we compared PA to single-word
list learning in relation to executive function (EF) to clarify memory
profiles in pediatric focal epilepsy.
Participants and Methods: 175 children (96 Males;Age=10.5±3.2)
with focal epilepsy had neuropsychological evaluation including Behavior Rating Index of Executive Functioning (BRIEF), Digit Span
Backwards (DSB), Tower of London-DX (TOL-DX), Childhood Memory Scale (CMS), and California Verbal Learning Test for Children
(CVLT-C). Normative z-scores were used with inversion of BRIEF
scores such that lower scores reflect worse performance. We used repeated measures ANCOVA with memory test [CMS Word Pairs Long
Delay (CMS-WPLD), CVLT-C Long Delay Free Recall (CVLT-LDFR)]
as a within-group factor; BRIEF metacognitive index (BRIEF-MCI) was
used as a covariate to examine EF’s impact on memory. Linear regression analyses were conducted with EF predictors (DSB, TOL-DX Total
Moves (TOL-DX TM), BRIEF-MCI) and CMS-WPLD and CVLT-LDFR
as dependent variables.
Results: We found a trend for a main effect of memory test
(F(1,26)=3.67,p=.067), with better performance on CVLT-LDFR than
CMS-WPLD. There was no main effect of BRIEF-MCI across memory
tests nor an interaction between memory test and BRIEF-MCI. Linear
regression analyses showed that BRIEF-MCI (R2=.068,p<.01) and DSB
(R2=.270,p<.01) predicted performance on CVLT-LDFR. No EF variables predicted CMS-WPLD.
Conclusions: Gold standard single-word list learning tasks, such as
CVLT-C, are aided by EF strategies more than PA learning, consistent with research showing the latter is particularly sensitive to MTL
functioning. Knowledge of underlying mechanisms of poor memory
performance in focal epilepsy has implications for potential cognitive
intervention.

A.A. MULLANE, D. FLODEN, R. NAUGLE, L. FERGUSON &
R.M. BUSCH. Patients with Memory Retrieval Difficulties are at
Risk for Objective and Subjective Memory Declines Following Left
Temporal Resection for Epilepsy.
Objective: Preoperative verbal memory performance is a strong predictor of postoperative memory outcome following left temporal lobe
resection (TLR) for pharmacoresistant epilepsy. Most prediction models
include delayed free recall of verbal information with little consideration
of recognition performance. This study examined objective and subjective postoperative memory outcome in patients with preoperative memory retrieval difficulties (impaired free recall with intact recognition).
Participants and Methods: Fifty-five patients (mean age 41 years;
66% female) completed objective (RAVLT) and subjective (MAC-S)
memory measures prior to and following left TLR including mesial
structures. Patients were categorized into 4 groups based on impaired/
intact preoperative performance on Trial 7 and benefit/no benefit from

recognition cues. Changes scores on the RAVLT (Trial 7 and Recognition) and MAC-S (Ability and Frequency scales) were categorized
as decline or no decline using RCIs or a 1 SD cutoff. ANOVAs and
chi-squares examined demographic differences between groups and
differences in memory outcomes.
Results: Few patients (10%) with preoperative retrieval difficulties
showed postoperative declines in free recall; however, a substantial
number (40%) demonstrated meaningful declines in recognition memory after left TLR. Of those with objective recognition declines, 38%
endorsed subjective declines in memory ability and increased frequency
of memory failures. Free recall declines among the other three patient
groups were consistent with existing literature (40-47% decline in those
with intact recall and 0% decline in those with impaired recall).
Conclusions: Results suggest that special consideration should be given
to patients whose preoperative verbal memory performance suggests
retrieval difficulties rather than a primary encoding deficit. These individuals appear to be at increased risk for memory decline following
surgery, which may impact quality of life in a substantial proportion
of patients.

Preliminary Validation of a Novel Method of Presurgical fMRI
Language Localization through Functional Connectivity Analysis.
Objective: Neurosurgery is potentially curative in chronic epilepsy but
can only be offered to patients if the surgical risk to language is known.
Clinical functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is a potentially
ideal, noninvasive method for localizing language cortex yet remains
to be validated for this purpose. Here connectivity analyses provide
preliminary validation of a novel presurgical fMRI method relying on
an expanded neurocognitive model of language.
Participants and Methods: fMRI data were collected from sixteen
temporal lobe patients (12 left) being evaluated for epilepsy surgery
at UCLA (mean age 38.9 [sd 11.4]; 6 female; per Wada 14 left language dominant, 1 right, 1 mixed). Language maps were generated
using a novel clinician-based approach to analysis involving dynamic
thresholding and conjunction of three language tasks to identify Broca’s area, Wernicke’s Area, Angular gyrus, Basal Temporal Language
Area, Exner’s Area, and Supplementary Speech Cortex. With activations
defined as network nodes, mean network connectivity was compared
via permutation tests with alternate (i) fully random and (ii) proximal
random networks. Mean network connectivity was determined in independently-acquired motor fMRI datasets (9 foot, 16 hand, 14 tongue).
Results: 79% of clinician-derived language maps exhibited mean
connectivity greater than fully random networks (p<0.05). 71% of
clinician-derived language maps exhibited mean connectivity greater
than proximal random networks (p<0.05). Most networks not passing
the permutation tests (i.e., 75%-89%) contained a majority of nodes
(>50%) that were weakly correlated (r<0.1) with the network, indicating that most of these are not cohesive networks.
Conclusions: This study provides preliminary validity for a novel, clinician-based approach to presurgical language localization. This complements our recent work showing this method is reliable, and supports
a proposed study comparing fMRI language maps using this technique
with the results of direct stimulation mapping.

T.A. CALLER, F.P. ALEXANDRE & B.C. JOBST. RBANS Embedded
Effort Measures in Adults with Focal Epilepsy.
Objective: The Effort Index (EI) and Effort Scale (ES) have been put
forth as performance validity measures (PVM) for the Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS). There
is little data, however, on the prevalence of insufficient effort based on
these indices in patients with epilepsy.
Participants and Methods: Participants were 55 adults with focal
epilepsy (mean age=46.3, SD=10.7; 67.3% women), recruited for a
research study through our comprehensive epilepsy evaluation program,
who completed the RBANS. The EI is calculated by summing weighted
scores for the Digit Span and List Recognition subtests, with cutoff
scores of >3 and >0 recommended (Silverberg, Wertheimer, & Fichtenberg, 2007). The ES emphasizes the discrepancy between free recall
and recognition memory [List Recognition – (List Recall + Story Recall
+ Figure Recall) + Digit Span], with a score < 12 considered invalid
(Novitski, Steele, Karantzoulis, & Randolph, 2012). We also examined
the relationship between the effort indices and score on a depression
scale (PHQ-9).
Results: For the EI, 40% of patients were invalid based on a cutoff of
>0 but only 1.8% using the cutoff of >3. For the ES, 72.7% of scores
were in the invalid range. A total of 25% were considered invalid based
on a Digit Span score of < 9, and 34.5% based on a Recognition score of
< 19. Neither the EI nor ES was correlated with self-rated depression.
Conclusions: The prevalence rate of failures on either in EI (using a
cutoff score of 0) or ES was far higher than expected based on prior studies of healthy and clinical samples, as well as studies using other PVMs
in patients with epilepsy. Caution should therefore be exerted before
considering RBANS performance to be invalid based on these cutoffs
alone in patients with epilepsy. Further research including well-validated PVMs will be important to establish the sensitivity and specificity
of cutoffs when using these RBANS indices in this patient population.

The Relations Between Performance-Based Measures of Executive
Dysfunction and Teacher-Reported Executive Dysfunction in
Children with Epilepsy.
Objective: Executive dysfunction is commonly seen in childhood onset
epilepsy. Prior research has shown that that children and adolescents
with epilepsy have deficits on performance-based executive function
measures, as well as ‘real world’ executive deficits as reported by parents. Unfortunately, the relations between performance based measures
(such as the Tower of London-DX [TOL]) and parent report on the
Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Functions (BRIEF) are weak.
The present investigation assesses whether stronger relations are seen
between the TOL and teacher reported executive dysfunction, given that
teachers are able to observe children in a more cognitively demanding
environment.
Participants and Methods: 64 consecutively evaluated children (Age:
M=9.8, Range=7-17) with epilepsy were administered the TOL-DX
as part of a comprehensive neuropsychological battery. Their teachers
completed the BRIEF. Epilepsy severity variables (e.g., age of onset,
number of anti-epilepsy medications, seizure frequency) and IQ were
also recorded. Correlational analyses assessed the relations between
TOL-DX scores, BRIEF indices, and epilepsy severity variables.
Results: Of the BRIEF subscales, working memory was the most frequently teacher-reported deficit (42%), followed by deficits in task
initiation (28%), and planning/organization (25%). However, there
were no significant correlations between teacher reported executive dysfunction on the BRIEF and TOL variables or epilepsy severity variables.
Conversely, there were modest correlations between FSIQ and working
memory (r=-.252) as well as task-initiation (r=-.305) on the BRIEF.

17
Conclusions: Like the parent-report version of the BRIEF, the teacher-report form shows sensitivity to executive dysfunction in children
and adolescents with epilepsy. However, it also fails to correlate with
performance-based executive measures, despite some relations with intellectual functioning.

G.R. REY, C. VEGA, A.M. KANNER & G.J. REY. Verbal Memory
Assessment of Spanish-Speaking Patients with Temporal Lobe
Epilepsy.
Objective: Developing appropriate instruments for accurate detection
and characterization of memory problems in Spanish-speakers residing
in the US continues to be a pressing issue. In patients with temporal
lobe epilepsy (TLE), assessing memory is helpful when determining
treatment options such as surgery, as a risk of verbal memory decline
has been identified following temporal resection in 44% (left) and 20%
(right) of adults (Sherman et al., 2011). The current study was designed
to determine the clinical utility of the Verbal Learning subtest of the
Miami Attention and Memory Instrument (MAMI-VLS) in identifying
differences in memory function in left and right TLE Spanish-speaking
patients being considered for surgery.
Participants and Methods: Patients were identified through archival
record review. The sample consisted of 26 patients (50 % females; 12
left and 14 right). Mean age at the time of the evaluation was 47.5
(SD=11.5). Years of education was 12.3 (SD = 3.1). All patients completed a comprehensive neuropsychological battery that included the
MAMI-VLS, a verbal list learning test consisting of 14 words presented
over 5 trials, an interference list, and immediate, delayed and recognition trials. Independent sample t-tests were conducted for analysis.
Results: No group differences were found on IQ, age, or education.
Analysis showed worse performance of the left TLE group on delayed
recall of the word list (p< .05). Although no statistical differences were
evident on total learning following five trials, group means show better
performance for the right TLE group.
Conclusions: Preliminary analysis indicate that the MAMI-VLS is sensitive to identifying dominant TLE memory problems in Spanish-speaking adults. Utilizing this tool as part of a presurgical battery can assist in
decisions regarding risk of memory morbidity from the procedure. Our
data is consistent with previous investigations that document a rapid
loss of verbal memory traces over short delay periods in patients with
left compared to right TLE.

Amplitude of Low-frequency Fluctuation on Resting State fMRI
Differentiates Temporal Lobe Epilepsy with and without Mesial
Temporal Sclerosis.
Objective: Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) with and without mesial temporal lobe sclerosis (MTS) are distinct neurological syndromes with
unique and common features. Differentiating TLE with MTS from TLE
without MTS is important for prognosis following resective epilepsy
surgery. This study identifies novel functional MRI features that distinguish these two groups.
Participants and Methods: Thirty patients with TLE and thirty sex/
age-matched controls consented to a research imaging protocol. TLE
was verified in all patients with intracranial EEG. MTS status was
confirmed by histological evaluation of surgical tissue (MTS-13; nonMTS=17). Fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (fALFF)
of the BOLD resting-state fMRI signal was averaged at six different
regions of interest in each hemisphere (hippocampus, amygdala, frontal,
parietal, occipital, and temporal lobe). Regions of interest were labeled

18
ipsilateral or contralateral according to seizure lateralization. A paired
t test was used to test for fALFF differences between patient groups
and controls.
Results: The MTS group had lower fALFF in the ipsilateral hippocampus and amygdala compared to controls (t(12)=-2.38, p< 0.05, t(12)=3.26, p< 0.01, respectively), as well as reduced fALFF in the ipsilateral
and contralateral frontal lobes (t(12)=-2.54, p< 0.05, t(12)=-2.37, p<
0.05, respectively). In the non-MTS group, fALFF in the hippocampi
or amygdalae were normal, but average fALFF values were reduced in
ipsilateral and contralateral frontal lobes (t(16)=-3.5, p< 0.01, t(16)=3.57, p< 0.01, respectively).
Conclusions: We found mesial temporal fALFF abnormalities in TLE
patients with MTS, but not in those without MTS. These findings provide validation for fALFF as a marker of focal reduction in functional
integrity. Reduced frontal lobe fALFF in both groups suggests that
fALFF is also sensitive to widespread functional abnormalities, possibly accounting for common cognitive comorbidities (e.g., executive
dysfunction) observed in TLE with and without MTS.

F.P. ALEXANDRE & B.C. JOBST. Self-Rated Executive Dysfunction
in Adults with Focal Epilepsy.
Objective: Adults with epilepsy commonly show deficits on performance-based tests of executive functions. The extent to which such
patients report experiencing executive dysfunction in their everyday
lives, however, is unknown. The present study therefore evaluated the
prevalence of self-rated executive dysfunction in a sample of adults
with focal epilepsy.
Participants and Methods: Participants included 55 adults diagnosed
as having focal epilepsy (mean age = 46.3, SD = 10.7; 67.3% women),
recruited through our comprehensive epilepsy evaluation program, who
completed the completed the Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive
Function-Adult (BRIEF-A). The BRIEF-A assesses nine aspects of executive functions as experienced in everyday life over the past month.
Participants also completed a measure of depression (PHQ-9).
Results: Overall, the patient sample obtained mean BRIEF-A scores in
the clinical range (T≥65) only for the Working Memory scale, Metacognition Index and Global Executive Composite (GEC), with subtler
elevations (T=60-64) seen for several other scales and the Behavior
Regulation index. Clinical elevations were most common for Working
Memory (87.3%), Shift (49.1%), Emotional Control, Task Monitoring and Planning/Organize (each 47.3%). The overall score for the
BRIEF-A, the GEC, was elevated in 54.5% of participants. Greater
depression was associated with poorer subjective executive function for
all scales (correlations ranging from .34 to .64).
Conclusions: These findings indicate that a sizable subset of patients
with focal epilepsy endorses executive dysfunction in their everyday
lives, which is related in part to symptoms of depression. Further research examining factors that contribute to subjective executive dysfunction in patients with epilepsy will be informative.

M.R. SCHOENBERG. Seizure Remission Status Following Surgery
for Localization-related Epilepsy Associated with Differences in
Postoperative WAIS-IV Performances.
Objective: Epilepsy surgery has focused on advancing surgical techniques to improve seizure remission outcomes, and more data are needed
regarding how seizure remission outcomes relate to other postoperative

variables, such as intellectual functioning. To these ends, we assessed
whether localization-related epilepsy patients who underwent surgical resections for treatment of medication refractory seizures different in postoperative Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale, Fourth Edition
(WAIS-IV) index scores as a function of postoperative Engel class
outcome.
Participants and Methods: Participants included 71 postoperative
epilepsy patients, of which 51 achieved complete seizure remission (Engel class I), and 20 achieved suboptimal seizure remission (Engel class
II-IV). Groups were similar in terms of age, years of education, and
length of epilepsy (all p> .24). Potential group differences by seizure
remission status (Engel class I vs II-IV) were evaluated for each index
of the WAIS-IV.
Results: Participants who achieved complete seizure remission had
significantly better performances on Full Scale IQ (p = .01, d = .72),
Perceptual Reasoning Index (p = .007, d = .82), Working Memory Index
(p = .004, d = .83), and Processing Speed Index (p = .006, d = .78).
No group differences were observed on Verbal Comprehension Index
(p = .59).
Conclusions: Results suggest that among this postoperative epilepsy
sample, achievement of complete seizure remission was associated with
better postoperative intellectual functioning.

R.S. RUM, K. OSBORN, R. SEVER, H. WASEEM, R. TAVOLONI
& M.R. SCHOENBERG. Impact of seizure remission status
and neuropsychological functioning on quality of life among
postoperative epilepsy patients.
Objective: While there is a large focus on the impact of seizures on quality of life (QOL), the impact of objectively assessed cognitive functioning
on QOL has not been thoroughly addressed, and more information is
needed to better understand each of these variables in the context of surgery for treatment of medication refractory localization-related epilepsy.
Participants and Methods: Participants included postoperative medication refractory localization-related epilepsy patients (n=60) who
underwent pre- and postoperative neuropsychological evaluations including self-ratings of health-related quality of life using the Quality of
Life in Epilepsy (QOLIE-31). ANOVAs evaluated differences in QOLIE-31 total and cognitive functioning index scores by seizure remission
status (Engel class I versus II-IV). Pearson’s r correlations were used to
examine potential associations between various postoperative neuropsychological measures and the two aforementioned QOLIE-31 variables.
Results: Patients with complete seizure remission (Engel class I) had
significantly higher total scores on the QOLIE-31 (p = .003), but no
group differences were observed for the cognitive functioning index.
QOLIE-31 total scores were significantly correlated with better performances on WAIS-IV FSIQ (r = .27, p = .04) and PSI (r = .31, p = .02),
and on animal fluency (r = .31, p = 02). QOLIE-31 cognitive functioning
index scores were significantly correlated with better performances on
Green’s Word Memory Test Free Recall (r = .39, p = .003), and the
WAIS-IV FSIQ (r = .29 p = .03) and PSI (r = .35, p = .007).
Conclusions: Results confirm earlier studies indicating seizure remission is associated with improved quality of life and also highlight the
association between objective cognitive functioning and quality of life
among postoperative epilepsy patients.

M.I. SALEH, M. MAIMAN & W.S. MACALLISTER. The Utility
of Neuropsychology in Predicting Functional Reorganization in
Presurgical Pediatric Epilepsy Cases.
Objective: Epilepsy patients with dominant hemisphere seizures have
higher rates of functional reorganization of language skills to the

Forty Fourth Annual INS Meeting Abstracts
contralateral hemisphere. This case series investigates the utility of
neuropsychological evaluation data to predict functional reorganization in pediatric epilepsy. The authors propose that a pattern of verbal
strengths and visuospatial weaknesses in children and adolescents with
left-hemisphere activity is suggestive of functional reorganization as
confirmed by intracranial amobarbital procedure (i.e., Wada test).
Participants and Methods: A systematic, retrospective review of pediatric records from 2009 through January 2015 at the NYU Epilepsy
Center identified 33 pediatric cases that received Wada examination as
part of presurgical work-up. Eight were excluded due to right-hemisphere seizure foci; five, due to incomplete neuropsychological records;
and seven, due to intellectual disability. The remaining 13 participants
had clearly lateralized left-hemisphere seizure foci on electroencephalograph (EEG), a comprehensive neuropsychological evaluation, and
an Wada testing.
Expert review of blinded neuropsychological profiles determined evidence of functional reorganization, no evidence of reorganization, or
indeterminate data, with the pattern of language/verbal memory versus
visual-spatial skills/visual memory being the major factors considered.
Results: Functional reorganization versus no reorganization as determined by Wada exam was correctly predicted reorganization in 64%
of cases.
Conclusions: The observed pattern may suggest classic “crowding”
effects, in which language reorganization to the right hemisphere causes
poorer development of visuospatial skills while preserving language and
verbal memory. The presented pattern may have clinical utility in identifying children with functional reorganization and cognitive risk factors
following surgical resection. Future studies should use a larger sample
size to investigate the accuracy of this method.

W.A. SCHRAEGLE, N. NUSSBAUM, A.K. STEFANATOS &
J. TITUS. Pattern of Memory Performance in Children with
Frontal or Temporal Lobe Epilepsy.
Objective: To examine the differences between frontal and temporal
memory systems in pediatric epilepsy, we tested the relationship between
CVLT-C recall profiles and interference variables [proactive (PI) and
retroactive (RI)] by seizure classification [temporal (TLE) vs. frontal
(FLE)]. Hypotheses: greater RI and lower PI in the TLE group and
vice versa for the FLE group; and a weaker verbal memory profile in
the TLE group.
Participants and Methods: Forty-one epileptic children treated at
DCMC’s completed the CVLT-C. Epileptic focus and lateralization were
classified for each child based on electroencephalogram (EEG), semiology, and neurologist diagnosis; resulting in TLE (n=21, 14 males) and
FLE (n=20, 16 males) groups. Cases with multiple epilepsy types were
not included. No between group differences seen across several clinical
and neuropsychological variables. Interference types were operationalized based on Donders (2006). CVLT recall variables correlating with
classification (p<.05) were included in the primary analysis.
Results: Our findings revealed significant differences in RI [F(2,27),
p=.01] implicating the TLE group (TLE, 91.4; FLE, 107.12); non-significant findings for PI [F(2,27), p=.37] with mean differences trending
towards worse PI in the FLE (TLE, 98.9; FLE, 96.3). Additionally, the
FLE group showed significant differences in the pattern of RI and PI
[t(19), p=.03)] emphasizing a stronger PI effect (PI, 96.3; RI, 107.1).
Despite non significant findings between RI and PI within the TLE
group [t(20), p=.15)]; mean differences trended towards worse RI (RI,
91.4; PI, 98.9). Finally, Immediate Recall [F(1,40), p=.05)] and Immediate Cued Recall [F(1,40), p=.03)] were worse in the TLE group.
Conclusions: Results highlight the interplay between frontal and temporal memory systems and how seizure foci differentially impact these
processes in meaningful ways.

B. SHIELDS & S. HUNTER. The Relation between Executive
Functioning and Psychological Disturbance in Youth with
Pediatric Generalized Epilepsy.
Objective: Pediatric epilepsy puts children at risk for a number of
neurocognitive and behavioral difficulties compared to children without
epilepsy. Previous work has shown deficits in executive functions (EF)
in up to 30-40% of children with epilepsy (Dunn & Kronenberger,
2005). Additionally, children with epilepsy have higher rates of both
internalizing (Ettinger et al., 1998) and externalizing problems (Plioplys
et al., 2007). However, few studies have examined the link between
EF and psychological adjustment in children with epilepsy. To address
this gap, we examined the relation between EF and internalizing and
externalizing problems in a sample of children with generalized epilepsy.
Participants and Methods: Participants were maternal caregivers of
46 children (64% male; M=10.63+4.73, 64% Caucasian) with a primary
diagnosis of pediatric generalized epilepsy presenting at the University
of Chicago for neuropsychological evaluation. Caregivers reported on
(a) youth global EF using the Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive
Functioning (Gioia et al., 2000), and (b) youth internalizing and externalizing problems using the Behavior Assessment System for Children
(Reynolds & Kamphaus, 2004). Linear regression analyses were used
to examine the relation between EF and psychological disturbances.
Results: Youth EF significantly predicted internalizing problems
(B=.45, t[43]=2.58, p=.01), and explained a significant proportion
of variance in externalizing scores (R2=.13, F(1, 45)=12.31, p=.001).
EF also significantly predicted youth externalizing problems (B=.59,
t[44]=3.65, p=.001), and explained a significant proportion of variance
in externalizing scores (R2=.23, F(1, 45)=12.31, p=.001).
Conclusions: Poor EF may play an important role in influencing psychological functioning in youth with generalized epilepsy. Prevention
and intervention efforts that focus on both psychosocial functioning
as well as improving EF may benefit youth with generalized epilepsy.

(Translated) in Thai Patient with Temporal Lobe Epilepsy due to
Hippocampal Sclerosis.
Objective: To use the memory subtest scores (Wechsler Memory ScaleThird Edition: WMS-III) in lateralizing epileptogenic temporal lobe in
patient with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE)
Participants and Methods: We retrospective adult patients with unilateral TLE defined by unilateral MRI lesions and unilateral EEG seizure
onset who underwent a resection of the temporal lobe at Prasat Neurological Institute between 1th January 2011-31th January 2014. All
patients recieved presurgical assessments including MRI, interictal and
ictal video EEG monitoring and memory testing by Wechsler Memory
Scale-Third Edition. Demographic data and memory scores were compared, using simple t-test, Chi-square test, and Mann-Whitney U-test
accordingly.
Results: 44 consecutive patients were included. 24 patients with L-TLE
and 20 patients with R-TLE. There are no statistically significant difference in age, handedness, age of onset, and duration of epilepsy between
two groups.The patients with R-TLE have a slightly higher scores in
all subtests. We only found a statistical difference in auditory delayed
score between L-TLE and R-TLE (p=0.03). We compared between
auditory delayed score and visual delayed score in both groups, the
auditory delayed score and visual delayed score in L-TLE is not much
difference between two subtests score, while it is look like that majority
of patients of R-TLE have worsen in visual delayed score.

A.K. STEFANATOS & N. NUSSBAUM. Neurocognitive Sequelae
of Frontal and Temporal Lobe Epilepsy in Children: Support for
Network Impairment.
Objective: There is strong evidence that epilepsy results in significant
neurodevelopmental sequelae that is greater with earlier onset of seizure activity. While this has been separately observed in children with
frontal and temporal lobe epilepsy, few studies have directly compared
these epilepsy syndromes utilizing broad assessments spanning multiple
domains. We therefore evaluated the degree and selectivity of patterns
of cognitive dysfunction in children with frontal (FLE) and temporal
(TLE) lobe epilepsy.
Participants and Methods: Participants included 51 children between
the ages of 6 and 16 years with intractable epilepsy who were seen for a
neuropsychological evaluation through a comprehensive epilepsy program. Participants were administered measures of memory, executive,
motor and intellectual functioning.
Results: Contrary to the selective patterns of deficits typically described
in adults, both the FLE and TLE groups demonstrated significant impairments relative to normative values on each of the neuropsychological domains assessed. Moreover, no significant differences were found
between the two patient groups on any of the measures.
Conclusions: The results from the current study suggest that individuals with childhood-onset epilepsy exhibit broad patterns of cognitive
compromise, regardless of seizure localization. These findings support
emerging models which conceptualize seizures as impacting the development of distributed brain networks, such that seizures affecting
any part of a functional neural network can result in a similar pattern
of cognitive impairment. The findings provide important insights into
the organization of cognitive and behavioral functions following early
neurological insults associated with epilepsy and challenge long-held
assumptions about the neuropsychology of “localization-related” or
“focal” epilepsies.

M. BERL, V. TERWILLIGER, M. SMITH & C. BULTEAU. Survey
Results of Neuropsychological Evaluation in Presurgical Pediatric
Epilepsy.
Objective: Understanding the different outcomes of pediatric epilepsy
surgery requires large datasets because of the numerous factors that
contribute to such differences. A barrier has traditionally been the lack
of consistency in measures used. An ILAE survey of neuropsychologists
(NPs) was conducted to determine where there is commonality and
divergence in current practices.
Participants and Methods: An online survey using REDCap was distributed via individual emails of pediatric NPs who conduct presurgical
epilepsy evaluations, or other members of a surgical team if the neuropsychologist was unknown, and by posting on the International Mail List
for Pediatric Neuropsychology. The survey was open from June 2014
to July 2015. Question format differed depending on the information
being acquired. Descriptive analyses were reported.
Results: 74 responses from 16 countries were received. The majority of
responses were from the USA (61%). NPs had an average of 14.7 years
of experience. 90% conduct presurgical evaluations for most of their surgical patients while 56.9% conduct postsurgical evaluations. There was
high consistency (>90%) in the domains assessed but consistency of specific measures and from non-USA responders were lower. WISC-IV had
the highest usage for USA (97%) and other countries (71%). For USA
NPs, consistency of use was high for the BNT(80%), NEPSYII(82%),
DKEFS(84%), VMI(93%), Rey-O(80%), Grooved Pegboard(93%),

Conners CPT(75%), BRIEF(91%), WCST(80%), WRAML2(71%),
CVLT-C(80%), BASC (77%); ABAS-II (73%).
Conclusions: For USA sites, there is at least one measure used by more
than 75% of practitioners within each domain. This result is a basis for
a recommendation of measures to use based on the consensus of NPs
conducting presurgical evaluations and could serve as a starting point
from which to develop multi-site collaboration through a common data
repository. Points for practice development include lower frequency of
post-surgical evaluation and low consistency of use of similar measures
in non-USA countries.

M. BERL, X. YOU, L. SEPETA & J. FACELLA-ERVOLINI. Profiles
of Memory and Learning of the CVLT-C using Graph Theory.
Objective: The California Verbal Learning Test for Children (CVLT-C)
is a powerful measure of learning and memory because it not only
quantifies what, but also how, a child remembers. We used novel data-driven statistical methods that apply graph theory with the aim of
categorizing different profiles within a large population of children with
and without epilepsy.
Participants and Methods: 260 children ranging from 5-16 years old
(137 males) were included if they had completed a CVLT-C and IQ.
127 children were typically developing (TD) and 133 had focal epilepsy
(EPI). 21 normative z-scores were used from the CVLT-C to create
correlation matrices (260x260) between subjects, which provided distance information between any given subject pair. Community detection
was applied to this matrice using a Walk Trap algorithm in the igraph
package in R. Community structure reveals subgroups of participants
that share similar behavioral phenotypic features.
Results: We found three communities that significantly differed in terms
of their memory performance and strategies used. Subgroup1 performed
best (mean z on recall trials > 0), used a serial strategy, and had good
recall consistency. Subgroup2 performed poorly (z < -1) recalled items
from the end of the list, and had more intrusion errors. Subgroup3
performed within the average range but not as well as Subgroup1, used
semantic clustering and had the most perseverative errors. All subgroups
were comprised of TD and EPI children; however, a majority (52%) of
TD fell in Subgroup1 while the EPI children were distributed across the
subgroups (31%, 40%, 29%). Children in the best performing group
had higher IQ and EPI in Subgroup2 were taking more antiepileptic
medication.
Conclusions: We delineated three learning profiles within the CVLT-C.
The best performing group tended to use a serial strategy. However,
recall that was limited to the end of the list was associated with worse
performance. Applying this novel approach across other populations
may reveal other learning profiles.

N. OFEN. Assessing the Relationship Between Episodic Memory
and the Volume of the Hippocampus in Young Children Born
Prematurely.
Objective: The hippocampus is essential for episodic memory. Preterm
birth is associated both with deficits in episodic memory and with alteration on hippocampal structure; however, the effect of term status on
the relation between episodic memory and hippocampal volume (HCV)
is unclear. We studied the relation between episodic memory and HCV
in young children born prematurely.

Forty Fourth Annual INS Meeting Abstracts
Participants and Methods: Thirty-four children ages 5-6 (15 born
preterm, PT; 19 born at term, FT) completed MRI scan and 3 episodic memory tasks: NIH Picture Sequencing (PS), WPPSI-IV Picture
Memory (PicMem), and a picture-pair recognition task. In the PS task,
participants recalled the order and location of a set of images. In the
PicMem task, participants identified target images from a larger set
of images. In the picture-pair task, participants identified single (item
test) or accurate pairings (pair-associate test) of studied picture-pairs.
Accuracy was calculated in all tasks. HCV was estimated from manual
tracing on high-resolution whole-brain structural images and volumes
were adjusted for total intracranial volume via ANOVA.
Results: In this sample, we found that the PT group performed significantly better on both the item and pair-associate tests of the picture-pair
task. There were no group differences for PS or PicMem. Moreover,
there were no group differences in IQ or demographic characteristics.
HCV was significantly larger in the PT compared to the FT group.
HCV was positively correlated with accuracy on the PS task in FT but
not PT group. In contrast, there was a trend for a negative correlation
between HCV and accuracy in the item test of the picture-pair task in
PT but not FT group.
Conclusions: Taken together, our findings suggest that there is a differential relationship between HCV and performance on tasks that assess episodic memory. Moreover, our findings suggest that relationship
between HCV and performance in tasks that assess episodic memory
may be different in children that were born preterm compared to those
born at term.

Effects of Sleep Quality and Glucoregulation on Sustained
Attention, Working Memory, and Inhibitory Control in Healthy
Young Adults.
Objective: Recent work shows poor sleep may lead to reduced glucoregulation. Poor seep quality and glucoregulation, even when subclinical,
are both associated with reduced attention and executive functioning.
We hypothesized that sleep quality and glucoregulation would interact,
such that those demonstrating subclinical deficits in both areas would
show greater cognitive impairment than those with either burden alone.
Participants and Methods: 79 healthy young adults (age M=20.99,
SD=2.36) participated. Glucose was taken via fingerstick at 8-hr fasted
baseline, followed by cognitive testing and questionnaires. Cognitive
tasks were ANAM4 Go/No-Go (GNG), Running Memory Continuous
Performance Test (RMCPT) and Standard Continuous Performance
Test (SCPT).
Results: 2x2 MANOVAs examined sleep quality by glucoregulation
for each test given (GNG, RMCPT, SCPT). A main effect of glucoregulation group [λ=0.88, F(3,70)=3.30; p=.03] was observed on the
GNG, such that greater mean reaction time [F (1,72)=6.62; p=.01] and
reaction time variability [F (1,72)=4.72; p=.03] emerged in the better
glucoregulation group. A main effect of sleep quality group [λ=0.99,
F(2,71)=3.10; p=.05] was observed on the RMCPT, with greater mean
reaction time [F (1,72)=5.38; p=.02] in the good sleep quality group.
No effects emerged on the SCPT, and no interactions were observed.
Conclusions: Contrary to our hypothesis, no interaction was observed,
though individuals with better sleep quality and glucoregulation showed
slower and more variable reaction times. Considering our relatively
healthy sample, it is possible that those with subclinical sleep or glucoregulation problems were more focused in order to counteract these
health deficits. Future research would benefit from the use of clinical
samples and prospective design to determine whether subclinical health
insults lead to this compensatory mechanism.

Working Memory Mediates the Relationship Between Aging
and Memory Performance in Older Adults with Heterogeneous
Cognitive Background.
Objective: The objective of the current study is to investigate whether
working memory mediates the relationship between age and memory
recall in a heterogeneous sample of older adults.
Participants and Methods: We evaluated 261 older adults (145 female) that were divided into three groups: control group (n=73) composed by older adults with no evidence of cognitive impairment, patients
with mild cognitive impairment (MCI; n=88), and patients with mild
Alzheimer’s disease (AD; n=88). The participants underwent a comprehensive neuropsychological evaluation that included also the Rey
Auditory Learning Test (RAVLT) and the Digit Span Test. The A1 score
from the RAVLT was used as measure of short-term memory, the A7 as
measure of episodic memory, and the backward order of the Digit span
as measure of verbal working memory. We normalized the sociodemographic and neuropsychological scores with a log-transformation, once
they did not follow a normal distribution, to conduct the analyses. We
evaluated the mediation effect of working memory on short-term and
episodic memory through simple mediation models using the macro
PROCESS to estimate the direct and indirect effect of age on memory.
In the model A, the outcome variable was the A1 score from RAVLT and
in model B we used the A7 score from RAVLT as the outcome measure.
These analyses were conducted with the whole sample.
Results: All variables correlated significantly. The mediation analyses
showed a partial mediation effect of working memory in the relationship
between age and short-term memory (model A: point estimate= -0.0012,
95% bias corrected CI=-0.0027 to -0.0004) and also in the relationship
between age and episodic memory (model B: point estimate= -0.016,
95% bias corrected CI= -0.0035 to -0.0004).
Conclusions: The present results indicate that the performance on
memory function is partially mediated by working memory. Interventions focusing on improvement of working memory performance may be
beneficial in older adults with varying degrees of memory impairment.

Longitudinal Assessment of Verbal Learning in Patients with
Psychotic Disorders.
Objective: The goal of the current study was to compare the verbal
learning ability of patients with psychotic bipolar disorder to patients
with schizophrenia spectrum disorders and patients with psychotic major depressive disorder (MDD).
Participants and Methods: Data was drawn from the Suffolk County
Mental Health Project (SCMHP), a large-scale epidemiological study of
patients with first episode psychosis. Verbal learning was assessed with
the Verbal Paired Associates I subtest of the WMS-R 2 years following
the index episode of psychosis, and was assessed again with the CVLT
10 years after the index episode. T-scores were calculated for each
participant that completed both assessments to allow for longitudinal
investigation of verbal learning ability, in addition to cross-sectional
comparison of verbal learning ability between groups at the 10-year
follow-up.
Results: A decade after onset of psychosis, individuals with psychotic
bipolar disorder (N = 47) performed significantly better on a verbal
learning test than individuals with schizophrenia (N = 99). Their performance was not significantly different from that of individuals with
psychotic MDD (N = 19). There were no group differences in trajectory
of change over time when controlling for covariates (age, gender, education, race, and general intelligence). All groups demonstrated decline
over time, but this decline was not significantly different from 0. The
average performance of each group on the CVLT was significantly below
population norms.

Conclusions: In a group of patients with first-episode psychosis, relative
differences in verbal learning ability among patients with schizophrenia
and psychotic affective disorders were maintained over the course of 8
years (Mojtabai, 2000), with no patient group showing greater decline
in performance than another. These results suggest that verbal learning
deficits may be related to transdiagnostic processes, rather than being
specific to particular disorders.

K. DHIMA, H. WADSWORTH & L.H. LACRITZ. Processing Speed
as a Predictor of Memory Performance in Multiple Sclerosis,
Parkinson’s Disease, and Alzheimer’s Disease.
Objective: To examine the differential contribution of processing speed
to memory performance in multiple sclerosis (MS), Parkinson’s disease
(PD), and Alzheimer’s disease (AD).
Participants and Methods: Individuals with MS [n=115,
Mage=45.70(9.90), Medu=14.73(2.53)], PD [n=128,
Mage=65.08(10.66), Medu=13.14(3.07)], and AD [n=208,
Mage=72.62(8.94), Medu=13.34(3.31)] were administered the WAISIII Digit Symbol (DSym) and California Verbal Learning Test (CVLT)
as part of a larger neuropsychological evaluation for clinical purposes.
Linear regressions were performed to examine the role processing
speed (DSym standard score) plays in learning (CVLT Total Trials
1-5 T-score) and memory (CVLT Long Delay Free Recall Z-score)
across groups.
Results: Regression analyses were significant across groups. DSym accounted for 37% of the variance in total learning in the MS sample [F(1,
113)=65.58, p<.001], 26% of the variance in PD [F(1, 126)=45.00,
p<.001], and 18% of the variance in AD [F(1, 206)=45.67, p<.001].
Regarding memory, DSym performance accounted for 25% of the variance in the MS sample [F(1, 113)=36.71, p<.001], 18% of the variance
in PD [F(1, 126)=28.50, p<.001], and 5% of the variance in AD [F(1,
206)=9.88, p<.01].
Conclusions: DSym performance significantly predicted CVLT total
learning and memory performance in all three samples, accounting for
more variance in learning than in memory. In addition, the association
was greatest in MS, followed by PD, and then AD. This study provides
further support that processing speed contributes to verbal learning and
memory, particularly in subcortical disorders. Further investigation is
warranted to understand the specific mechanisms at work.

J.H. FEINBERG, J. MOSES, R. GOMEZ & B. BONGAR. Visual
Memory Errors and Language Functioning: A Factorial Analysis
of BVRT Memory Errors, WAIS-III, and MAE Subtests.
Objective: The objective was to examine the relationship between Benton Visual Retention Test errors and the four spoken language subtests
of the Multilingual Aphasia Examination and a four-factor solution of
intelligence from the WAIS-III.
Participants and Methods: Subjects included (N = 507) are male
veterans from a mixed neuropsychiatric population at the VA Palo Alto.
The method utilized is a series of principal component analyses (PCA)
with Equimax rotation.
Results: The first PCA included raw score of all BVRT errors, which had
a 2 component structure. The first included Distortions, Misplacements,
Rotations, Perseverations and Size Errors, primarily of misperception
(i.e. distorting the objects). The second included Omissions, Size Errors,
and Misplacements, primarily errors of omission (i.e. forgetting all or
details of the design). Factor scales were created from this analysis using
the regression method. The second PCA included the two factor scores
of BVRT errors with the spoken language subtests of the MAE (Sentence Repetition, COWA, Token Test, and Visual Naming). The errors

of misperception loaded with Sentence Repetition, Token Test, and
Visual Naming, while the errors of omission loaded with COWA. A final
analysis examined the BVRT error factors with a four factor solution of
the WAIS-III using raw scores (Verbal Comprehension, Perceptual Organization, Working Memory, and Processing Speed), with age and level
of education included. This found that BVRT errors of omission loaded
most strongly with Perceptual Organization and Processing Speed, while
errors of misperception loaded with verbal comprehension.
Conclusions: We found that BVRT errors load on to two factors, one
which is primarily errors of misperception and the other is errors of
omission. The misperception error factor loaded most strongly with
measures of language, indicating these errors or more likely due to a
breakdown in verbal mediation. The omission error factor loaded more
strongly with processing speed and executive functioning.

D.C. DELIS & P. GILBERT. Recognition Discriminability in
Huntington’s and Alzheimer’s Disease.
Objective: Huntington’s disease (HD) and Alzheimer’s disease (AD)
are associated with distinct memory profiles that are partly reflected
by differences in recognition memory function. The first and second
editions of the California Verbal Learning Test (CVLT) provide an
index of total recognition discriminability (TRD) using nonparametric
and parametric formulas, respectively. Our objective was to examine
the degree to which these formulas similarly characterize TRD within
and between HD and AD patients.
Participants and Methods: The CVLT-Second Edition (CVLT-II) was
administered to 66 HD patients, 33 AD patients, 68 healthy middle-aged
adults, and 35 healthy older adults. Raw TRD scores were calculated
using nonparametric and parametric formulas. Raw and standardized
false positive (FP) rates also were calculated.
Results: Analysis of variance and covariance tests revealed that the HD
and AD groups had significantly lower TRD scores with both formulas
and higher raw and standardized FP rates than the healthy adult groups
(ps<.05). In the comparison of HD to healthy middle-aged adults, the
effect size associated with the parametric formula was 24% larger than
the effect size associated with the nonparametric formula. The two formulas yielded comparable effect sizes in the comparison of AD to healthy
older adults. The AD group had significantly lower TRD scores using
both formulas and higher raw and standardized FP rates than the HD
group (ps<.05). However, standardized parametric TRD scores were
comparable between the HD and AD groups.
Conclusions: The parametric formula for TRD used in the CVLT-II
may capture certain group differences to a larger degree than the nonparametric formula without yielding different conclusions regarding
TRD within and between HD and AD populations. Additionally, interpreting TRD scores in the context of FP rates may yield a more
thorough assessment of recognition memory, particularly in individuals
with suspected AD.

of Organization to ROCF Recall in Idiopathic Parkinson’s Disease
Beyond Processing Speed and Motor Abilities.
Objective: The Rey-Osterrieth Complex Figure (ROCF) is administered
clinically to assess learning and memory for complex visual information.
Yet the task requires organization, in that better organization contributes to better delay recall. For Parkinson’s disease (PD), it is unknown
if organizational ability is unique from that of the motor and processing
speed components. After controlling for age and education, we examined

Forty Fourth Annual INS Meeting Abstracts
the relative contribution of motor performance, processing speed, and
ROCF copy organizational ability on delay recall.
Participants and Methods: Non-demented individuals with idiopathic
PD (N=58), Hoehn and Yahr of 1-3, and controls (N=42) completed
the ROCF as well as measures of processing speed (WAIS-III Processing
Speed Index) and motor measures [Unified Parkinson’s disease Rating
Scale (UPDRS); Finger Tapping]. The ROCF was assessed for organization from the copy condition flowchart using Savage (1999) criteria.
Results: Individuals with PD scored an average of 10 points lower
for the ROCF Delay (p<0.01) relative to their non-PD peers. Mean
UPDRS- Motor score for the PD sample was approximately 19. Hierarchical linear regression models controlling for age and education were
used to predict ROCF Delay. Significant predictors for the PD sample
included education (p<.05), PSI (p<.05), and organization (p<.01).
Overall model explained 29% of the variance. The model predicting
non-PD peers found only organization (p<.01) to be a significant predictor of ROCF recall.
Conclusions: ROCF copy organization, while important for recall in
PD and non-PD samples, is particularly predictive beyond previously
found predictors such as processing speed and motor abilities. Future
research might investigate other top-down processes similar to organization as they may have significant unique association to recall of
individuals with PD.

Associations Among a Task of Prospective Memory, Executive
Functions, and Impulsivity within a Non-Clinical Sample.
Objective: Prospective memory (PM) or “remembering to remember”
has previously been studied within the context of Executive Functioning
(EF). Deficits in PM are associated with impaired executive functioning in clinical populations (e.g., HIV, substance users). More recently,
the relationship between PM and Impulsivity has been investigated in
non-clinical samples. This study builds upon previous research and
investigates the relationships among PM, EF, and Impulsivity in a
non-clinical sample.
Participants and Methods: Undergraduates (N = 109; Females = 79)
completed a Complex Prospective Memory Task including Time and
Event based cues, three tasks of EF: Mazes (planning), Stroop (inhibition), and Trail Making Task (switching), and the Impulsivity scale
UPPS-P (i.e., Negative Urgency, Perseverance, Premeditation, Sensation
Seeking, and Positive Urgency). Correlational analyses were used to
examine the associations among constructs.
Results: One notable significant correlation was found between PM and
EF, which was between the composite Time-based cue and Mazes (r =
.210, p = .028). Significant correlations between the subscales of the
UPPS-P and PM included, Negative Urgency and Time-based cue (r =
.197, p = .040) and Positive Urgency and Time-based cue (r = .232,
p = .016). The correlation between Positive Urgency and Event-based
cue was negatively trending (r = -.194, p = .060). Lastly, Perseverance
(Impulsivity) was significantly negatively correlated with Stroop (EF)
(r = -.216, p = .026).
Conclusions: Negative and Positive Urgency were the two subscales of
the UPPS-P found to be correlated with the PM task. Of the three EF
tasks, only the planning measure, Mazes, was significantly correlated
with PM. Perseverance, a component of Impulsivity was negatively associated with the Stroop task. Results suggest that even within a non-clinical sample, associations are found among the three variables.

Contributions of Executive Functioning to Spatial Navigation
Performance.
Objective: To identify associations between executive functioning and
performance on a spatial navigation task.
Participants and Methods: Fifty-six college-aged adults (9 males, 47
females; M age = 22.9) completed a spatial navigation task and brief
neuropsychological battery. The virtual Morris Water Task (vMWT),
a computerized, translational version of the classic paradigm used to
investigate place learning and memory in rodents, was used to assess
spatial navigation abilities. The vMWT requires participants to search
a large pool to find a hidden escape platform; proximal and distal environmental cues are available to aid navigation. Lower time to find
the hidden platform, fewer path intersections, and lower percentage of
search path that was retraced are measures of more effective navigation.
Neuropsychological tests included the Mental Rotations Task (MRT)
and the Delis-Kaplan Executive Function System (D-KEFS) Tower,
Verbal Fluency, and Color-Word Interference subtests.
Results: Worse performance on vMWT was associated with worse executive function: 1) longer latency to locate the platform was associated
with lower performance on tests of category switching and color-word
interference (p’s < .05); 2) higher path retrace was associated with
lower category fluency and category switching (p’s < .05). There was
a non-significant trend for an association between more vMWT path
intersections and a higher percentage of errors on the MRT (p = .1).
Conclusions: Prior research has focused on associations between spatial navigation performance and neuropsychological tests of memory
and visuospatial abilities. This study highlights the role of executive
resources (e.g., planning, monitoring, set switching) in preparing, selecting, and employing effective search strategies to efficiently navigate
a virtual environment. Given that executive functioning declines during
aging, these findings may inform future investigations of age-related
differences in spatial navigation.

S.W. LARSON, J.M. CONSTANCE & M.Y. KIBBY. How does having
Comorbid ADHD affect Memory Deficits in Children with Reading
Disorders?
Objective: Prior research suggests children with Reading Disorders
(RD) have poor verbal STM, intact visual STM (when material cannot be
verbally coded), and intact LTM for both modalities (when controlling
for initial encoding). Children with ADHD have poor visual-spatial
STM, but the rest of STM and LTM may be intact.
Participants and Methods: Data were collected as part of larger, NIH/
NICHD-funded studies (R03 HD048752, R15 HD065627). Children,
ages 8 to 12 years, with RD (N=38), RD/ADHD (N=40) or typically
developing controls (N=70) were administered select subtests from the
Children’s Memory Scale (CMS) including Dot Locations, Stories, and
Word Lists. Children with auditory processing, language, or other psychiatric or neurologic disorders were excluded.
Results: Transformations were performed on Dot Locations-Immediate Recall and Word Lists-Delayed Recognition to remove skewed
distributions. MANOVA was used to test STM and LTM performance
as a function of diagnostic group. Results were significant for all three
modalities: STM – Wilks’ Λ=.717, F(6,280)=8.453, p<.001; LTM –
Wilks’ Λ=.754, F(6,278)=7.011, p<.001; Recognition – Wilks’ Λ=.764,
F(4,278)=9.996, p<.001. In all cases the RD and RD/ADHD groups performed worse than controls but comparably to each other. Nonetheless,
scores on semantic and visual measures were Average.
Linear regressions were run predicting delayed recall performance from
STM scores, and then a MANOVA was utilized on the residuals. When
controlling for initial encoding, there was no difference in delayed recall
between groups, Wilks’ Λ=.999, F(5,268)=.013, p=1.00. Univariate
analyses revealed similar findings (ps>.980).

24
Conclusions: Our findings support previous work noting worse rote
verbal STM in RD and RD/ADHD, however, this deficit appears specific
to RD. LTM was intact when controlling for initial encoding. Further
research is needed to determine why some children with ADHD have
visual-spatial STM deficits and some with RD/ADHD do not.

S. MARKOWSKI, A. ALKOZEI & W.D. KILLGORE. Greater
Neuroticism Predicts Higher Performance in Immediate Memory,
Language, and Attention in Healthy Individuals.
Objective: Individuals high in the trait of neuroticism tend to experience
high levels of anxiety and negative emotion. Recent studies have suggested that self-report measures of traits like neuroticism are associated
with some aspects of neurocognitive performance but not others, but
their specificity is still poorly understood. Here we examined the association between the trait of neuroticism and performance on a widely
used measure of neuropsychological functioning, the Repeatable Battery
for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status Update (RBANS), in
a healthy sample.
Participants and Methods: Forty-six healthy individuals (females=23,
M age = 25, range = 20-43) completed the NEO Personality Inventory,
Revised (NEO PI-R), and the RBANS. Stepwise and backward multiple
regression analyses were used to examine the relationships between
neuroticism and neurocognitive performance on the RBANS.
Results: Neuroticism showed a positive association with total RBANS
scores, accounted for 23% of the variance (R2 =.231, p=.001). Furthermore, higher levels of neuroticism were found to be significantly
positively correlated with Immediate memory (R2 =.274, p < .001),
Language (R2 =.179, p=.004), and Attention (R2=.093, p=.042), but
not Visuospatial/Constructional or delayed memory performances.
Conclusions: Higher scores on the trait of neuroticism were found
to predict better cognitive performance on neuropsychological capacities requiring working memory, attention, and language skills. Prior
work has suggested that neuroticism may correlate with some aspects
of executive functioning, raising the possibility that this trait may be
linked with systems regulated by the prefrontal cortex. Future work will
need to examine how these associations may differ between healthy and
clinical populations.

R.A. SPERLING & P. VANNINI. Mapping the Metabolic Correlates
of Subjective Memory Concerns in Cognitively Normal Elderly
Individuals.
Objective: Subjective memory concerns (SMC) are common in older
adults (Jonker et al. 2000), despite performing well on objective memory
tests. Whereas the pathophysiological correlates of objective memory
impairment has been investigated in the clinical stages of Alzheimer’s
disease (AD), little is known about the pathological underpinnings of
SMC. Here, we used resting state FDG-PET to map the metabolic correlates of SMC in a group of cognitively normal elderly subjects.
Participants and Methods: 283 elderly individuals (165 female; mean
age 73.4 years; CDR=0) participated in the Harvard Aging Brain Study
(Dagley et al. 2015). SMC were measured using the Memory Functioning Questionnaire (Gilewski et al., 1990), where a lower score reflects
increased complaints. Whole-brain FDG-PET images were analyzed
as standard uptake volume ratios, using cerebellum (gray matter only)
as reference. Voxel-wise correlations between FDG-PET, SMC, and
objective memory performance (Logical memory, Wechsler Memory
scale (Wechsler, 1981)) were conducted controlling for age. A statistical

threshold of p<0.005 correcting for multiple comparisons using a cluster
extent of k>426 voxels (FWE-correction) was applied.
Results: The exploratory analysis revealed that SMC correlated with
decreased FDG metabolism in bilateral precuneus (PC), bilateral inferior parietal lobes, right inferior temporal lobe, right medial frontal
gyrus, and the right orbitofrontal gyrus (OFG). No regional hypometabolism was observed when correlating objective memory performance
with FDG-PET.
Conclusions: These results provide further evidence that increased
memory concerns in older adults are related to functional changes within
cortical regions involved in self-referential processes (e.g PC, OFG). In
contrast, no changes were observed with objective memory performance,
indicating that SMC may be an important early indicator of pathophysiological changes occurring before observable memory decline.

D.A. NATION, M.W. BONDI, E. GAYLES & D.C. DELIS. Cognitive
Effects of High Altitude Exposure in Military Pilots and Aircrew.
Objective: Cognitive dysfunction resulting from high altitude exposure
is a major cause of civilian and military air disasters. Pilot training programs are designed to improve the recognition of signs and symptoms
of moderate-to-high altitude exposure (8,000-20,000 ft) prior to the
induction of severe cognitive and motor deficits that may result in the
loss of aircraft control. Little is known regarding the nature of cognitive impairments manifesting within this critical altitude window where
lifesaving measures may still be taken.
Participants and Methods: In a series of experiments, 9 to 17 military
aircrew and pilots underwent neuropsychological testing before, during,
and after exposure to high altitude environment in a pressure-controlled
chamber. A modified version of the CVLT-2 was used to adapt testing
to a pressure-controlled environment. The test consisted of two learning
trials and delayed recall with written responses, followed by recognition testing. Paired t-tests were used to compare performance across
experimental conditions.
Results: In our experiments, brief (~15 min) exposure to high altitude
environment (20,000 ft) caused a rapid reduction in verbal learning
(Trial 2, p<.001) and memory ability (delayed recall, p<.001) with
relative preservation of auditory attention (Trial 1, p>.20). Memory for
the word list learned during exposure did not improve after a washout
period at sea level conditions. Retrieval of word list memory learned
shortly before exposure was also impaired during altitude exposure,
p<.001.
Conclusions: These findings suggest that memory encoding and retrieval deficits may be rapidly induced upon high altitude exposure,
despite relative preservation of basic auditory attention. Memory deficits could greatly impact lifesaving situational awareness and response,
and may represent a major factor in determining survival of military
aircrew and pilots.

J. NOVITSKI & M. SEIDENBERG. Relationship between
Contextual Recall and Semantic Fluency Performance in Healthy
Older Adults and Mild Cognitive Impairment.
Objective: It is increasingly evident that the distinction between episodic
and semantic memory is more aptly described as a continuum rather
than a binary construct. The availability of specific personal contextual
information in a memory recollection is considered to reflect the extent
of engagement of episodic memory processes. We compared contextual
recall for the first and last word produced by healthy control (HC) and
Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) groups for three semantic categories:
autobiographical, spatial, and non-episodic.

Forty Fourth Annual INS Meeting Abstracts
Participants and Methods: Forty-four participants, 27 healthy controls (mean age = 78, education = 15 years) and 17 individuals with MCI
or mild Alzheimer’s disease (mean age = 81, education = 15 years) were
recruited for this study. Participants were given 60 seconds to generate
items for each fluency, after which they were asked to provide personal
contextual information for the first and last fluency item (e.g., “when/
where/with whom were you when you last saw this animal?”).
Results: The MCI group produced less contextual information than the
HC group for all three semantic categories (p < 0.05). However, both
groups provided more contextual information for the first word than
the last word. Increased number of items generated in the first, but not
the last, 15-second fluency interval was associated with better performance on episodic memory measures. Also, increased contextual recall
was associated with better performance on episodic memory measures
(all p’s < 0.05).
Conclusions: Contextual recall for items generated on semantic fluency
measures is impaired in MCIs compared to cognitively intact healthy
controls. The first fluency item elicited more contextual information
than the last item, and fluency performance in the first 15-seconds
correlated with episodic memory performance. These findings suggest
that episodic memory processes may be more engaged in the initial
search and retrieval involved in generating words for semantic fluency
measures.

Association of motor function and cognitive performance in a
sample of older adults with and without Parkinson’s disease.
Objective: Although motor impairment is associated with cognitive
decline, it is unclear whether extrapyramidal motor movements or pyramidal motor movements are a better predictor of such decline. This
study assessed the cross-sectional association of motor function (extrapyramidal vs. pyramidal) to cognitive performance.
Participants and Methods: This study focused on the characterization
of memory impairment in older adults (aged 60 and above) with and
without Parkinson’s disease (PD). Participants were recruited from NYU
Langone Medical Center registries and the community. The sample
included 10 individuals with mild cognitive impairment, 20 with PD
and no cognitive impairment, 18 with PD and cognitive impairment,
30 healthy controls. Extrapyramidal functioning was assessed using
the Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) and pyramidal
motor functioning was assessed using a timed walk of 50 feet. The
Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status
(RBANS) was used to assess cognition. A general linear model was
conducted adjusting for age, gender, race, education, PD diagnosis,
health, depression.
Results: Results revealed an inverse relationship between the RBANS
list total raw score and both UPDRS score (p .029) and walking time
(p .018), with a larger effect size for the UPDRS (-.856 vs. -.520). An
inverse relationship was observed between walking time and RBANS
immediate memory index score (p .037).
Conclusions: Extrapyramidal and pyramidal motor impairment are
associated with verbal memory decline, with a larger association for
extrapyramidal motor movements. This may indicate that involuntary
motor impairment associated with basal ganglia function is a stronger
indicator of future cognitive impairment than voluntary motor movement associated with corticospinal tract function. Findings may aid
researchers to better understand the relationship between subcortical
nuclei and cognitive-motor functioning and assist clinicians to better
identify patients in the early or presymptomatic stage.

S. RASKIN, M. RACE & E. AISENBERG. Psychometric Properties
of the Memory for Intentions Test-Short Form.
Objective: The Memory for Intentions Screening Test (MIST) has
proven to be a useful clinical tool in a wide variety of populations as a
measure of prospective memory (PM). However, it can be too lengthy
for many standard clinical assessments. Therefore, the MIST-SF was
created to allow for a briefer screening measure.
Participants and Methods: A total of 25 individuals were administered the MIST-SF. They were 14 female and 11 male. Ages ranged
from 18 to 70 (mean=33.56, s.d.=18.53). Education ranged in years
from 11-25 years (mean=16.16, s.d.=3.06). All participants agreed to
participate with a consent form approved by the Trinity Institutional
Review Board. All participants were administered the MIST-SF with a
background questionnaire as the ongoing task. Total testing time for
the MIST-SF was 18 minutes. The MIST-SF has a total of four items.
Two are time-based and two are event-based. Two have a delay period
of 2 minutes and two have a delay period of 15 minutes. There are also
two 24 hour delay items, one time-based and one event-based. Each of
the items is taken from the original MIST.
Results: The MIST-SF was successfully administered to a group of
healthy participants with no floor or ceiling effects. Mean total score was
22.20 (s.d.=2.27) out of a possible 24. The reliability of the MIST-SF in
terms of internal consistency was sufficient when analyzing the
individual MIST-SF trials (Chronbach’s alpha= 0.90), as was split- half
reliability (split- half reliability = 0.86). Given that the items are taken
directly from the MIST, which has already shown high validity, this
was not evaluated.
Conclusions: A variety of potential neuropsychological measures were
tried in the delay period but only self-report questionnaires proved to
be useable. Using a background information questionnaire or a prospective memory questionnaire in the delay period were both effective.
The MIST-SF appears to be a valid and reliable measure of PM. Further testing with people who have neurological disorders will help to
determine its specificity.

tested the hypothesis that individuals with severe and mild BI would
demonstrate deficits in PM on a clinical measure and would show reduction in amplitude of markers of PM on an ERP task.
Participants and Methods: All participants were undergraduate students. Ten healthy adults (HA), 5 severe BI (SBI) and 14 mild BI (MBI)
still experiencing symptoms. All were between 18-23 years of age and
12-18 years of education. All participants were given the Memory for Intentions Screening Test (MIST) and ERP paradigm patterned after West
and Munroe (2002). This was an ongoing semantic category judgment
with PM trials interspersed. Electrophysiological recording took place
with a 32 channel Electro-cap and a Synamps amplifier.
Results: MIST total score demonstrated a significant difference between
the HA and the SBI group such that the SBI group performed significantly more poorly. The group with MBI did not differ from the other
two groups. The same pattern was demonstrated on MIST PM errors. On
the computerized measure PM accuracy the MBI group was significantly
different from the other groups with a score that fell in between them.
On the electrophysiological measures there were significant differences
between all three groups on the N300 waveform with the MBI group
showing the greatest negative amplitude. The LPC showed significant
differences between the groups only for ongoing trials and realized intentions but not for unrealized intentions. There were no differences
between the groups for formation slow wave.

26
Conclusions: The MIST was designed as a clinical measure of PM and
may not be sensitive enough to deficits after MBI, as indicated by the
computerized measure. It is interesting that the MBI group showed deficits in successful PM remembering but also greater activation of N300.
This may suggest that greater activation is required to form an intention.

K.S. TALBOT, U. MÜLLER & K.A. KERNS. Investigating General
Time-Based Prospective Memory in Children Using a Novel
Naturalistic Paradigm.
Objective: Prospective memory (PM) is essential for successful daily
functioning, yet few researchers have examined PM in a naturalistic
way especially in children. The current study aimed to understand a
particular form of PM, general time-based prospective memory (TBPM),
in children using a novel naturalistic paradigm. General TBPM is a
memory for action that is carried out within a general time frame (e.g.
sometime Monday). The study also aimed to add to the current PM
literature by including an analysis of the circumstances surrounding
prospective remembering.
Participants and Methods: Twenty-nine children (aged 7-13) completed the two part study. First, children completed the WASI-II, a labbased PM measure (MISTY), and two working memory (WM) measures.
Parents also completed a parent-report questionnaire of their child’s
everyday PM and RM failures (PRMQC). Next, children completed a
novel TBPM task with their parents on 6 ‘target days’.
Results: General TBPM did not significantly relate to the PRMQC,
the overall scores on the MISTY, or MISTY TBPM subscores. WM was
found to significantly relate to both MISTY-PM [r = .614, p < .001]
and MISTY-TBPM [r = .620, p < .001], but not to general TBPM [r =
-.142, p > .05), though controlling for age resulted in non-significant
correlations between WM and the PM measures. Additionally, the psychometric properties of the PM measures will be discussed. Finally,
when children remembered the general TBPM tasks, they often did so
spontaneously (70%). However, when they forgot, most often it was
because they were ‘too busy’ (47%).
Conclusions: The current findings provide preliminary support for the
importance of investigating general TBPM in a naturalistic setting. More
research is needed to properly evaluate the ecological validity of this
novel general TBPM paradigm. Finally, it is believed that the inclusion
of qualitative measures assessing the context of PM retrieval has important implications for the effective development of future interventions
for children with PM difficulties.

Convergent Validity of the Poreh Nonverbal Memory Test.
Objective: The present study examined performance on a new measure
of nonverbal memory called the Poreh Nonverbal Memory Test. The
Poreh Nonverbal Memory Test is a computerized test which requires
participants to click on boxes in 9 different geometric designs in search
of a red square. When found the participants are supposed to try to
remember the location of the red square. Participants are presented with
the geometric designs 5 times and then once more after a 30 minute
delay. The objective of the present study was to establish the convergent
validity of the Poreh Nonverbal Memory Test by comparing results to
results on the Biber Figure Learning Test using correlational analysis.
It was expected that a significant negative correlation would be found.
Participants and Methods: 60 Participants (33 female) were recruited
from the North East Ohio area. The age of participants ranged from
18-78. Participants’ years of education ranged from 11-22 years. Two
participants were eliminated because of lack of effort. Participants were
administered the Poreh Nonverbal Memory Test and the Biber Figure
Learning Test in a pseudorandom order.

Results: A correlational analysis was performed on all trial scores of
the Poreh Nonverbal Memory Test and the Biber Figure Learning Test
as well as the overall test scores. It was found that trials 2, 3 and 4
correlate at the p=.05 level. Total test scores correlated significantly,
r=-.415, p<.001. It was also found that the Poreh Nonverbal Memory
Test simple (symmetrical) designs learning score correlated with the
Biber Figure Learning Test total score r=-.410, p<.001.
Conclusions: The results of the present study suggest that the Poreh
Nonverbal Memory Test is a good measure of nonverbal learning. The
fact the simple design learning sub-score correlates with the Biber Figure
Learning total score suggests that the simple designs are easily verbally
mediated. Future studies need to compare performance on the Poreh
Nonverbal Memory Test to performance on other tests of nonverbal
memory.

HIV/AIDS/Infectious Disease
M. GAMEZ, M. SARNO, A. ACEVEDO & R. OWNBY. Composite
Scores Increase Detection of Neurocognitive Impairment in the
HIV-Positive Native Spanish-Speaking Older Adult: A Pilot Study.
Objective: The rate of HIV/AIDS in Hispanic elders is five times higher
than that of their non-Hispanic Caucasian peers. Despite the introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), this overrepresentation and greater disease burden calls for examination of the combined
neurocognitive effects of HIV infection plus aging in this group. This
study examined whether older HIV+ native Spanish speakers exhibit
lower performance than their HIV- peers on five composite scores (2-4
measures per domain): verbal fluency, learning/memory, executive
functioning/working memory, psychomotor functioning, and cognitive
processing speed.
Participants and Methods: A neuropsychological battery was administered to 52 native Spanish speakers (27 HIV+; 25 HIV-) from 12 Latin
American countries, ages 50-74 (M=58.19±6.4), with 2-18 years of education (M=12.69±3.7). The HIV+ sample reported minimum HAART
adherence of one year and 67% of the sample had an undetectable viral
load. Exclusion criteria included preexisting neurological conditions and
significant substance use history. ANCOVAs were conducted with age
and education as covariates.
Results: The HIV+ group evidenced significant impairments on several
composite scores as compared to controls. Psychomotor Functioning,
Cognitive Processing Speed, and Executive Functioning/Working Memory domains evidenced significant group effects, F(1, 51)=6.79, p=.013,
F(1, 51)=6.39, p=.015, and F(1, 51)=5.02, p=.031, respectively.
Conclusions: Three of five composite scores show robust evidence of
neurocognitive impairment in the HIV+ sample. The findings are partially discrepant from those found in HIV+ English-speaking Caucasian older adults. This study provides implications for test sensitivity
and selection in detecting subtle HIV-associated neurocognitive deficits
among understudied native Spanish-speaking older HIV+ Hispanics.

performance than their HIV- peers on measures of attention, memory,
executive functioning, psychomotor speed, and information processing
speed.
Participants and Methods: A multi-domain neuropsychological battery was administered in Spanish to 52 Spanish-dominant Hispanics
(27 HIV+; 25 HIV-), ages 50-74 (M=58.19±6.4), with 2-18 years of
education (M=12.69±3.7), and 52% females. In the HIV+ sample, CD4
count ranged from 228-1741 (M=726.21±403.0), with undetectable
viral load in 67% of the sample. Exclusion criteria included preexisting
neurological conditions, head injury with loss of consciousness, and
significant substance use history. ANCOVAs were conducted with age
and education as covariates.
Results: The Stroop Color Word Test (SCWT) evidenced a significant
group effect on Color/Word performance F(1, 51)=12.72, p=.001. The
HIV+ group evidenced significant impairments on Color, Word, and
Color/Word Interference trials as compared to controls. Regarding psychomotor speed, the Finger Tapping Test (FTT) with both the Dominant and Non-Dominant hand evidenced a significant group effect, F(1,
51)=6.81, p=.013 and F(1, 51)=14.83, p<.0001, respectively.
Conclusions: The SCWT and FTT produced the most robust evidence
of neurocognitive impairment in the HIV+ sample, suggesting affected
executive functioning and psychomotor speed. The findings are partially
discrepant from those found in English-speaking Caucasian older adults.
This study provides preliminary evidence that these brief measures may
assist in detecting subtle HIV-associated neurocognitive deficits among
understudied Spanish-dominant HIV+ Hispanic older adults.

Poster Symposium 1. Predicting Postsurgical
Outcome Using Neuroimaging Markers in
Temporal Lobe Epilepsy
Organizer: Karol Osipowicz

Epilepsy/Seizures
K. OSIPOWICZ & J.I. TRACY. Predicting postsurgical outcome
using Neuroimaging Markers in Temporal Lobe Epilepsy.
Symposium Description: The proposed symposium includes three
presentations that examine the ability of neuroimaging biomarkers to
predict cognitive and seizure outcome following resective surgery for
intractable temporal lobe epilepsy. Predicting cognitive and seizure
outcomes following resective brain surgery is a critically important
clinical goal. Such work also has the potential to greatly increase our
understanding of brain plasticity responses, cognitive reorganization,
and factors predictive of cognitive recovery after brain injury or disease. Although neuroimaging in epilepsy is heavily reliant on structural
imaging, advances in multi-modal imaging techniques have opened up
a wealth of biomarkers that are, as of yet, untested. Here, we discuss
the use of advanced MRI analyses, including task-BOLD, resting-state,
and diffusion to predict both cognitive and seizure outcomes following
resective surgery, a technique which shows good short term, but much
less impressive long term, outcomes. More specifically, we will present
data demonstrating the use of graph-theory resting state analyses for
the prediction of cognitive outcomes; volumetric analyses of gray matter
used to predict seizure outcomes; and a study integrating fMRI, resting
state, and DTI to predict cognitive outcome. Each presentation will
cover the specific methods applied and results for each major analysis.

J.I. TRACY. Frontal Gray Matter Abnormalities Predict Seizure
Outcome in Refractory Temporal lobe Epilepsy Patients.
We investigated patients with refractory TLE before and after temporal
resection. We explored gray matter (GM) volume change in relation with
seizure outcome, using a voxel-based morphometry (VBM) approach. To
do so, this study was divided in two parts. The first one involved group
analysis of differences in regional GM volume between the groups (good
outcome (GO), e.g. no seizures after surgery; poor outcome (PO), e.g.
persistent postoperative seizures), controls, N=24 in each group), pre
and post-surgery. The second part of the study focused on pre-surgical
data only (N=61), determining whether the degree of GM abnormalities
can predict surgical outcomes. For this second step, GM abnormalities
were identified, within each lobe, in each patient when compared with
an ad hoc sample of age-matched controls. For the first analysis, the
results showed larger GM atrophy, mostly in the frontal lobe, in PO
patients, relative to both GO patients and controls, pre-surgery. When
comparing pre-to-post changes, we found relative GM gains in the GO
but not in the PO patients, mostly in the non-resected hemisphere. For
the second analysis, only the frontal lobe displayed reliable prediction
of seizure outcome. 81% of the patients showing pre-surgical increased
GM volume in the frontal lobe became seizure free, post-surgery; while
77% of the patients with pre-surgical reduced frontal GM volume had
refractory seizures, post-surgery. A regression analysis revealed that the
proportion of voxels with reduced frontal GM volume was a significant
predictor of seizure outcome (p=0.014). Importantly, having less than
1% of the frontal voxels with GM atrophy increased the likelihood of
being seizure-free, post-surgery, by seven times. Overall, our results
suggest that using pre-surgical GM abnormalities within the frontal lobe
is a reliable predictor of seizure outcome post-surgery in TLE.

J.I. TRACY. Pre-Surgery Resting-State local Graph-Theory
measures predict Neurocognitive Outcomes after Brain Surgery
in Temporal Lobe Epilepsy.
This study determined the ability of resting-state functional connectivity
(rsFC) graph-theory measures to predict neurocognitive status post-surgery in temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) patients who underwent an anterior temporal lobectomy (ATL).A pre-surgical imaging was collected in
16 left and 16 right TLE patients that underwent an ATL. Also, patients
received neuropsychological testing pre- and post-surgery in verbal and
non-verbal episodic memory, language, working memory, and attention domains. We investigated three graph-theory properties (local efficiency, distance, participation), measuring segregation, integration and
centrality, respectively. These measures were only computed in regions
of functional relevance to the ictal pathology, or the cognitive domain.
Linear regression analyses were computed to predict the change in each
neurocognitive domain. Our analyses revealed that cognitive outcome
was successfully predicted with at least 68% of the variance explained
in each model, for both TLE groups. The only model not significantly
predictive involved non-verbal episodic memory outcome in right TLE.
Measures involving the healthy hippocampus were the most common
among the predictors, suggesting enhanced integration of this structure
with the rest of the brain may improve cognitive outcomes. Regardless
of TLE group, left inferior frontal regions were the best predictors of
language outcome. Working memory outcome was mostly predicted by
right-sided regions, in both groups. Overall, the results indicated our
integration measure was the most predictive of neurocognitive outcome.
In contrast, our segregation measure was the least predictive. This study
provides evidence that pre-surgery rsFC measures may help determine
neurocognitive outcomes following ATL. The results are encouraging

K. OSIPOWICZ. fMRI, Resting State, and DTI Predict Verbal
Fluency Outcome Following Resective Surgery for Temporal Lobe
Epilepsy.
Predicting cognitive function following resective surgery remains an
important clinical goal. Each MRI neuroimaging techniques can potentially provide unique and distinct insight into changes that occur in the
structural or functional organization of “at risk” cognitive functions.
We test for the singular and combined power of three imaging techniques (functional magnetic resonance imaging, resting state functional
magnetic resonance imaging, diffusion tensor imaging) to predict cognitive outcome following left (dominant) anterior temporal lobectomy
for intractable epilepsy. We accomplish this by calculating the degree
of deviation from normal, determine the rate of change in this measure
across the pre and postsurgical imaging sessions, and then compare these
measures for their ability to predict verbal fluency changes following
surgery. Our data shows that the three neuroimaging techniques, in
a combined model, can reliably predict cognitive outcome following
anterior temporal lobectomy for medically intractable temporal lobe
epilepsy. These findings suggest that these three imaging modalities can
be used effectively, in an additive fashion, to predict functional reorganization and cognitive outcome following anterior temporal lobectomy.

B. DICKERSON. The Human Brain Connectome and Cognitive
and Affective Function: Normal Individual Variability, Aging, and
Neurodegeneration.
Modern neuroimaging techniques are providing revolutionary insights
into the human brain connectome. We are now able to study—in living
people—large-scale brain networks predicted from non-human primate
tract tracing investigations and lesion neuropsychology. I will review
knowledge of the localization and function of brain networks in the
healthy brain, and evidence that measures of these networks illuminate
individual differences in cognition, affect, and sensorimotor function.
The modulation of network connectivity in relation to task performance, pharmacologic manipulation, or brain stimulation is providing
new insights into neuroplasticity. Age-related cognitive decline may
be explained in part by a “compromised connectome”; older adults
lucky enough to be “superagers”—with youthful cognitive function—
have preserved anatomy in key nodes of large-scale cognitive-affective
brain networks. Patients with neurodegenerative diseases develop disconnection, dysfunction, and atrophy within brain networks subserving
cognitive, affective, and sensorimotor function related to symptoms of
their illness. Neurodegenerative diseases appear to progress in part by
following the pathways of the brain’s connectome.
Learning Objectives
As a result of attending this lecture, the participant will increase their
knowledge of:
Healthy human brain networks subserving normal brain function, and
Impaired network connectomics in aging and neurodegenerative disease.

R.F. WHITE. Chemical Exposures and the Nervous System:
Clinical Findings and Research Evidence.
Effects of exposures to substances with neurotoxic properties such as
heavy metals, organic solvents, pesticides/insecticides, and carbon
monoxide include behavioral and neuroimaging changes that can be
characterized both clinically and in epidemiologic research using neuropsychological and neuroimaging methods. The field of inquiry on these
effects is broadly known as behavioral toxicology and has advanced
significantly in the past 30 years. This workshop will briefly review
classes of known neurotoxicants and typical sources of exposure to them.
It will describe the methods by which particular substances become
identified as neurotoxic. Strategies for clinical assessment and for research investigations of exposure effects will be outlined. Research and
clinical examples will be provided, with a focus on metals and gases. The
limitations of clinical and research applications of neuropsychological

and neuroimaging methods will be explored, and current challenges and
future directions in the field of behavioral toxicology will be described.
Learning Objectives
The workshop will allow the learner to:
Name classes of neurotoxic substances, including specific examples of
them,
Understand strategies for clinical evaluation of patients with putative
exposures to neurotoxicants, including a clinical diagnostic system for
toxicant-induced disorders, and
Critically evaluate research literature on the neurotoxicity of chemicals
in humans.

M.W. BONDI. Mild Cognitive Impairment and Preclinical
Alzheimer’s Disease: Concepts in Need of Input from
Neuropsychology.
This workshop will present updated diagnostic criteria, with a focus on
the neuropsychological features of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and
preclinical Alzheimer’s disease (AD), in the context of the pathogenesis
of AD. Seeking to refine diagnostic and prediction models, in a series of
studies we have compared the conventional criteria, for example as operationalized by the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI),
and our actuarial neuropsychological method. Results from these studies
suggest that conventional criteria are susceptible to both false positive
and false negative diagnostic errors, whereas MCI participants diagnosed via neuropsychological criteria yield dissociable cognitive phenotypes, significant biomarker associations, more stable diagnoses, and
greater percentages who progress to dementia than conventional MCI
diagnostic criteria. We further extend this actuarial method to support
refinement of the research criteria for preclinical AD diagnosis. This
workshop reflects the research and clinical advances in identifying MCI,
examining its biomarker signatures, and offers new opportunities for
diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of AD in its prodromal period.
Learning Objectives
As a result of participation in this course, the learner will achieve the
following objectives:
Examine the relative value of biomarkers and cognitive measures to
diagnosis, and
Examine their roles in prediction of progression along the aging-MCI-AD
continuum.

K. ARES, J. KAYLEGIAN, L. KAIS & S. HUNTER. Homeless
Youths’ Self-Reported Executive Functioning as Mediated by
Traumatic Brain Injury Severity.
Objective: Traumatic brain injuries (TBI) are a frequent occurrence
among homeless youths, believed to be due to their risk for impulsivity
and poorer decision making (Gustafson, et al. 2013). Temperamental
negative affectivity (NA) has been shown to contribute to increased risk
for physical injury, including TBI (Corrigan, et al., 2010), and youths
who are homeless show greater levels of NA (Ares, et al, 2014). The
current study sought to examine whether severity of traumatic brain
injury mediates the relationship between homeless youths’ temperament
and self-reported executive functioning
Participants and Methods: A total of 93 homeless youths (50 females,
18-22 years of age, 71% African American), residing in two shelters in
Chicago, were divided into TBI severity groups.
Results: Analyses examined the relationship between NA, EF as assessed by BRIEF factor scores, and TBI. The overall regression for the
BRIEF Behavioral Regulation Index (BRI) was significant (R2=.133,

29
F(3, 84)=4.136, p=.009), indicating that the relationship between NA
and BRI may change depending on the level of head injury severity. Levels of NA were also found to significantly predict Metacognitive Index
scores, as did severity of TBI, and the interaction was significant (b=.157, p=.037). The overall BRIEF GEC regression was also significant
(R2=.147, F(3, 84)=4.640, p=.005), with NA significantly predicting
GEC scores and TBI severity. The relationship between temperament
and global EF in homeless youths is strongly mediated by the severity
of head injury historically experienced. For the no TBI and mild TBI
groups, results revealed that higher NA scores were accompanied by
greater executive dysfunction. However, for severe TBI, as NA increased,
fewer difficulties with EF were reported.
Conclusions: Results are discussed with regard to strategies for supporting homeless youths with TBI.

D.D. BOSENBARK, L. KRIVITZKY, R. ICHORD, L. JASTRZAB &
L. BILLINGHURST. Attention and Executive Functioning Profiles
in Children Following Perinatal Arterial Ischemic Stroke.
Objective: Prior research has documented a high incidence of Attention
Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)—a disorder characterized by
prominent impairments in attention and executive functioning (EF)—
among children with a history of perinatal arterial ischemic stroke
(PAIS), yet there has been no comprehensive investigation of the neuropsychological profile in these children. Clinical factors that may also
contribute to outcomes in these domains are largely understudied in this
population. We examined: 1) the neuropsychological profile of attention
and EF; and 2) the influence of clinical factors on outcomes in these
domains in children following PAIS.
Participants and Methods: Forty children born at term (≥37 weeks)
ages 3-16 (median age=7.2 years; 58% male) with PAIS underwent
neuropsychological battery (WPPSI-IV/WASI-II, NEPSY-II, TEA-Ch,
WMTB-C, TOL-Dx, TMT-A&B). Parents completed questionnaires
(ADHD-IV, BRIEF) regarding real-world functioning. Demographic
(age, sex) and clinical variables (lesion size, lesion location, presence of
epilepsy) were collected.
Results: Although intellectual performance was in the normative range
(mean = 94.38; SD = 15.90), it was statistically lower than FSIQ in
the normative sample. Measures of attention, verbal fluency, inhibitory
control, flexibility/shifting, planning/organizing, and processing speed
were significantly lower in children with PAIS than in the normative
sample (all p<0.001); working memory was not significantly different.
The presence of comorbid epilepsy, larger lesion volume, and older age
at time of testing influenced performance on several attention and EF
measures, whereas sex, lesion location, and stroke laterality did not.
Conclusions: Children with PAIS evidenced significant attention and
EF impairment in comparison to typically developing peers in the
normative population. Children with comorbid epilepsy, larger stroke
volume, and/or older age were at increased risk for deficits in these
domains.

L. BILLINGHURST. Relationship Between Performance Testing
and Parent Report of Attention and Executive Functioning Profiles
in Children Following Perinatal Arterial Ischemic Stroke.
Objective: Children with perinatal arterial ischemic stroke (PAIS) have
higher than expected rates of ADHD, a disorder characterized by weaknesses in attention and executive functioning (EF) skills. Research in
other pediatric disorders has documented a low level of consistency
between parent report of attention and EF skills and performance-based

30
measures. We aimed to compare these two data sources in children
with PAIS.
Participants and Methods: Forty children born at term (≥37 weeks)
ages 3-16 (median age=7.2 years; 58% male) with PAIS underwent
neuropsychological battery and composite scores were created for seven
attention and EF domains (Processing Speed, Attention, Working Memory, Verbal Retrieval, Inhibitory Control, Flexibility/Shifting, Planning). Parents completed questionnaires (ADHD-IV, BRIEF) regarding
real-world functioning. One-way ANOVAs, t-tests, and correlational
analysis were used to compare parent report and performance measures.
Results: There were no significant differences in neuropsychological
composite scores between ADHD-IV severity groups. Correlational analyses between parent report on the Global Executive Composite (GEC)
Index of the BRIEF and the EF composite performance scores revealed
significant negative correlations between the GEC and the Verbal Retrieval and Processing Speed composites but the remaining domains
were nonsignificant.
Conclusions: While children with PAIS broadly have difficulties in
attention and EF on both parent report and performance measures,
few significant relationships were found when these two types of measures were directly compared. Reasons for the dissociation are not fully
understood, but may have several explanations: measures may assess
different aspects of the same underlying construct; performance-based
tasks of EF may lack ecological validity; and parents may underestimate/underreport their child’s deficits. Findings suggest that multiple
sources of informant and performance data are needed to make more
accurate conclusions about functioning in these domains.

First Week Following Sports-Related Concussion.
Objective: Amantadine is a dopaminergic NMDA Receptor Antagonist with possible N-methly-D-aspartate effects and has been studied
to address cognitive symptoms following concussion (Meythaler et al.,
2002; Chew et al., 2009; Tenovuo et al., 2006; & Warden et al., 2009).
Amantadine has shown efficacy as a safe and effective pharmacological treatment for specific cognitive deficits in athletes with protracted
recovery over 3 weeks (Reddy et al., 2013). The purpose of the current
study was to examine the safety and efficacy of Amantadine as pharmacological intervention during the first week of concussion treatment
using a pilot study design.
Participants and Methods: The current study consisted of 20 (10
male, 10 female) adolescent participants divided into two equal groups
based on gender while presenting for clinical evaluation following a
confirmed sport-related concussion diagnosis. Participants ranged from
14-18 years old and were included in the current study if they presented
at least one designated risk factor for potential prolonged recovery with
borderline neurocognitive test performance. 10 athletes (5 male, 5 female) were randomly selected to trial Amantadine in the first week of
recovery and 10 athletes (5 male, 5 female) were not provided any pharmacological intervention to serve as controls. Participants were matched
on age, gender, and number of risk factors for prolonged recovery. All
participants were tracked over time with total days from injury to date
of return to sport, symptoms, and neurocognitive testing serving as an
indicators for recovery.
Results: Participants administered Amantadine recovered an average of
10 days faster than matched controls and were significantly improved
compared to matched controls at initial follow-up on both symptoms
endorsed and neurocognitive test performance.
Conclusions: Results from the current pilot study suggest Amantadine
may have support as a safe and effective pharmacological treatment for
sports-related concussion during the first week of recovery.

E.M. BOUTZOUKAS, M. ZAYAT, G. SMITH, S. YEWALE, M.D. SADY
& G.A. GIOIA. Relationship between School Concussion Policy
and Symptoms, Self-Efficacy, and Supports.
Objective: This study assessed how the presence/absence of a school
concussion policy was related to aspects of recovery. We examined
differences between those whose school did/did not have a policy for
students recovering from a concussion in self-efficacy for managing
concussion recovery, post-concussion concerns, and provision of academic supports.
Participants and Methods: Participants included 59 children (ages
6-18, M (SD) = 13.9 (2.7); 53% male) who were evaluated in a specialty concussion clinic within 35 days of injury. Children and parents
completed the Concussion Learning Assessment and School Survey
(CLASS), Post-Concussion Symptom Inventory (PCSI), and Progressive Activities of Controlled Exertion Self-Efficacy (PACE-SE) scale.
Results: There were no significant differences between groups on symptom totals or number of school days missed (p > .05). “Policy+” parents
and students reported higher self-efficacy related to managing their
concussion at school (parent p = .02, self p = .03). Policy+ parents
reported that academic performance was their primary concern (68%),
while Policy- parents rated concerns with physical symptoms or sports as
primary (57%), with similar findings in students’ self-report (p < .05).
The policy+ group also reported receiving more post-concussion supports (e.g., extended time, reduced work; parent p < .001, self p = .02).
Conclusions: Parents and students who report that their school has a
policy to support students with concussion report similar injury burden
at initial clinic visit (symptoms, amount of school missed), but higher
self-efficacy related to recovery, more school-related concerns, and a
higher number of concussion-related accommodations. While causality
cannot be established, the results suggest that there is a relationship
between having a school-wide policy and feeling confident/supported
in one’s recovery. Future research should investigate whether recovery
time can be positively impacted when students are fully supported in
their return to school following concussion.

G.B. EPSTEIN, M.D. SADY & G.A. GIOIA. Ratings in cognitive
exertion differ across neuropsychological measures following a
concussion.
Objective: To examine whether ratings of cognitive exertion following
concussion differs across varying types of neuropsychological measures. Previous research indicates that taking neuropsychological tests
generally does not increase symptoms in the absence of concussion.
We posited that children with concussion who were administered the
demanding Tasks of Executive Control (TEC) would report greater
cognitive exertion as compared to those who were administered the Immediate Post-Concussion Assessment and Cognitive Testing (ImPACT)/
Multimodal Assessment of Cognition and Symptoms (MACS) or paper
and pencil measures.
Participants and Methods: 66 individuals (22 TEC, 22 ImPACT/
MACS, 22 paper and pencil) who presented at a specialty concussion
clinic (ages 5-18, M=12.53; 61% male) were matched on age, sex, and
days since injury (M=11.29). Children rated symptoms of cognitive
exertion before and after testing using the Cognitive Exertional Effects
Rating Scale (CEERS), with the Exertional Effects Index (EEI) calculated as a metric of increasing symptoms.
Results: Individuals who were administered the TEC reported significantly higher EEIs compared to individuals administered ImPACT/
MACS and paper and pencil measures (d=.69, p=.03 and d=.80, p=.02
respectively). Specifically, significantly greater increases in fatigue

Forty Fourth Annual INS Meeting Abstracts
and concentration problems were noted in subjects who completed the
TEC, and greater increases in irritability were found in the TEC and
ImPACT/MACS groups. No significant differences in headaches were
found across groups.
Conclusions: Ratings of cognitive exertion should be interpreted within
the context of a neuropsychological test, as the TEC tends to produce
greater increases in symptoms following a concussion compared to other
measures. Clinicians may also tailor their choice of assessment based
in part on the symptom level of the individual and whether they would
like to present a cognitive “challenge” to the patient.

A.R. BURNS, M. ZAYAT, D. SRIRAM & G.A. GIOIA. Reliability and
validity of the Progressive Activities of Controlled Exertion- Self
Efficacy (PACE-SE) scale: A novel measure assessing children’s
self-efficacy following a concussion.
Objective: To demonstrate the psychometric properties of a 17-item
measure used to assess a child’s self-efficacy to maintain positive control
during recovery following a concussion.
Participants and Methods: 50 children (ages 10-18) presenting for
an initial visit at a specialty concussion clinic and 37 children returning for a follow-up visit completed the PACE-SE as part of their clinic
evaluation (52% male and 43% male, mean age=14.00 and 14.11,
respectively). A 17–item scale was developed to assess the child’s self-efficacy for coping with and managing their concussion (e.g., ‘I can control
things in my life to allow my brain to heal’ and ‘I can find the right
amount of activity that is not too little and not too much’). Items were
rated on a 0-10 scale, with higher scores indicating greater confidence,
and averaged to create an overall composite score.
Results: Composite scores ranged from 1.88 to 10, with a mean of 7.16
and a standard deviation of 1.69 at the initial visit. At the follow-up
visit, mean ratings ranged from 3.71 to 10 with a mean of 7.55 and
a standard deviation of 1.99. Internal consistency was strong at both
time points (α =.86 & .93, respectively). Test-retest reliability was adequate (r=0.66) and change over time did not differ across gender, age,
days since injury, or prior concussion history. PACE-SE scores were
negatively correlated with symptom burden (r= -0.54 for ages 13-18
and r= -0.69 for ages 10-12) and executive functioning (r= -0.48),
demonstrating high construct validity.
Conclusions: Findings demonstrate adequate reliability and validity
of the PACE-SE, a novel measure designed to assess the self-efficacy
of children recovering from a concussion. The PACE-SE can guide clinicians in the management of concussion by targeting areas of need,
e.g., providing additional supportive education, the need for further
supports with school planning, or possibly the need for a referral to
address difficulty coping with their recovery.

Stroop task Activation in Pediatric Traumatic Brain Injuries (TBI):
an fMRI study.
Objective: The present study reports pilot fMRI data in a Counting
Stroop task pre- and post- attention training in participants with chronic
pediatric traumatic brain injuries (TBI).
Participants and Methods: Children with complicated mild to severe
TBI completed the Attention Improvement and Management (AIM)
program, a 10-week, computerized intervention employing attention
practice drills and strategy training designed to improve attention, working memory, and/or executive functions following pediatric TBI. Eight
participants with TBI (age = 12.5 ± 2.7 years) and ten age-matched,
healthy control children (age = 13.3 + 2.2 years) were scanned with

31
fMRI while performing a Counting Stroop task at baseline and again at
a later session. Children in the TBI group completed the AIM training
between sessions whereas controls received no training.
Results: Accuracy for the participants with TBI generally improved in
the Interference condition from baseline (mean 72%) to time 2 (86%),
and numerically more so than healthy controls (from 84% to 89%).
Brain activation showed predominantly a modest decrease for participants with TBI as well as for healthy controls. One cluster in the medial frontal area (BA8) showed a larger decrease from time1 to time2
in participants with TBI than that seen in healthy controls (p=0.005
uncorrected, cluster=20).
Conclusions: Higher level of activity in BA8 has been reported in pediatric TBI relative to healthy controls. The preliminary results in the
present study suggest that the AIM training may play a normalizing role
in the course of recovery.

C. CHEUNG & G.A. GIOIA. The Association between Change in
Post-Concussion Symptoms and Self-Efficacy over Recovery from
Concussion.
Objective: Examine the relations between parent and child report of
changes in perceived self-efficacy (SE) and post-concussion symptoms
in a sample of youth with concussion.
Participants and Methods: 29 youth (ages 12-18; 69% female) and
44 parents of youths (ages 6-18) with concussions were evaluated twice
(min-max days since injury=10-72, M=29, SD=13) at a specialty concussion clinic. The Progressive Activities of Controlled Exertion (PACE)
intervention model was used to educate patients and guide recovery.
Parents and youth rated their confidence on a 0 to 10 scale in performing pro-recovery activities on the PACE-SE measure (17-item Child,
19-item Parent surveys). Symptoms were assessed using parent and
age-specific self-report forms of the Post-Concussion Symptom Inventory (PCSI), adjusted for pre-injury symptomatology. Differences in
self-efficacy were examined, along with the correlations between change
in symptoms and change in self-efficacy ratings across two visits.
Results: Seventy-five percent of youth reported increased SE from V1
to V2 (mean=14 ±23). In contrast, 60% of parents reported decreased
SE from V1 to V2 (mean= -3 ± 17). However, parent’s PACE-SE scores
were near the ceiling of the measure (mean of 170 score, with max
score=190). For youth, increased SE was associated with reduced symptoms over time (r=-.36; p<.05). Similarly, parent SE was negatively
associated with parent reported post-concussion symptoms (r=-.37;
p<.05). There were no significant associations between age, gender,
time since injury, or injury-related characteristics (LOC, amnesia, injury
type) with changes in PACE-SE.
Conclusions: Parents and youth who reported a greater increase in
self-efficacy following treatment for concussion reported a greater reduction in post-concussion symptoms. Findings highlight the potential
of the PACE model for increasing self-efficacy in order to manage symptoms and promote recovery following concussion.

Patterns of Performance on Neuropsychological Assessment in
Pediatric TBI and Control Samples.
Objective: Assessment of traumatic brain injury (TBI) to the developing
brain continues to reveal lasting effects. Additional research continues
to inform patterns of performance.
Participants and Methods: TBI participants were recruited from
Loma Linda University Children’s Hospital Level-1 Trauma Center’s
emergency department. Non-head injured controls were recruited from

32
pediatric routine appointments with same exclusion criteria. 85 moderate/severe pediatric TBI patients ages 6-16 (50.6% female, M age
Time 1=12.03, SD=3.42; M age Time 2=13.21, SD=3.34) completed
Children’s Memory Scale, Test of Everyday Attention-Children, and
Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence at 3-months and 12-months
post injury. Results were compared to age-matched healthy controls (n
=85) assessed nine months apart.
Results: Paired sample t-tests were utilized to examine group trends
between two time points on measures of IQ, memory and attention.
Results revealed significant differences between time points in all areas: FSIQ; t(68)=2.76, p=.007), General Memory; t(58)=6.05,p=.000)
and Attention; t(59)=2.35, p=.022). Visual Immediate/Delayed Memory and General Memory showed the strongest recovery from 3 to 12
months in TBI patients. Compared to controls, the TBI sample at the
12-month assessment continued to fall below control scores at their
initial assessment.
Conclusions: Similar patterns of improved scores were found among
control and TBI samples. Initial scores that were higher were more likely
to show a stronger improvement at Time 2, with control’s performance
being better across all measures. Those who performed very poorly were
less likely to show larger gains at Time 2. Visual Immediate/Delayed and
General Memory showed the largest gains. This study reinforces existing
literature suggesting children whose initial scores are poor demonstrate
less recovery over time.

G.B. EPSTEIN, D. RANSOM, M.D. SADY, C.E. LATHAN &
G.A. GIOIA. Concussion-Related Cognitive Exertion Ratings in
Uninjured High School Athletes.
Objective: Tracking cognitive exertion effects is vital to assess and
treat pediatric concussions. Previous research has established base rates
of exertion change following ImPACT. We examined how symptoms
changed in response to other forms of cognitive exertion, such as another
neurocognitive assessment and a day of school, and across multiple
administrations.
Participants and Methods: Twenty-seven high school athletes (52%
male; 14-18 years) were administered the Defense Automated Neurobehavioral Assessment (DANA), a 20-minute computer-based cognitive test battery that measures memory, attention, and response speed,
eight times - twice per day for four days over a month. Adolescents
completed the Exertional Effects Rating Scale (EERS) before and after
each DANA administration to measure change in individual symptoms
(i.e., headaches, fatigue, concentration difficulty, and irritability) on a
0-10 Guttman scale.
Results: Following DANA testing, participants’ fatigue (mean change
= 0.50; p < .05, d = 0.52), concentration difficulty (0.61; p < .01, d =
0.69), and sum exertion ratings increased (1.59; p < .001, d = 0.77).
However, exertion rating change following DANA testing was not impacted by the time of day of administration (i.e., morning or afternoon;
mean change difference = 0.15; p = .70, d = 0.07), and no systematic
changes in ratings over time were noted (p = .53, η2= 0.02). Exertion
ratings did not significantly change from morning to afternoon over the
course of a school day (-0.02 p = .98, d = 0.01).
Conclusions: Although participants’ exertion ratings increased after
DANA testing, increases were small in magnitude and below the clinical threshold for pediatric concussions, previously determined to be a
change greater than three. There were no systematic effects of the timing
of DANA administration on exertional effects, suggesting the EERS is a
reliable tool and has utility in multiple settings. Further, participants’
symptoms were relatively stable and uninfluenced by the demands of
a typical school day.

C. GHILAIN, K.E. ONO & T.G. BURNS. Pediatric ImPACT: Detecting
Age and Gender Based Differences of Baseline Functioning.
Objective: Pediatric Immediate Post-Concussive Assessment and Cognitive Testing (ImPACT) is a computer-based assessment measuring
neurocognitive functioning in children with suspected concussion. Using
colorful graphics similar to those in video games, Pediatric ImPACT
can be administered in 10-15 minutes and assesses sequencing/attention, word memory, visual memory and reaction time. Previous studies
have demonstrated that age and gender significantly impact neuropsychological performance on the ImPACT used in adolescent and adult
populations. Therefore, this serves as a description of age and gender
differences at baseline assessment in a pediatric sample.
Participants and Methods: 358 children between 5-11 years (M=
107.26 months, SD= 19.93 months), who were identified as participants in high impact sports, completed baseline assessments from the
Pediatric ImPACT battery.
Results: One Way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) were conducted to
assess age differences in neurocognitive performance. Significant differences were found by age on Word List Immediate (WLI) F(6,351)=
30.26, p<.01 and Delayed (WLD) F(6,351)= 36.08, p<.01 Recall,
Memory Touch Number Correct (MTNC) F(6,351)= 99.82, p<.01, Stop
and Go Number Correct (SGNC) F(6, 351)= 9.55, p<.01, and Picture
Memory Average Taps F(6,351)= 195.27, p<.01 and Completion Time
(PMCT) F(6,351)= 865.68, p<.01. Results of gender analyses demonstrated significant differences in performance on WLI F(1,356)=17.67,
p=<.01 and WLD F(1,356)=5.83,p=.02, MTNC F(1,356)=14.40,p<.01,
SGNC (1,356)=3.91,p<.05, and PMCT F(1,356)=5.58,p=.02.
Conclusions: Results, as expected, suggest significant age and gender-based differences in neurocognitive performance on the Pediatric
ImPACT. These results highlight the importance of age and gender
normative data as tools to facilitate appropriate return to play or
school recommendations for those children without individual baseline
assessments.

Callosum Integrity in Children with Mild Traumatic Brain Injury
(mTBI).
Objective: mTBI represents a major public health concern for youth
under 15 years of age. Although mTBI can result in persistent functional
impairments, standard brain imaging protocols are typically negative.
This discrepancy poses a dilemma for clinicians. The corpus callosum
(CC) is thought particularly vulnerable in neurotrauma and therefore
a candidate to assesses the predictive utility of diffusion tensor imaging
(DTI) tractography in mTBI outcome. Although CC pathology is well
documented in patients with moderate and severe TBI, it remains unknown (1) to what extent the CC is susceptible to damage in mTBI and
(2) whether or not tract profiles are useful to evaluate associations of
white matter integrity with functional outcomes.
Participants and Methods: Participants were children aged 8-15 years
with mTBI or mild orthopedic injuries (OI). DTI scans were obtained
within 10 days of injury. Using Automated Fiber-tract Quantification,
the CC was reconstructed in each child’s native space and segmented
into 8 sections: orbital, anterior, superior frontal; motor; superior, posterior parietal; occipital; temporal. Diffusion measures were extracted
along 100 segments of each section to provide tract profiles. Diffusion
measures were correlated with Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence® - Second Edition Full Scale IQ.
Results: CC integrity was reduced in mTBI children compared to OI.
Tract profiles revealed lower fractional anisotropy and higher radial
diffusivity at various points along each of the CC segmented tracts, with
some differences significant after false discovery rate correction. These
findings related to IQ measures in mTBI but not OI children.

Forty Fourth Annual INS Meeting Abstracts
Conclusions: CC integrity in the sub-acute phase is reduced in mTBI
children. DTI of the CC may serve as a biomarker and predict mTBI outcome. Using tract profiles rather than overall mean measures of the tract
appears more sensitive for detecting subtle changes following mTBI.

Self-Report of Symptoms in Sports-Related Concussions.
Objective: Self-reported postconcussive symptoms (PCS) were examined in student-athletes recovering from a sports-related concussion.
Current emphasis is on restricting physical/cognitive exertion until the
athlete is asymptomatic, as resuming activities too soon can exacerbate
PCS. However, many athletes have difficulty adjusting if this lasts an
extended time. Concussion management should strive to balance these
considerations. A better understanding of the PCS that concern student-athletes may provide information to guide these considerations.
Participants and Methods: Participants were 132 children/adolescents, (10-18 years old, M=14.6), who were referred to a Concussion
Clinic in a Midwestern medical center. Participants were 61.1% male
(n=81) and 38.9% female (n=51).
Data were obtained from a de-identified dataset. A licensed neurologist
examined participants; this included acute (time of injury) and current
(time of evaluation) PCS. Current PCS were divided into four domains
(cognitive, physical, emotional/behavioral, sleep).
Results: On average, 5.1 symptoms were reported. More physical PCS
were reported compared to the other domains. Number of acute PCS
significantly correlated with total and cognitive PCS (r=.2 p<.05, r=.24,
p<.01). T-tests indicated that girls reported significantly more total
(t=-2.59, p<.01), cognitive (t=-2.33, p<.05), and emotional/behavioral
PCS (t=-2.01, p<.05) when compared with boys.
Bivariate correlations and one-way analyses of variance were examined
to determine if any demographic or injury-related variables (ethnicity,
age, premorbid diagnosis, number of days since injury, number of prior
concussions) were related to the PCS domains. Prior concussions and
age were each significantly correlated with cognitive PCS (r=.26, p<.01,
r=.25, p<.01).
Conclusions: These results indicate that student-athletes are primarily
concerned with physical PCS. Female gender, age, and number of prior
concussions contribute to the recovery process.

M. STEINLIN & K. LEIBUNDGUT. The Influence of Age at
Diagnosis for Cognitive Performance in Pediatric Brain Tumor
Patients Before Treatment.
Objective: Survivors of brain tumors (BT) have a high risk for a wide
range of cognitive problems. These dysfunctions are caused by the lesion
itself and its surgical removal, as well as subsequent treatments (chemoand/or radiation therapy). In a recent study we found patients with
BTs performed significantly worse in tests of working memory, verbal
memory and attention compared to children with cancer without central
nervous system involvement (CNS-) at diagnosis, i.e. before the start of
any medical treatment (Margelisch et al., 2015). The aim of the present
study was to investigate the influence of age at diagnosis on differences
in neuropsychological profiles in children with BT and children with an
oncological diagnosis not involving the CNS.
Participants and Methods: Thirty-two children with BT and 40
children with an oncological disease without involvement of the CNS
were divided into two age-groups (young age: 6-9 yrs (BT n=17; CNS-:
n=19); older 13-16 yrs). All children were evaluated with an extensive battery of neuropsychological tests. Patients were administered

33
before any therapeutic intervention such as surgery, chemotherapy or
irradiation.
Results: Young children with brain tumors performed worse compared
to older children with brain tumors in measures of attention and memory. This age difference is not found in the oncological comparison group
without CNS involvement. When compared to age-matched young children with cancer without CNS involvement (CNS-), young children with
BT show a significantly worse performance in measures of attention,
verbal memory and working memory while other cognitive functions
are at a comparable level.
Conclusions: Young age at diagnosis of a brain tumor negatively influences cognitive performance of these children even before the start
of medical treatment. This patient group needs to be closely monitored
to start cognitive interventions as early as possible.

Validating Neurocognitive Measures in an Adolescent Sports
Concussion Sample: ImPACT Computerized Testing versus
Traditional Neuropsychological Measures.
Objective: Documented incidence rates of sport-related concussions
have increased in recent years. Concern regarding potential cognitive
consequences has driven researchers, clinicians, and medical personnel
to seek suitable measures to detect thinking difficulties post-concussion.
As computerized measures are introduced to achieve baseline measurements and to track cognitive changes, the need to determine comparability between computerized and non-computerized measures has arisen.
Participants and Methods: Twenty-nine athletes (Mage = 14.41, SD
= 1.32) experiencing persistent concussion symptoms were compared
to 25 healthy athlete controls (Mage = 14.08, SD = 1.32). Participants
were given neuropsychological screenings, including ImPACT and several traditional paper and pencil measures. Groups were matched for
ethnicity, and no significant differences were found in age (F = .86, p =
.36), sex (χ2 = .39,p = .53), or education (F = .22, p = .64).
Results: Differences between groups were examined using one-way
ANOVAs. Significant differences were found between groups on four
ImPACT domains (Verbal Memory F = 13.11, p = .00; Visual Memory F
= 15.54, p = .00; Visuomotor Speed F = 16.91, p = .00; Reaction Time
F = 23.92, p = .00) and in six paper and pencil measures: CMS Dots
Delay (delayed visual memory; F = 6.38, p = .02), Trails Making Test
B (complex visuomotor speed with executive components; F 12.74=,
p = .00), D-KEFS Design Fluency (executive functions; F =17.36, p
= .00), phonemic fluency (expressive language; F = 9.21, p = .00),
animals semantic fluency (expressive language; F = 7.43, p = .01), and
Beery Visuomotor Index (visuomotor construction; F =37.78, p = .00).
Conclusions: These findings suggest ImPACT may effectively detect
prolonged cognitive symptoms following concussion. When compared to
paper-and-pencil measures, convergent scores in most domains suggest
some comparability between this computerized measure and non-computerized measures.

(CBCL). Regression analyses were conducted to determine the relationships between ANT scores, injury factors (injury group, age of injury),
and demographic variables (age, sex, and socioeconomic status).
Results: Parent report measures revealed increased attention problems
in children with early TBI (mean T = 59.40, S.D. = 9.89) as compared to OI (OI mean T = 53.65, SD = 5.93; p<.001). However, the
TBI groups did not differ from OI in performance on ANT network
scores (alerting, orienting, or executive). Injury group (p=.035) and
SES (p=.003) significantly predicted mean reaction time on the ANT.
There was also a significant interaction between group and age of injury;
in the TBI group, earlier injuries were associated with slower reaction
times (p=.035).
Conclusions: Although children with TBI show increased attention
problems in the day to day environment, the current study does not
provide evidence implicating the disruption of specific attention networks. Additional research is needed to further understand the neural
mechanisms underlying attention and executive dysfunction in children
with TBI.

E.C. MAXWELL, R.L. PETERSON, M. KIRKWOOD, H.G. TAYLOR,
T. STANCIN, T. BROWN & S.L. WADE. Impact of CounselorAssisted Problem Solving on Parental Coping in Families of
Children with Traumatic Brain Injury.
Objective: The present study evaluated the impact of the Counselor-Assisted Problem Solving (CAPS) program on parental coping, compared
to an Internet resource comparison (IRC) group. Families in the CAPS
program were hypothesized to exhibit improved parental coping skills
over time (baseline to 18 months post-injury), whereas the families in
the IRC condition would exhibit stable parental coping over time.
Participants and Methods: Participants were children (ages 12 to 17
years) hospitalized during the 6 months prior to the study for moderate
to severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) and their parent(s). Participants
in CAPS (n = 41) completed 8 to 12 online modules (training in problem
solving, communication skills, and self-regulation) and videoconferencing with a therapist. Participants in the IRC group (n = 49) received
links to Internet resources about pediatric TBI. Parents were asked
to complete the COPE at baseline and 18 months post-injury. Analyses were evaluated utilizing repeated measures analysis of variance
(ANOVA).
Results: There was a significant effect for time for eight of the fifteen
COPE subscales (p < 0.05), such that both groups had higher ratings
at baseline compared to 18 months post-injury. For the Use of Instrumental Support subscale, there was a significant interaction between
group and time F(1, 88) = 5.87, p = 0.02, such that the ratings increased
for the CAPS group and decreased for the IRC group. For the Humor
subscale, there was a significant interaction between group and time
F(1, 88) = 4.22, p = 0.04, such that both groups had lower ratings over
time, with a greater decrease for the IRC group.
Conclusions: The present study found that families in the CAPS condition had increased levels of instrumental support use over time and
maintained higher levels of humor compared to the IRC condition. Thus,
the current findings suggest that the CAPS program can partially help
to improve parental coping.

K. VANNATTA & K.O. YEATES. Frontal Volumetrics and Social
Functioning in Children following Traumatic Brain Injury.
Objective: Research on the role of the frontal lobes in social behavior
has traditionally differentiated between traditional anatomic regions
(TAR): superior and inferior-medial, orbital, and dorsolateral frontal
cortical regions. This approach has been an important source for much
of the current theory in neuropsychology related to frontal lobe function.
While FreeSurfer (FS) methods permit examination of gyral volume
derived from Brodmann’s areas, these regions of interest (ROIs) do not
necessarily conform to the TAR frontal classification. The current study
used operator-controlled volumetric analysis of TAR ROIs compared
to FS ROIs to examine social functioning in pediatric traumatic brain
injury (TBI).
Participants and Methods: Participants were 58 children with complicated mild to severe TBI (age=7.80±1.88 years; 36% female; GCS
= 10.67±5.04) and 47 OI controls (age=7.82±1.83; 36% female) who
were recruited as part of the SOBIK study. T1-weighted imaging at 1.5
Tesla was acquired on average 2.61 years post injury. The frontal lobes
were partitioned into four TAR ROIs in each hemisphere according to
the method established by Wilde et al. (2005), as well as eight gyral FS
volumes in each hemisphere. Correlational analyses were undertaken
between TAR volumes and FS across the entire sample. Correlations
were also conducted between frontal volumes and the Social Composite
on the ABAS-II across the entire sample.
Results: Positive correlations were observed between FS and TAR volumes (r~ 0.06 to r~0.51, p<0.001). The TAR method revealed that
the orbitofrontal regions were significantly correlated with the Social
Composite on the ABAS-II (r~0.19 to r~0.29, p<0.01). These findings
were not replicated using FS methods.
Conclusions: The TAR method has the advantage of using a traditional approach of differentiating frontal lobe cortical areas and, as
shown herein, orbitofrontal TAR volume related to social outcome in
pediatric TBI.

K.A. MONAHAN, K.R. WOLFE, D. BODIN, J. CASS, M. GOLDMAN,
J. LUNDINE & K. MCNALLY. Feasibility and Acceptability of
a Brain Injury Education Program on a Pediatric Inpatient
Rehabilitation Unit.
Objective: This pilot study examined the feasibility and acceptability
of a semi-structured traumatic brain injury (TBI) education program
for caregivers on a pediatric rehabilitation unit.
Participants and Methods: Participants included primary caregivers
of 13 children with moderate to severe TBI admitted for inpatient rehabilitation. This program consisted of 5 educational modules covered
in individual sessions and included written handouts (TBI Overview,
Self-Care for Caregivers, Behavior/Emotional/Social Sequelae, Cognitive Sequelae, and Safety/Supervision). Caregivers completed pre and
post-assessments of TBI knowledge and ratings of comfort level with
discharge. Satisfaction ratings were also collected.
Results: On average, this program involved 1.73 hours of face-to-face
time with each family (range = .75 – 2.75 hours). There were no significant differences between caregivers’ pre and post-test of TBI knowledge.
However, caregivers reported feeling significantly more comfortable going home with their child on the post-test relative to the pre-test, t(10) =
-2.66, p < .05. They also reported that they had a significantly greater
understanding of their child’s brain injury, including recovery and risk
factors, t(10) = -9.8, p < .01. All caregivers reported the highest possible
rating of satisfaction and helpfulness of the program. Twelve caregivers
reported the highest possible rating of helpfulness of handouts provided
during the program; one reported the second highest rating.
Conclusions: Implementation of a semi-structured TBI education program on a pediatric inpatient rehabilitation unit was well-accepted by

Forty Fourth Annual INS Meeting Abstracts
families, and they reported finding the information provided helpful.
In addition, initial data suggest caregivers felt more comfortable being
discharged with their child with a TBI after completing a formal education program. These pilot data suggest this is a promising program
to be further developed and researched in a more controlled fashion.

V. PLOURDE & B. BROOKS. ADHD symptoms predict quality
of life following pediatric moderate-to-severe traumatic brain
injury.
Objective: Increasing scientific evidence suggests that youth who sustained a moderate-to-severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) are at higher
risk of presenting inattention and hyperactivity symptoms and an affected quality of life. Although worse ADHD symptoms are associated
with poorer quality of life in population-based and ADHD populations,
less is known about these associations in children and adolescents with
TBI. The objective is to look at whether ADHD symptoms predict quality
of life in youth with TBI.
Participants and Methods: Participants (N = 88, 52 girls and 36 boys,
mean age=12.79, SD=4.19, majority English speakers and Caucasian)
with a moderate-to-severe TBI were recruited through a tertiary care
hospital. Mean age of injury was 10.41 (SD=5.48, range=infant-18
years) and mean time between injury and assessment was 2.38 years
(SD=3.60, range=8 days to 17 years). Measures included the ADHD
Rating Scale-IV (parent reports) and the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL – children and parent reports).
Results: More inattention symptoms uniquely predicted lower school
functioning as reported by parents and children. Conversely, more
hyperactivity symptoms uniquely predicted lower family functioning
(parent-reported) on many scales: family health-related (emotional,
social, and physical) quality of life; family functioning; and worries.
There were not sex differences on ADHD and PedsQL scores; there were
also no differences on PedsQL scores between children with or without
severe ADHD symptoms except for parent-reported school functioning.
Conclusions: The study suggests that ADHD symptoms impact
health-related quality of life in youth with moderate-to-severe TBI.
Worse inattention symptoms affect children’s academic life while worse
hyperactivity symptoms affect family’s quality of life, underlying the
importance of assessing and treating both types of symptoms and their
potential differential effects on health-related quality of life.

Subconcussive Related Changes in High School Football Player
Reaction Time.
Objective: The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship
between player head impact exposure and seasonal changes in cognition
and symptom status using the Immediate Post-Concussive Assessment
and Cognitive Test (ImPACT) and the Post-Concussion Symptom Scale
(PCSS) in the absence of concussion.
Participants and Methods: Subconcussive impacts were recorded using the Head Impact Telemetry System and quantified as a cumulative
risk weighted estimate (RWECP) of head impact exposure. 22 male
subjects (Avg age: 16.96; SD: 0.67) were evaluated for seasonal changes
on ImPACT and Post-Concussion Symptom Scale (PCSS) composite
scores; all subjects included had complete data and did not receive
a clinically diagnosable concussion. Pre/Post-season composite scores
were compared via repeated measures MANOVA. The relationship between change in composite scores (post score – pre score) and RWECP
was investigated via Pearson Correlation Coefficient.
Results: Repeated measures MANOVA revealed no differences between
pre- and post-season composite scores . A significant relationship was

35
found between RWECP and seasonal change in the ImPACT composite score of Reaction Time (Delta RT)(r=0.49, p=0.0208). No other
seasonal change in ImPACT score was related to RWECP. Seasonal
change in PCSS Total Symptom Score (Delta PCSS) was not significantly related to RWECP.
Conclusions: While no change was found in cognitive performance
from the beginning to the end of the season, a significant relationship
was found between cumulative impact exposure and change in reaction
time, despite no concussion. The meaning of this relationship is unclear,
and requires further exploration with a larger sample size, particularly
in light of no significant change in post-season symptom report.

N. SANDEL, P. SCHATZ, K. GOLDBERG & M. LAZAR. Deficits in
Memory and Processing Speed following Acute Sports Concussion.
Objective: To identify gender differences in high school male and female
lacrosse players’ neurocognitive performance following acute sports-related concussion.
Participants and Methods: High school lacrosse players (112 males,
112 females) were matched to a control group of soccer players based
on age and gender, resulting in a total sample of 448 athletes aged 13
to 17 years old (M=15.43, SD=1.09). Soccer players were included to
control for differences in male and female versions of lacrosse. Athletes
underwent baseline and post-concussion computerized-neurocognitive
testing within 3 days of injury using the Immediate Post-Concussion
Assessment and Cognitive Testing (ImPACT). Memory and Speed factors (Schatz & Maerlender, 2014) were calculated from ImPACT composite scores and served as dependent variables in analyses. Data were
analyzed at baseline and post-injury using a mixed-factorial MANOVA
with gender and sport as between-subjects factors; significant effects
were further explored with univariate analyses.
Results: Athletes demonstrated a significantly worse performance
post-injury, F(2,219)=9.81, p<.001, on both Memory, F=18.0,
p<.000, and Speed, F=4.85, p=.03, factors. Gender had a significant
main effect, F(2,219)=9.18, p<.001, and interaction effect with time,
F(2,219)=6.50, p=.002, on cognitive performance. Univariate analyses
indicated that females’ Memory performance worsened significantly after concussion compared to males, F=13.03, p<.000. No main effect was
found for sport type, F(2,219)=2.39, p=.09, but a significant interaction
effect was found between sport and time, F(2,219)=3.36, p=.04. Soccer
players demonstrated a steeper decline in Memory compared to lacrosse
players after concussion, F=6.67, p=.01.
Conclusions: Athletes performed worse on neurocognitive measures
of memory and processing speed after concussion. Females and soccer
players demonstrated a steeper decline in memory after concussion relative to males and lacrosse players, respectively.

A. TREBLE-BARNA, N. ZHANG, A. CASSEDY, H. TAYLOR,
K.O. YEATES & S.L. WADE. Profile Analysis of Long-Term
Neuropsychological Functioning following Traumatic Brain
Injury in Early Childhood.
Objective: To conduct a profile analysis of long-term neuropsychological functioning in children who sustained early traumatic brain injury
(TBI) as compared to children who sustained orthopedic injury (OI).
Participants and Methods: Participants included children who sustained moderate (n = 42) and severe (n = 16) TBI or orthopedic injuries
(OI; n = 72) between ages 3-7 years. A battery of neuropsychological tests examining verbal reasoning, nonverbal reasoning, processing
speed, verbal fluency, attentional control, response inhibition, sustained
attention, planning skills, and pragmatic judgment were administered at
6.8 (±1.1) years post-injury. Repeated-measures ANCOVA, controlling
for SES and time since injury, with test scores as the dependent variables

36
and group as the independent variable was used to conduct a profile
analysis.
Results: Analyses revealed a trend for the interaction of test by group
(p = .072), suggesting that the shape of the profiles differed by group.
Simple main effects of group for each test revealed significantly poorer
nonverbal intelligence, processing speed, and response inhibition in the
severe TBI group relative to both the moderate TBI and OI groups;
remaining test scores were comparable across groups.
Conclusions: Children sustaining TBI during early childhood continue
to show poorer neuropsychological profiles many years post-injury. The
primary differences in cognitive profiles between children with severe
TBI and children with moderate TBI or OI appears to be in nonverbal
reasoning, processing speed, and response inhibition.

G. VARGAS, H. SCHOFIELD & J. CROWLEY. Child Versus Parent
Reported Recovery Post-concussion: Differences and Correlates.
Objective: Self report of symptoms from children can be less reliable
based on limits of insight, memory, and other factors. However, parents
can have limited knowledge of the child’s symptoms (e.g., headache,
mental fogginess). With the continued focus on symptom report as a
measurement of concussion severity and recovery, it is important to find
reliable and valid measurements of symptoms in children.
Participants and Methods: Participants were a consecutive cohort
presenting to a multidisciplinary Concussion Clinic during one calendar
year. The Post-Concussion scale (PCS) was given before the visit and
reviewed during interview. Parent and child were also asked to rate how
close to 100% (baseline functioning) the child was at time of visit. The
ImPACT was also administered. Participants (N=148) ranged from 10
to 18 years old and 43% were female. Forty-nine percent of concussions
were sports-related and 29% of children had a pre-existing exceptionality (e.g., ADHD). Patients were seen on average 5 weeks post-injury
(range =1-18 weeks).
Results: Self ratings were significantly higher than parent ratings
(t(147)=3.0,p<.01) across the whole sample. However, for children seen
within 1 month from injury, self and parent ratings did not significantly
differ. For children seen further than 1 month from injury, self and parent ratings differed significantly (t(65)=2.5,p<.05). PCS total was correlated with all ImPACT composite scores (r=-.2—.4,p<.001-.01). Self
ratings were correlated with 3 out of 4 ImPACT scores (r=.2-.3,p<.01).
Parent rating was only related to 1 score (r=.2,p<.01).
Conclusions: Significant differences were found between parent and
child ratings of symptom recovery, particularly when assessed further
from injury. Child ratings of recovery were more related to cognitive
testing results. This, supports the need to obtain symptom reports from
both the child and parent. A percent recovery rating is a fast way to
incorporate this input from children.

C.G. VAUGHAN, G.A. GIOIA & P.K. ISQUITH. Examining a 3
Subtest Format of the Tasks of Executive Control (TEC) in a
Concussed and Non-concussed Sample.
Objective: The Tasks of Executive Control (TEC) measures the effect
of increasing working memory and inhibitory control on accuracy and
response speed performance over six tasks. We examined whether a
subset of TEC tasks could serve as an abbreviated measure.
Participants and Methods: Typically developing children (n=237) and
children with recent concussions (n=89) aged 8-18 years were selected
from the TEC normative and clinical datasets (mean age = 12.62 ± 2.5;
67% male). Regression analysis examined the strength of association

between subtest scores on three tasks in the inhibit condition (0-back,
1-back, & 2-back) with the full 6 subtest Summary Scores. Effect sizes
for the full and abbreviated TEC were compared for a subsample of 68
children (mean age = 13.41 ± 2.5; 84% male) with concussions seen
within 32 days of injury (mean days to visit = 6.89 ± 5.0) and agematched healthy controls (93% male).
Results: The 3-subtest task scores were strongly correlated with the full
6-subtest Summary Scores (r= .959-.991, p <.0001). Concussed children had significantly different (p<.05) scores than matched controls
for accuracy, response time and variability on both full and abbreviated
measures. Overall, effect sizes were similar, ranging from 6 subtest d =
.85 vs. 3 subtest d = .76 for variability to 6 subtest d = .48 vs 3 subtest
d = .44 for accuracy.
Conclusions: TEC scores derived from an abbreviated 3-subtest measure account for considerable variance in scores from the full 6-subtest
battery. Differences between concussed and non-concussed children are
equally evident in both versions. The abbreviated test may be a viable
way to assess working memory and inhibitory control while reducing
test taker burden via an abbreviated battery.

Relation of DTI with Reading and Language Skills in Pediatric TBI.
Objective: Reading and other academic skills may be adversely affected
by traumatic brain injury (TBI) in children; however, the neural underpinnings of this relationship have not been thoroughly investigated.
Participants and Methods: Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) was
performed in children who sustained complicated-mild to severe TBI
(n=40; mean age=15.4 years) and a group of orthopedically-injured
(OI) children (n=25). Fractional anisotropy (FA) and apparent diffusion
coefficient (ADC) assessed white matter integrity in frontal, corpus callosum (CC), and inferior fronto-occipital fasciculi (IFOF) at 12 months
post-injury. We examined relations between DTI metrics and performance on measures of reading (GORT-4) and language (CELF-4).
Results: Groups did not differ in SES, race, sex and handedness. The
TBI group demonstrated decreased white matter integrity in all regions
(i.e., decreased FA/increased ADC, p<0.01). Groups did not differ on
GORT-4 index scaled or CELF-4 formulated sentence scores, though
age at injury contributed to performance on GORT-4 comprehension
and CELF-4 formulated sentence scores, with younger age associated
with worse performance. In the OI group, GORT-4 fluency was negatively correlated with FA in the right frontal (p<0.05), CC (p=0.05)
and right IFOF (p=0.07). Reading rate was associated with right frontal
(p<0.05), CC (p=0.08) and right IFOF (p=0.09) FA. In the TBI group,
GORT-4 rate, fluency and comprehension were not correlated with FA,
though GORT-4 accuracy correlated with right frontal FA (p=0.05).
Conclusions: Our results support the contribution of age at injury to
brain integrity and basic reading skills post-TBI. Contrary to expectation, DTI was largely unrelated to reading or language skills in the TBI
group and only weakly related in the OI group. Reading skills may have
become crystalized in these children by the time of injury, and a more
complex measure of abstract reading skills may be necessary to reveal
underlying brain-behavior relations.

M. WOJTOWICZ, M. HERCEG & G.L. IVERSON. Comparing
Baseline Concussion Measures in High School Student Athletes.
Objective: Some high schools and colleges administer several standardized tests prior to an athletic season as part of their concussion
management program. The purpose of this study was to examine the

Forty Fourth Annual INS Meeting Abstracts
relations between performance on sideline and computerized baseline
tests (i.e., King-Devick (K-D) Test; Sideline Assessment of Concussion,
SAC; and ImPACT®) in high school athletes.
Participants and Methods: A total of 143 high school athletes [Age
M (SD)=15.4 (1.2); Boys=78, 54.5%] completed baseline pre-season
testing with ImPACT®, K-D, and SAC. ImPACT® was administered in
a group setting in a computer lab. The K-D and SAC were administered
individually on the following day.
Results: There were no differences in performance between boys and
girls on any of the measures (p>.05). Age was negatively correlated with
total symptoms (r=-.20; p<.05) and positively correlated with Visual
Motor Speed scores (r=.34; p<.001). K-D Scores were negatively correlated with SAC (r=-.17; p<.05) and Visual Motor Speed scores (r=.31; p<.05). SAC scores were positively correlated with Verbal Memory
(r=.29; p<.001), Visual Memory (r=.24; p<.001), and Visual Motor
Speed composite scores (r=.29; p<.001). Athletes were divided into
normal SAC (i.e., total scores of ≥25; n=109) and low SAC (i.e., total
scores of ≤24; n=34) subgroups. Those who performed more poorly
on the SAC also had lower scores on the ImPACT® Verbal Memory
(p<.001, d=0.74), Visual Memory (p=.004, d=0.56), and Reaction Time
(p=.04, d=.53) composites, but not on the Visual Motor Speed (p=.10,
d=0.42) composite.
Conclusions: In high school athletes, baseline scores on the King-Devick Test were significantly correlated with reaction time and processing speed measures from ImPACT®. Poor performance on the SAC
was associated with worse performance on most ImPACT® composite
scores. These data suggest that there is only modest concordance between pre-season baseline measures.

M. WOJTOWICZ, M. HERCEG & G.L. IVERSON. Pre-season
Concussion Testing in High School Students with Academic
Difficulties or Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder.
Objective: Learning disabilities and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are considered to be important risk factors or modifiers
for concussion assessment and management. The purpose of this study
was to examine cognition and symptom reporting in high school students
with academic difficulties or ADHD.
Participants and Methods: A sample of 143 high school students [Age
M (SD)=15.4 (1.2); Boys=78, 54.5%] completed baseline pre-season
testing with ImPACT®, the King-Devick test, and the Sideline Assessment of Concussion (SAC). ImPACT® was administered in a group
setting in a computer lab. The King-Devick test and SAC were administered individually on the following day. Students were identified as
having academic difficulties (i.e., received special education, repeated
a grade, or a diagnosed learning disability) or ADHD based on their
self report.
Results: Non-parametric tests were used because of violations of normality. High school students with academic difficulties or ADHD (n=21)
were compared to controls (n=122) on the King-Devick test, SAC, ImPACT® Cognitive Composite scores, and Total Symptom ratings. Students with academic difficulties or ADHD performed significantly more
poorly on the King-Devick test (p=.003; d=.79), the Visual Motor Speed
Composite of ImPACT® (p=0.007; d=.79), and they reported more
symptoms at baseline on the Post-Concussion Scale (p=.005; d=.59).
There were no significant differences between groups on SAC scores
(p=.11; d=.36) or ImPACT® Verbal Memory (p=.54; d=0.16), Visual
Memory (p=.20; d=0.26), or Reaction Time (p=.14; d=.55) Composite
scores.
Conclusions: To our knowledge this is the first study to examine performance on three different pre-season baseline measures in high school
students with academic difficulties or ADHD. High school students with
academic difficulties or ADHD performed more poorly on the King-Devick test, the Visual Motor Speed Composite of ImPACT®, and they
reported more symptoms at baseline.

A.M. CHAMBERS, D. GARCIA, M.D. UDHNANI, C.E. TYNER &
S.C. HEATON. Problems with Executive Planning are Associated
with Social Withdrawal in Adolescent Traumatic Brain Injury.
Objective: Adolescent traumatic brain injury (TBI) is associated with a
wide variety of neurocognitive, psychosocial and behavioral problems.
Across levels of severity, social dysfunction has been identified as important area for intervention after injury; social withdrawal puts tremendous strain on caregivers and can exacerbate patient’s internalizing
symptoms. In an attempt to better understand the manifestation of social
isolation among this population, the authors explored the relative contribution of executive deficits in the area of planning and organization.
Participants and Methods: Participants included 18 adolescents
(ages 12-18), referred for neuropsychological assessment within a year
of sustaining a TBI. Injury severity varied across the group, but most
(~75%) had sustained a moderate to severe injuries. Parent-report of
executive planning was assessed using the “Plan-Organize” subscale of
the Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function (BRIEF). Parent
report of social withdrawal was measured using the “Withdrawal” subscale of the Behavior Assessment System for Children, Second Edition
(BASC-2: PRS-A).
Results: Pearson correlation indicated a significant association between
parent-report of executive planning and social withdrawal (r=.513,
p<.05), such that greater planning problems were associated with increases in withdrawal. Bootstrapped linear regression indicated that
over 25% of the variance observed in social withdrawal was explained
by executive planning (R2=.263, p<.05).
Conclusions: These findings suggest that deficits in planning skills
may significantly contribute to the development and maintenance of
social isolation among adolescents recovering from TBI. Use of validated
measures of executive functioning may compliment neuropsychological
testing by pointing to specific executive domains that predict social
dis-engagement in this population. Future studies should examine this
relationship with consideration of injury-related characteristics and
developmental factors.

Processing speed in pediatric head injury: Examining the impact
of psychiatric and learning comorbidities.
Objective: Processing speed is negatively impacted by pediatric head
injury. However, it is not clear whether head injury is associated with
processing speed difficulties over and above the influence of psychiatric
and learning comorbidities. Moreover, studies generally define processing speed narrowly, potentially using a single measure to characterize
this domain of cognitive functioning. Our aim was to compare processing
speed in head injured youth to a control group of youth matched on
psychiatric and learning comorbidities by employing a more nuanced
and multifaceted view of processing speed by studying a variety of
neuropsychological measures. We hypothesized that head injured youth
would demonstrate decreased processing speed compared to controls.
Participants and Methods: Participants were clinically referred youth
recruited from a pediatric neuropsychological assessment clinic and
enrolled in the LOGIC longitudinal study of cognition. A subgroup of
93 youth, ages 5 to 19 (M=11.2, SD=3.5), reported a history of head
injury and were compared to a control group of 93 non-head injured
youth, ages 3 to 19 (M=10.5, SD=3.8). The control group was matched
to the head injury group on primary psychiatric diagnosis and special
education status (i.e., whether or not they had an IEP). The groups were
compared across several neuropsychological measures of processing

38
speed (e.g., Wechsler Processing Speed Index [PSI], CPT Reaction Time,
DKEFS Trail Making Test).
Results: Preliminary analyses suggested no statistically significant
differences on the individual processing speed measures. Further, the
groups did not differ in terms of the percentage of participants scoring
1 standard deviation below of mean on the processing speed measures.
Conclusions: More work is needed to understand the impact of psychiatric and learning comorbidities on the cognitive functioning of youth
who sustain head injuries. The utility of a more nuanced, multifaceted
assessment of processing speed in pediatric neuropsychology will be
discussed.

Sustained Attention Moderates the Relationship between Sleep
Schedule Variability and Verbal Memory in Children with ADHD.
Objective: Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is characterized by impairments in sustained attention and executive functioning,
as well as variety of behavioral symptoms. Sleep problems and comorbid
sleep disorders are also prevalent among this population. Despite growing literature on sleep and cognition in ADHD, little is known about the
effects of specific sleep behaviors such as sleep schedule variability on
attention and memory functioning in children with ADHD. The current
study of youth with ADHD explored the relationships between sleep
schedule variability and performance on tests of sustained attention
and verbal memory.
Participants and Methods: Participants included 75 children with
ADHD (6-16 years) referred for neuropsychological assessment. Parent-report of variability in child sleep schedule was assessed using the
Heaton Children’s Sleep Questionnaire (HCSQ). Sustained attention
was assessed using the Test of Everyday Attention (TEA-Ch) sub test,
“Score!” Performance on the Word Pairs Learning subtest of the Children’s Memory Scale (CMS) was used to assess initial acquisition skills
on a verbal memory task.
Results: Bootstrapped moderation analysis indicated that sustained attention significantly moderated the relationship between parent-report
of sleep schedule variability and initial acquisition of information on
the verbal memory task, such that presence of sustained attention difficulties strengthened the relationship between sleep schedule variability
and poor verbal learning (R2= .109, p<.05).
Conclusions: Findings suggest that inconsistent sleep schedules in
childhood ADHD account for a small but significant amount of the
variability in verbal learning skills, and that this relationship may be
modified by a child’s capacity for sustained attention. Future studies
should investigate the relationships between sleep and cognition among
clinical pediatric populations in an effort to identify potential intervention targets among youth with high rates of both sleep and cognitive
difficulties.

Do sluggish cognitive tempo and slow processing speed represent
the same construct? Evidence for differentiation of functional
correlates in children and adolescents with ADHD.
Objective: The detrimental impact of slow processing speed has been
increasingly recognized; however, whether this construct maps directly
onto “sluggish cognitive tempo” (SCT) that has been described within
ADHD samples over the past decade remains unclear. Given that SCT is

tied more directly to ADHD symptoms, we hypothesized that variation in
SCT and processing speed would predict different functional correlates
within children and adolescents with ADHD.
Participants and Methods: Participants included 362 youth meeting DSM ADHD criteria (mean age=10 years, SD=3.1, range 3 to 20)
recruited from a pediatric neuropsychology clinic and enrolled in the
LOGIC study, a longitudinal investigation of genetics and cognition.
The potential incremental utility of SCT (measured by the CBCL)
and processing speed (measured by the Processing Speed Index from
Wechsler intelligence scales) to predict adaptive (ABAS General Adaptive Composite) and academic (composite of Word Reading and Numerical Operations from the WIAT) functioning, after controlling for
ADHD symptom burden (sum of parent reported symptoms on CSI-4)
was assessed using two hierarchical multiple regressions, one predicting
each of the functional correlates.
Results: Parent-report ADHD symptom ratings significantly predicted
the General Adaptive Composite (accounting for 16% of variance; β=.40, p<.001) and SCT added incrementally to the model, accounting
for an additional 5% of the variance (β=-.23, p=.001), while processing
speed did not add incrementally to this model. Processing speed did
contribute to the prediction of academic skills, accounting for 6% of the
variance (β=.27, p<.001). Neither ADHD symptom severity nor SCT
predicted academic functioning.
Conclusions: SCT and processing speed differentially predicted adaptive and academic functional abilities not accounted for by ADHD symptom burden. Such data support the separate measurement of processing
speed and SCT in ADHD samples. Clinical and research implications
will be discussed.

The ADHD Symptom Questionnaire (ASQ): Pilot Study on a DSM-5
Specific, Self-Report Questionnaire with Embedded Validity Items.
Objective: Currently, few neuropsychological assessments measure
ADHD symptoms using DSM-5 criteria and none include embedded
symptom validity items (Rösler et al., 2006). The current study introduces the ADHD Symptom Questionnaire (ASQ), a newly developed,
60-item, Likert-based (ranging from 1-6) measure of ADHD symptoms
that includes validity indicators.
Participants and Methods: Participants (n=47) were veterans referred
for possible ADHD who completed neuropsychological evaluation, including the Conner’s Adult Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Rating Scale
(CAARS:S-L) and the ASQ (<2 items missing) at a large VA medical
center. The ASQ includes separate scores for the 9 inattention (ASQ-I)
and 9 hyperactivity symptoms (ASQ-H), and 1 for non-ADHD symptoms (ASQ-N). Descriptives for and correlations among CAARS:S-L and
ASQ scales are reported. ASQ-I and ASQ-H endorsement were classified
into two group statuses when at least 5 symptoms were endorsed (mean
score>3.75) on either ASQ-I or ASQ-H then compared by group to
CAARS:S-L DSM IV scale scores.
Results: Mean scores for ASQ-I and ASQ-H symptoms ranged from
3.41 to 5.03 and 2.87 to 4.69, respectively. Three ASQ-I and 6 ASQ-H
symptoms were significantly correlated with their respective CAARS:S-L
DSM-IV scales. ASQ-N was positively correlated with the CAARS:S-L
Infrequency Index (Suhr et al., 2011; r=.57, p<.001). Being classified
positively for DSM-5 ADHD by either the ASQ-I and ASQ-H symptoms resulted in higher scores on respective CAARS:S-L DSM IV scales,
with Inattention, F(1,39)=21.00, p<.001, η2=.35, and Hyperactivity,
F(1,39)=7.63, p=.009, η2=.16.
Conclusions: Current results provide preliminary evidence that the
ASQ may be useful in clinical assessment of ADHD per DSM-5 criteria.
ASQ-N items appear to function well as embedded symptom validity

Goodbye to the Processing Speed Deficit? Performance of
Clinically-referred Children with and without ADHD on the
WISC-V.
Objective: Children with ADHD demonstrate slower processing than
both typically developing and clinical comparison peers on the Wechsler
Intelligence Scale for Children-IV (WISC-IV) Processing Speed Index
(PSI). Similarly, the technical manual of the newest edition, WISC-V,
reported a small sample of children with ADHD (n=48) to have lower
PSI scores than controls. Whether this pattern holds relative to a clinical
comparison group is unknown. The present study explored differences in
WISC-IV and WISC-V Index scores between children with and without
ADHD in a large clinical sample.
Participants and Methods: Participants included a mixed clinical
sample of children (M age=10.25±2.81 years) assessed using either the
WISC-IV (n=1443) or WISC-V (n=445) in a large outpatient neuropsychology clinic. Children who met DSM-5 ADHD criteria, per parent
ratings, were included in the ADHD group (n=1217), while all others
(n=671) comprised the clinical comparison group.
Results: Performance across indices shared by WISC-IV and WISC-V
[PSI, Working Memory (WMI), and Verbal Comprehension Index
(VCI)] was compared between WISC editions. Children with ADHD had
significantly lower mean PSI scores than the clinical comparison group
on the WISC-IV (p<.001, η2=.009), but not the WISC-V (p=0.540,
η2=.000). Within the ADHD group, PSI score means were significantly
higher on WISC-V (91.6) than WISC-IV (87.9; mean difference=3.76,
p=.001, η2=.01); whereas, there were no significant differences between
WISC versions on WMI (p=0.11, η2=.003) or VCI (p=.41, η2=.001).
Conclusions: While children with ADHD show a relative disadvantage
on the WISC-IV PSI compared to other clinical groups, this deficit
does not appear to extend to the WISC-V. Moreover, it may be that
children with ADHD actually perform better on the WISC-V than on
the WISC-IV, especially on the PSI.

D.W. BEEBE & M. DIFRANCESCO. fMRI Correlates of Diminished
Sustained Attention among Sleep-Restricted Adolescents.
Objective: Adolescents often get much less sleep on school nights than
is recommended, which can impair attention. Little is known about how
the adolescent brain responds to sleep restriction (SR). This neuroimaging study compared brain response to a vigilance task under healthy
sleep (HS) vs. SR.
Participants and Methods: Thirty-three typically-developing 14-16
year-olds underwent a 3-week within-subject randomized cross-over
protocol: a baseline week followed by 2 experimental weeks with 5
nights of 6.5 hours (SR) vs. 10 hours (HS) in bed. Protocol adherence
was verified via actigraphy. Teens underwent fMRI on the mornings at
the end of HS and SR while performing a version of the psychomotor
vigilance task that measured reaction time (RT) in response to stimuli
presented at random interstimulus intervals. Slow RT is suggestive of
inattention. Imaging data were analyzed using an event-related general
linear model, comparing the events with the slowest 20% vs. the fastest
20% of RT. We also examined event onset times 4 seconds preceding
the stimuli to capture anticipatory brain state.
Results: During SR, faster RT were linked to greater activation in striatum, motor cortex, and bilateral parietal areas, and less activation in the
medial frontal region, anterior cingulate, left insula, and precuneus. The
HS condition, however, resulted only in striatal activation for fast>slow
RT. Slow reactions were preceded by stronger activation in posterior

39
cingulate and fusiform/temporal regions during SR, and by stronger
activation in the hippocampus during HS.
Conclusions: During SR, episodes of inattention were preceded by “default-mode” brain states, followed by a presumably reactive increase in
activation of motor and attention regions. When well-rested, the same
teens showed less variation in activation between slow and fast RT. The
same brain circuits that underlie daydreaming appear to be particularly
relevant to inattention among chronically sleep-deprived teens.

A.P. BORSCHUK, C. RODWELLER & C.F. SALORIO. The Influence
of Comorbid Asthma on the Severity of Symptoms in Children with
Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder.
Objective: Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and asthma
are often comorbid diagnoses in childhood. Research indicates that children with asthma are more likely to develop ADHD symptomatology
than children without asthma. Children with either condition display
higher rates of problem behaviors and worse performance on measures
of executive functioning. It is unclear whether a comorbid diagnosis of
asthma significantly influences the expression of behavior, attention,
and executive functioning in children with ADHD. The current study
examines the association between asthma and ADHD symptoms in a
clinical sample.
Participants and Methods: Demographic and neuropsychological data
for children with a billing diagnosis of ADHD (mean age=10; 75% male)
were extracted from a clinical database. Families completed standard
rating scales as part of a neuropsychological assessment. Sixty patients
with a co-morbid asthma diagnosis were identified and matched by age
to a group of 60 patients with only ADHD.
Results: No differences were found between groups in any aspect of
executive functioning on the BRIEF. In contrast, analyses revealed
higher parent report of behavioral symptoms (p<.05), anxiety (p<.01),
and internalizing (p<.01) on the BASC-2 in children with both asthma
and ADHD compared to those with ADHD alone. Additionally, 37% of
children with asthma and ADHD displayed clinically elevated hyperactivity, while only 15% of children with ADHD alone had clinically
elevated scores.
Conclusions: Results suggest that in children with ADHD, co-morbid
asthma is associated with increased behavioral and internalizing symptoms. Increased behavioral and internalizing symptoms seen in children
with both asthma and ADHD may be due to their medical condition
(e.g., anxiety due to medical regimen or recurrent asthma attacks). No
difference was found on cognitive variables, suggesting chronic hypoxia
may be less influential in explaining these differences. More research is
needed to determine specific mechanisms of these differences.

M. CAIRNCROSS & C.J. MILLER. The Efficacy of MindfulnessBased Therapies for Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder: A
Meta-analytic Review.
Objective: Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a highly
prevalent neurobehavioral disorder, which manifests as developmentally
inappropriate pervasive and persistent inattention, and hyperactivity-impulsivity. Given that the symptoms of ADHD result in significant
impairment in multiple areas of functioning, developing new treatments
has important implications for the quality of life of individuals who
suffer from ADHD. In recent years, mindfulness-based therapies (MBT)
have been introduced as a potential treatment for individuals with
ADHD. Although research has demonstrated MBT to be a moderately
effective treatment for internally-focused disorders, it is still unclear
whether MBT can provide improved functioning for individuals with
externalizing disorders such as ADHD. In order to clarify the literature

40
on the efficacy of MBT in treating ADHD an effect size analysis was
conducted.
Participants and Methods: A systematic review of studies published
in PsycINFO, PubMed, and Google Scholar was completed from the
earliest available date until December 2014. Following the collection
of all data that met the inclusion criteria, the data were synthesized to
estimate the overall effect size of MBT on core ADHD symptoms (i.e.
attention and hyperactivity-impulsivity).
Results: A total of eight studies were included in the analysis of inattention and the overall effect size was d= -.72. A total of seven studies
were included in the analysis of hyperactivity-impulsivity and the overall
effect was calculated at d= -.60. Thus, results demonstrated that MBT
significantly reduced inattention and hyperactivity-impulsvity in individuals diagnosed with ADHD.
Conclusions: This study highlights the possible benefits of MBT in
reducing symptoms of ADHD by providing preliminary evidence for the
efficacy of MBT for ADHD. The present study can help to guide future
research, by bringing attention to the need for more methodologically
rigorous experimental studies to provide more evidence for the use of
MBT in individuals with ADHD.

J.B. DYKSTRA, E.Y. LEE & J. SUHR. Self-Handicapping Strategies
in Emerging Adults Concerned about ADHD.
Objective: When faced with an evaluative task, some individuals engage
in self-handicapping, which consists of reporting on the presence of
impediments or actively creating barriers to success in order to preserve self-esteem in the event of failure. The present study objectives
were to examine the impact of evaluative threat on self-handicapping
efforts and evaluate the impact of self-handicapping on subsequent
neuropsychological task performance among emerging adults with a
concern for ADHD.
Participants and Methods: 103 emerging adults (ages 18 to 24) completed a working memory task. Participants were randomly assigned
to either be told that the task was a measure of intelligence (N = 51)
or that the task was a prototype for a Smartphone application (N =
52). All participants then completed self-report measures of ADHD
symptoms as well as a self-handicapping checklist. They were then
introduced to a computerized task of working memory (Dual 2-Back)
and allowed to practice the task as many times as they wished before
starting the test trial.
Results: Independent t-tests and chi-square analyses showed that
evaluative threat groups did not differ in self-handicapping efforts (all
ps > .05). Regression analyses highlighted a role for individual differences in self-reported symptoms, such that individuals with higher trait
self-handicapping, neuroticism, and depressive symptoms were more
likely to report more general barriers to performance and higher ADHD
symptoms, regardless of evaluative threat group (ps = .001-.04). Further, within the evaluative threat group, those with higher risk factors
who engaged in self-handicapping demonstrated worse performance on
the Dual 2-Back (ps = .005-.05).
Conclusions: The present study highlights the interplay of factors that
may contribute to somatization tendencies and non-credible responding.
In addition, the present study found evidence to suggest that high risk
factors and self-handicapping behavior can have a negative influence
on task performance in an evaluative threat context.

S.A. CHEN, J.B. HALE, H.A. KUBAS, J.W. WITZKE, K. MURPHY
& J. MCKEE. Research Domain Criteria for Deciphering ADHD
Executive Heterogeneity.
Objective: ADHD is a neurodevelopmental disorder traditionally defined using behavioral criteria. We applied a research domain criteria
(RDoC) approach to define dimensional symptoms instead of focusing
on behavioral subtyping to decipher the neuropsychological heterogeneity that is often observed.
Participants and Methods: Participants (N = 55; M age=121.07
months, SD=15.99) enrolled in an ADHD RCT methylphenidate study
were administered consent, baseline testing, and parent ratings by neuropsychologist-supervised RAs in a secure laboratory setting.
Results: A relaxed-eigenvalue principal components analysis with Kaiser-normalized varimax rotation of BASC-II subscales converged in 6
iterations (eigenvalues .54 to 4.98), revealing 4 main dimensions of
Conduct-Aggression (CA), Inattention-Hyperactivity (AH), Anxiety-Depression (AD), and Depression-Withdrawal (DW) symptoms, explaining
87.81% of the variance. Dimensions were differentially related to BRIEF
Behavioral Regulation (significant CA and AD r range .28 to .60) and
Metacognition (significant AH and DW r range .32 to .69) indices,
thought to be consistent with frontal-subcortical circuit (FSC) studies
and circuit balance theory. Conners’ CPT-II variables were correlated
with the CA and AH (significant CA and AD r range .27 to .36), but not
with AD or DW (NS). PCA z-scores (>0) and forced-entry discriminant
function analyses were used to create RDoC-determined externalizing
(CA-AH) and internalizing (AD-DW) subtypes. Seven out of the 12
CPT-II variables (Wilks’ λ range .72 to .83, p range .008 to .048) discriminated between groups, with an overall 92% classification accuracy.
Conclusions: Children with AD or DW attention problems do not appear to have the FSC circuit or executive patterns associated with AH or
CA. Those with externalizing AH/CA ADHD may be more likely to show
robust ADHD treatment response. Implications for ADHD research,
diagnosis, and treatment will be addressed.

A. KANDASAMY. Eye-Tracking as a Behavioural Measure of
Impulsivity.
Objective: Impulsivity is a multifaceted construct that is primarily
measured using self-report questionnaires and behavioural tasks. However, often, behavioural measures of impulsivity do not align well with
self-report measures, such as the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale - Eleventh
Edition (BIS-11; Stanford, et al., 2009). One proposed mechanism for
this phenomenon is that both modalities capture different dimensions
of impulsivity (Vigil-Colet, 2011). Eye-tracking and reaction time are
behavioural measures that may provide insight into the same features
found using self-reported impulsive behaviours.
Participants and Methods: Eye-tracking and reaction time were
recorded during the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test - Fourth Edition digital stimulus book administration, and output (saccadic speed,
pupillary dilation, and fixation duration), was used to predict impulsivity, as measured by the BIS-11. In addition, demographic factors,
including ADHD diagnosis, age, gender, and SES, were considered.
Participants were 64 undergraduate students (50 women, 14 men) at
a medium-sized, ethnically diverse, university in southwestern Ontario.
Results: Hierarchical regressions showed slower reaction time and
smaller pupil dilation predicted greater impulsivity, consistent with
previous research regarding working memory and time-use in individuals with high impulsivity. Impulsivity was related to ADHD diagnosis
and gender.
Conclusions: Findings lend insight into the disparity between self-report and behavioural measures of impulsivity and provide the foundation for developing behavioural instruments that measure the same
dimensions of impulsivity captured by self-report measures.

J. JANECEK & N. PLISKIN. Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity
Disorder (ADHD) in Adults: Neuropsychological Referrals in an
Academic Medical Center.
Objective: It is estimated that 4.4% of adults in the United States and
3.4% worldwide suffer from ADHD (Kessler et al., 2006; Fayyad et al.,
2007). With increased use of objective tests for diagnostic clarification,
neuropsychology has seen increased referrals for adult ADHD. However,
clinicians’ accurate knowledge of ADHD diagnostic criteria is necessary
to make appropriate referrals (Gordon et al., 2006). This study examined clinical characteristics of patients referred to an academic medical
center for a neuropsychological evaluation related to suspected ADHD,
and examined the relationships between self-report measures, and test
performance.
Participants and Methods: Archival records included referral sources,
previous histories, and diagnoses for 77 adult patients referred to an
academic medical center with concerns of ADHD. A subset (n=44) had
been administered the Clinical Assessment of Attention Deficit-Adult
(CAt-A), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II), Pittsburgh Sleep Quality
Index (PSQI), and Conners’ Continuous Performance Test (CPT II).
Results: 39% of patients were diagnosed with ADHD after an evaluation; ADHD was ruled out for 45.5% of the sample. For the remaining
15.5%, other variables (e.g., sleep disturbance, significant mood symptoms) prevented accurate determination of ADHD diagnosis. A logistic
regression demonstrated a significant relationship between previous and
current ADHD diagnosis (B=1.31, p=.01). Linear regressions indicated
that self-reported symptoms on the CAt-A were significantly associated
with PSQI, R2=.16, F(42,1)=, p<.01, and BDI-II, R2=.10, F(42,1)=,
p<.05, but not with CPT scores.
Conclusions: Fewer than 40% of referrals received a diagnosis after
a comprehensive neuropsychological evaluation. Self-reported ADHD
symptoms were significantly associated with self-reported depressive
symptoms and sleep difficulties. Healthcare providers and patients
would benefit from increased education regarding ADHD in adults
and improved interdisciplinary communication regarding diagnostic
guidelines.

S.H. MOSTOFSKY & M. MAHONE. Can a 75-Second Motor
Persistence Test Predict ADHD in School-Aged Children?
Objective: The current study sought to examine the clinical utility of
a brief measure of motor persistence for identifying attentional impairment in a large pediatric sample of children with and without attention
deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).
Participants and Methods: A total of 624 children (n=362 typically
developing—TD, 64% male; n=262 ADHD, 67% male), ages 6-12
years, completed a task of motor persistence and inhibition (NEPSY-II
Statue) during which they were asked to maintain a fixed body position
with eyes closed for 75 seconds while the examiner made a series of
distracting noises. Observations were made every 5 seconds to track
errors (i.e., body movements, eye opening, or talking). Total raw score
(range: 1-30) was the dependent variable. For analyses, participants
were grouped into the following age bands: 6-8 years (n=173); 9-10
years (n=297); 11-12 years (n=154).
Results: Across each age band, performance on the task improved in
both groups; however, TD children demonstrated better motor persistence than did children with ADHD (p<0.001). Additionally, the
proportion of TD children reaching scores at or near ceiling (i.e., ≥27)
was significantly greater (66%, 74%, and 90%) than children with

41
ADHD (30%, 38%, and 51%) in the three bands (6-8, 9-10, 11-12)
respectively (χ2<0.001). Sensitivity, specificity, and receiver operating
characteristic (ROC) curves were examined for predicting ADHD diagnosis across each age band for the Statue Total. Statue Total was a fair
predictor of ADHD across all age bands (AUC range=0.73-0.76) and
optimal cut-scores of 11, 18, and 21 were identified for age bands 6-8,
9-10, and 11-12 respectively, that maximized both sensitivity (95-98%)
and specificity (77-84%).
Conclusions: The NEPSY-II Statue task represents a very brief,
easy-to-administer measure of motor persistence that demonstrates excellent sensitivity and specificity for classifying children with ADHD.
Normative data from a large TD reference sample are included for each
age (year) between 6 and 12 years.

suggests that self-regulation deficits in individuals with ADHD may be
related to impulsive symptoms, but little research has examined the
association of self-regulation difficulties and executive functioning. The
present study examined the relationship of self-reported impulsivity
and self-regulation problems to performance on a behavioral measure
of inhibition in a healthy undergraduate sample.
Participants and Methods: As part of a larger study, self-report measures of psychopathology, including the Conners Adult ADHD Rating
Scales (CAARS) and the Urgency, Premeditation, Perseverance and
Sensation-seeking Scale (UPPS) and the Color-Word Interference Test
(CWIT) of the Delis-Kaplan Executive Function System were administered to 60 healthy undergraduates (13 males, age range=18-27). Scale
C of the CAARS was divided into separate impulsivity and self-regulation subscales (as in Mitchell et al., 2012).
Results: Self-reported impulsivity and poor self-regulation of CAARS
scale C were related to responses on the Urgency subscale in the UPPS,
both r=.60, p<.001. Urgency was negatively correlated with CAARS
DSM Inattention, r=-.53, p<.001, and Hyperactivity/Impulsivity symptoms r=-.29, p=.03. CAARS DSM Inattention symptoms, r=.02, p=.91,
and Hyperactivity/Impulsivity symptoms, r=.08, p=.58, were not related to behavioral inhibition on the CWIT. Self-reported impulsivity
was not related to task performance, r=.03, p=.57, but high self-reported self-regulation was related to better behavioral inhibition on the
CWIT, r=-.30, p=.027.
Conclusions: These findings suggest that self-regulation is important in
executive function tasks that require inhibitory control. Future studies
should examine these relationships in samples of individuals who meet
diagnostic criteria for ADHD, as well as include additional executive
function measures.

J.M. NELSON & S.W. LIEBEL. ADHD Symptoms among
College Students: Cross-Informant Agreement, Intra-Informant
Agreement and Relationships with Neuropsychological
Functioning.
Objective: The purpose of this study was to investigate cross-informant agreement of current ADHD symptoms among college students,
intra-informant agreement of these symptoms across time (current
and retrospective childhood symptoms), and the relationships between
these symptoms with scores from neuropsychological instruments used
to measure attention and related abilities.

42
Participants and Methods: A large sample (N = 434) of college students referred for potential attention and/or learning disorders received
a comprehensive neuropsychological evaluation at a university-based
clinic. Participants and their parents also completed measures of past
and current symptoms of ADHD. These measures included the Conners
Adult ADHD Rating Scale and the College ADHD Response Evaluation.
Results: Low cross-informant agreement was found between parent
and self-reports of current inattentive symptoms, although correlations
between these reports were statistically significant (rs = .22 - .37, ps
< .001). Moderate cross-informant agreement was found for current
hyperactive-impulsive symptoms (rs =.46 - .50, ps < .001). Low intra-informant agreement for parent reported childhood and current
inattentive symptoms was found (rs = .35 - .41, ps < .001), whereas low
to moderate intra-informant agreement was found for hyperactive-impulsive symptoms (rs = .47 - .68, ps < .001). Correlations between current ADHD symptoms and scores on the Integrated Visual and Auditory
continuous performance test and relevant WAIS-IV (working memory
and processing speed) and WMS-IV (immediate memory) subtests were
either not significant or significant but in the small range (most rs in
the -.10 range).
Conclusions: Results illustrate the inconsistent data that are often derived from adult ADHD evaluations. Evaluation data were particularly
inconsistent when comparing reported ADHD symptomatology and
performance on neuropsychological measures. Recommendations for
valid identification of ADHD among college students will be discussed.

S.W. LIEBEL & J.M. NELSON. Auditory and Visual Working
Memory in College Students with ADHD.
Objective: Children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder
(ADHD) have been shown to have weaker auditory and visual working
memory (WM) compared to non-ADHD children, and these differences
are greatest in VWM (Martinussen, Hayden, Hogg-Johnson, & Tannock,
2005). While it is known that ADHD persists into adulthood, little research has investigated WM deficits in college-aged adults specifically.
The present study examined potential differences in AWM and VWM
in a large sample of college-aged adults.
Participants and Methods: One hundred and thirty-seven college
students with ADHD received a comprehensive neuropsychological
evaluation at a university-based clinic. All participants were administered selected portions of the WAIS-IV, WMS-IV, and WJ-III. A paired
samples t-test analyzed overall differences in AWM and VWM ability.
Hierarchical multiple regression models analyzed the unique contributions of AWM and VWM in predicting general math calculation skills.
Results: In this sample and contrary to previous findings, participants’
AWM was worse than VWM (t[136] = -2.827, p = .005). Additionally,
after controlling for general ability and cognitive processing speed, AWM
was a significant contributor to math calculation skills (nR2 = .234,
p < .001) but VWM was not (nR2 = .004, p = .39). Overall, general
ability, cognitive processing speed, and AWM significantly predicted
math calculation skills (R2 = .524, F[3, 84] = 29.756, p < .001).
Conclusions: The pattern of stronger AWM compared to VWM found
in children with ADHD was not found in this adult sample. AWM appears to be more important than VWM for college students with ADHD.

K.S. MAZZOLA, M.A. PIEVSKY, L. ABUELHIGA, B. FREER &
L. TIERSKY. The Effect of Comorbid Depression in Adult ADHD
on the CAARS.
Objective: Both ADHD and depression affect cognitive functioning, and
there is a high rate of comorbidity between the two. However, little research has specifically looked at comorbid depression in ADHD, despite
a possible additive effect on cognitive functioning. It is hypothesized

that those with comorbid depression will have higher self- and observer
ratings on the Conner’s Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS).
Participants and Methods: 90 participants completed the CAARS as
part of a larger neuropsychological battery. Clinicians assigned clinical
diagnoses based on information from clinical interviews and test data
from a full neuropsychological assessment. Three groups were created:
ADHD only, depression only, and comorbid ADHD and depression.
Results: A MANOVA was conducted to test the effect of participants’
diagnoses on the factors of the CAARS. The comorbid group rated higher
than the ADHD group on both self- and observer-rated self-concept
problems, p=.023 and p=.027. The comorbid group scored higher than
the depression group on observer ratings for DSM-inattention symptoms, p=.028, and DSM-ADHD symptoms, p=.012. Finally, the comorbid group scored higher than the depression group on observer-rated
inattention and memory symptoms, p=.043.
Conclusions: This study shows that those with comorbid depression
and ADHD differ from ADHD on self-concept, both self- and observer-rated, indicating a possible lower self-esteem and self-efficacy in
the comorbid group. In addition, it was found that observers reported
more problems with inattention and memory symptoms for those with
comorbid depression and ADHD compared to those with depression,
despite self-rated measures not showing these differences. There was
no difference between the ADHD group and the comorbid group on
self-reported inattention and memory symptoms. These findings suggest that clinicians should be aware that individuals with a comorbid
depression and ADHD diagnosis might have lower self-concept that
could impede treatment.

A.M. COLBERT, K. OSWALD, R. LAJINESS-O’NEILL, K. SAULES,
W. HARRELL & J. BO. Working Memory Assessment and
Symptoms of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder in Children.
Objective: Working memory (WM) may be a core deficit of ADHD,
and the WM theory of ADHD could provide increased understanding of
ADHD. However, clinical and experimental measurement of WM often
utilize differing tasks, which may elicit different constructs. Research
examining relationships between WM and ADHD is also inconsistent,
and evaluation of ADHD symptoms versus diagnosis may clarify this
relationship. The first objective was to compare experimental paradigms
and clinical assessment of WM. The second objective was to investigate
the relationship between WM and ADHD symptoms.
Participants and Methods: As ADHD symptoms rather than ADHD
diagnosis is being measured, we included male children with and without formal diagnosis of ADHD. In the sample (N = 50, M = 9.12, range
= 6-12 years), 20% were previously diagnosed with ADHD. Participants
completed the WASI-II, WISC-IV WMI and Arithmetic subtest, Automated Working Memory Assessment-2, and change-detection tasks.
Parents completed the Conners 3-P. Relationships were examined via
Pearson correlation and hierarchical regression.
Results: Results indicated computerized change-detection tasks may
not effectively elicit WM in young children, though a trend for developmental increase in WM was found (r = .31-.33; p < .05). The WISC-IV
Arithmetic subtest was most consistently related to other WM measures
(r = .34-.44; p < .05). The Arithmetic and Digit Span Backward subtests
were most consistently related to inattentive symptoms (r = -.44 & -.42
respectively; p < .01) though significant variance was still unaccounted
for (R2 = .19; p = .002), and no WM measure was consistently related
to hyperactive/impulsive symptoms.
Conclusions: Arithmetic was a better measure of WM than other WM
measures, and measurement of ADHD inattentive symptoms best characterized relationships between ADHD and WM. Results highlight the
need for enhanced WM measurement and consistency between measures, as well as the utility of considering symptom presentation versus
categorical diagnosis.

The Use of Neuropsychological Measures in ADHD Diagnosis.
Objective: There is much debate about the use of neuropsychological
measures to diagnose ADHD. A meta-analysis conducted by Hervey,
Epstein, and Curry (2004) revealed that most neuropsychological measures are only modestly correlated with a diagnosis of ADHD in adults.
The present study evaluated how well neuropsychological measures and
self-report scales predict clinical diagnosis of ADHD.
Participants and Methods: Participants were 164 individuals tested
at an outpatient clinic in the northeast US. Participants completed a
neuropsychological test battery that included the PASAT, Conners’
CPT-II omission errors, Conners’ CPT-II commission errors, D-KEFS
tower test number of moves, CVLT-II learning trials 1-5, and Conners’
Adult ADHD Rating Scales Self Report inattention/memory problems,
hyperactivity/restlessness, impulsivity/emotional lability, and problems
with self-concept scales. Clinicians assigned a diagnosis of ADHD based
on information from clinical interviews and test data.
Results: Binary logistic regression was used to test the prediction power
of the above measures, those most highly correlated with ADHD diagnosis, on the likelihood of receiving a diagnosis of ADHD. The model was
significant, χ2(10) = 38.93, p < .05. Sensitivity was .33, and specificity
was .93. Only two of the measures uniquely predicted ADHD diagnosis:
CVLT-II learning trials 1-5 (B = -.05, OR = .95) and CAARS inattention/memory problems (B = .08, OR = 1.08).
Conclusions: These neuropsychological and self-report measures were
able to predict whether an individual would be diagnosed with ADHD,
but with low sensitivity. The criteria clinicians used to diagnose ADHD
appear to share little variance with these measures. Indeed historically,
the relationships that have been found between neuropsychological measures and ADHD diagnosis are typically weak (Hervey et al., 2004). Future research may benefit from the use of alternative criteria for defining
ADHD and should further explore the role of verbal memory in ADHD.

M. PINJALA. Component Structure of Multiple Tests of Attention
in a Mixed Clinical Child Sample.
Objective: The goal of this study was to examine the components of attention assessed by commonly used neuropsychological tests in children.
This study employed scores obtained from a continuous performance
task, span tasks, pencil and paper tests and behavioral rating scales.
Participants and Methods: A Principal Components Analysis was
utilized to explain the variance in test scores and to reduce the data
into components related to different domains of attention. Participants
consisted of 235 children aged 6-16 years old (M = 10, SD = 2.95),
who were predominantly female (63%) and right handed (89%), with
a mean education level of 4 years (SD = 2.8). The participants were
diagnosed with a variety of psychological and neurological disorders
and comprised a mixed clinical sample.
Results: Results of the current study confirmed the utility of these
tests to measure multiple aspects of attention by using a variety of approaches, as five components emerged. The first component explained
27.6% of the variance and was determined to measure Vigilance, the
second explained 11.5% of the variance and was labelled Mental Tracking, the third accounted for 8.2% of the variance and was deemed
Impulsivity, the fourth accounted for 8.2% of the variance and it was
determined that the components measured Behavioral Inattention and
the fifth component, which accounted for 6.1% of the variance was
labelled as Attentional Fatigue.
Conclusions: The findings of the study provide useful information to
those studying underlying mechanisms of attentional processes in a

43
developmental context, as well as to clinicians providing comprehensive evaluations of children with various clinical presentations. Further
studies should examine attention patterns in individual subgroups of
disorders to further bolster knowledge about attentional deficits in a
variety of patient populations.

R.C. RECIO, L. AGUERREVERE, T.J. SWIFT, R.C. NICKS,
C. WYKOFF & K. MELTON. Effects of One Neurofeedback Session
on Verbal and Visuospatial Search.
Objective: Neurofeedback (NF) training measures brain activity via
electroencephalogram (EEG), and rewards specific brain patterns. NF
training has been suggested as a possible brain-based supplemental
therapy for patients with attention deficit disorder (Butnik, 2005).
However, there is a scarcity of well-designed studies that present the
actual effects of this technique on the component of attention (e.g.
visual search, focusing, and distraction). The purpose of this study was
to experimentally determine the beneficial effects of one NF session on
attention-related visual search.
Participants and Methods: Healthy college students (N= 119) were
randomly assigned to one of three training protocols: a left hemisphere
NF training (LH; N = 41), a right hemisphere NF training (RH; N=41),
or a sham protocol (Sham; N =37).After training, participants completed two visual search tasks: verbal (i.e. word finding) and visuospatial
(i.e. animal finding). Strong fixations in these tasks were indicative of
“finding” and these were measured via eye tracking technology.
Results: Results indicated that one session of NF had a significant effect
on both verbal and visuospatial search (verbal search, F [2,116] = 5.24,
p<.01, partial η2=.08; visuospatial search, F [2,116] = 3.73, p<.05,
partial η2=.06). Those trained on the right hemisphere (m =17.97,sd
= 2.67) found fewer words than the other protocols (LF m=19.32, sd
= 2.20; Sham m= 19.54, sd = 1.97). Participants trained on the left
hemisphere (m =6.69, sd = 1.47) found fewer visual images than the
other protocols (RF m=7.35, sd = 1.10; Sham m= 7.41, sd = 0.89).
Conclusions: The current study found detrimental effects from one
NF session on visual search when training occurred in the skill-specific non-dominant hemisphere. Beneficial effects of one NF session on
visual search tasks were not observed. This study demonstrated that
one session NF training can have measurable effects on neuropsychological performance, even if these are disruptive. Clinical implications
are discussed.

M.M. TABAQUIM, M.F. PEREIRA & M.R. FERRO. Child attentional
functions with Cleft Lip and Palate.
Objective: To investigate the neuropsychological skills of the attention
of children with repaired cleft lip and palate (CLP); to characterize the
neuropsychological skills profile of attention in this population, including selectivity, support, and alternation; to compare attentional levels
between groups of children with pre-foramen clefts, post-foramen, and
incisive Trans.
Participants and Methods: The sample comprised 111 subjects, both
genders, between 7 and 12 years, diagnosed with FLP isolated. The
instruments used were Colored Progressive Matrices of Raven: Special
Scale; School Performance Test (TDE); Divided Attention Test - Form
1 (TEDIF-1); Visual Attention Test (TAVIS-4); Test Wisconsin Card
Sorting (WCST); and Stroop Color and Word Test. The data were categorized and described as strainers and calculation and interpretation
tables contained in each instrument manual.
Results: Males reported a higher incidence and the predominant type
was the transforame fissure. The brainpower in reasoning tasks for most

44
participants was within average range. Reading and writing were characterized by levels below average for their age for both reading activities
(85.59%) and writing (73.87%), indicating basic learning difficulties.
Conclusions: Children with cleft lip and palate demonstrate changes
in attentional skills. Those with post-foramen fissure possess greater
attentional losses in the selectivity and switching of attention, those
with the transforame type require attentional support, and those with
pre-foramen require commitments in the three components of attention,
with statistical significance compared to Transforame.

M.M. THOMASON, R. CAMPBELL & A. ROWLAND. Concentration
Deficit Disorder: Prevalence, Associated Impairment, and
Comorbidities in a Population-Based Sample.
Objective: Concentration Deficit Disorder (CDD; AKA Sluggish Cognitive Tempo) is a controversial diagnosis that has received significant
research attention. Research on CDD and Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) has supported the conceptualization of CDD
as a distinct disorder frequently comorbid with ADHD, particularly
Inattentive Type. Prevalence estimates from population based samples
estimate 5.1% of adults and 5.7% of youth meet CDD criteria. This
study examined prevalence and relationship of CDD symptoms with
functioning and other symptomatology.
Participants and Methods: Parents of 951 children enrolled in 17
public elementary schools in grades 1-5 provided ratings of ADHD and
related symptoms. Prevalence rates of CDD were based on five items
from the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) previously used in other
studies of CDD. Respondents had to rate each of the items as occurring
“Often” or “Very often” to meet criteria. Hierarchical regressions examined the variance in global impairment (defined by the score on the
Columbia Impairment Scale) and CBCL scales (Withdrawn, Somatic
Complaints, Anxious/Depressed, Social Problems, Thought Problems,
Delinquent Behavior, and Aggressive Behavior) explained by CDD, after
controlling for grade, sex, ethnicity, and family income.
Results: Prevalence rates appeared lower than previous estimates of
5.7%, depending on which combination of CBCL items was utilized.
CDD explained a significant amount of variance in impairment and all
CBCL scales after controlling for variance explained by demographic
factors (R2 change values: 0.15-0.52).
Conclusions: Prevalence rates from the current study are lower than
those found in other studies. This is likely due to reliance on parent
report alone. Previous literature suggests teachers are more apt to recognize symptoms of CDD than parents. Study findings reveal increased
comorbidities and increased functional impairment associated with increased CDD symptomatology.

M.D. UDHNANI, A.M. CHAMBERS, A.L. FRIAS, C.E. TYNER
& S.C. HEATON. Not All Visual Memory Tasks Are Created
Equal: Sustained Attention May Explain Pediatric Performance
Differences.
Objective: Childhood ADHD is characterized by prominent attentional
and executive dysfunction, but not typically associated with primary
memory dysfunction. However, memory tasks with high attentional
demands may produce misleading memory deficits in populations with
prominent attentional dysfunction, such as ADHD. The Children’s
Memory Scale (CMS) is a widely used test of memory functions, but
one of the two visual memory tasks (Faces) is designed in a manner that
we hypothesize requires stronger sustained attention skills. The current
study examines performance of children with ADHD on the two core

visual attention tasks of the CMS and the relationship with sustained
attention skills.
Participants and Methods: Participants included 228 children diagnosed with ADHD (ages 6-16) referred for neuropsychological assessment. Performance on the CMS Dot Locations (Learning score) and
Faces (Immediate score) was examined, and correlations were run with
sustained auditory attention skills as measured by the “Score!” subtest
of the Test of Everyday Attention for Children (TEA-Ch).
Results: Although performance at the group level was comparable
across visual memory tasks, sustained attention performance correlated significantly with performance on the CMS Faces task (R2=.190,
p=.003), but not with Dot Locations performance (R2=.105, p=.071).
Conclusions: Though preliminary in nature, the current results support hypothesized differences in CMS visual memory task performance
and suggest that performance on the Faces subtest is confounded with
sustained attention skills. Results need to be confirmed in a mixed clinical sample, but findings suggest that clinicians and researchers should
be mindful about task design when selecting a test to assess memory
functions in populations with attentional deficits.

B. VAN MEURS, A. DAVIS, N. CRUZ, A. MCLAUGHLIN, N. LYONS,
K. SADOWSKI & J. DORFLINGER. Processing Speed, Attention
and Executive Functioning in ADHD with and without Co-morbid
Anxiety.
Objective: ADHD and anxiety overlap in symptomatology, and are
frequently co-morbid, however the nature of the overlap is not well
understood. Some studies demonstrate reduced effectiveness and more
adverse reactions to stimulant medications when ADHD is comorbid
with anxiety. Others demonstrate differences in reaction times, working
memory and inhibition in these groups. The present study aimed to
investigate the relationship between several neurocognitive measures
across these groups.
Participants and Methods: Participants included all individuals who
received an extensive diagnostic assessment at a community medical
center and received a diagnosis of ADHD and/or Anxiety, and those
with known neurological insult were excluded. Groups (Anxiety-Only,
ADHD-Only, Comorbid) were compared on several measures in the
domains of: attention, executive functioning (EF), processing speed
(PSI), and motor speed.
Results: The ADHD-Only group scored significantly below the Anxiety-Only group in every domain. Conversely the ADHD group and
the co-morbid group did not differ on any measure. Post-hoc analyses
revealed that co-morbid anxiety moderated the relationship between
PSI and measures of attention and EF in those with ADHD. Moderately
strong relationships between PSI and several measures of EF present
in the ADHD-Only group were either completely abolished or significantly reduced in the comorbid group. In contrast, moderately strong
relationships between PSI and verbal/auditory attention present in the
comorbid group were not present in the ADHD-Only group.
Conclusions: The relationship between PSI and attention and EF differs across groups, suggesting different mechanisms of attention and
EF deficits in individuals with comorbid anxiety. The dissociation of
these measures across groups and future research into this phenomenon
can help with diagnosis and treatment planning for individuals with
comorbid symptom presentation in order to optimize treatment effects.

R. VAN PATTEN, C. KEITH, M. BERTOLIN & J.D. WRIGHT. The
Effect of Premorbid Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder on
Neuropsychological Functioning in Individuals with Acute Mild
Traumatic Brain Injuries.
Objective: Mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) is a frequent, yet undertreated condition that typically manifests with transient neurological and cognitive symptoms that resolve over the course of several
weeks. In contrast, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is
a neurodevelopmental disorder that presents initially in childhood but
often persists into adulthood. MTBI and ADHD include overlapping
symptomatology, making it difficult for clinicians to disentangle the
sequelae of each condition when they co-occur in the same individual.
We hypothesized that neuropsychological tests would be sensitive to
preexisting ADHD in inpatients with acute mTBIs.
Participants and Methods: We retrospectively examined the medical
charts of 100 18 – 40-year-old inpatients (96% Caucasian; 77% male)
with mTBIs in an acute care setting, half of whom had self-reported the
presence of premorbid ADHD, and half of whom were matched controls.
We analyzed group differences across neuropsychological tests of attention, processing speed, and executive functions and examined the profile
ratings of independent, blinded, board certified neuropsychologists.
Results: Individuals with premorbid ADHD a) performed significantly
worse than their matched counterparts on several tests of attention,
processing speed, and working memory, and b) were significantly more
likely to produce profiles later rated as impaired by independent, board
certified clinical neuropsychologists.
Conclusions: These findings a) argue for the utility of a brief assessment of premorbid ADHD in the acute care of individuals with mTBIs
and b) provide clinicians with a barometer for gauging the relative
contributions of premorbid ADHD to neuropsychological impairments
in the neurocognitive profiles of individuals with mTBIs. Reported effect
sizes will assist clinicians in accurately weighing the impact of premorbid
ADHD when interpreting such profiles.

A. WEIGARD, A. HEATHCOTE, S. BROWN & C. HUANGPOLLOCK. A Model-Based Assessment of Slow vs. Variable
Information Processing in ADHD.
Objective: Response times (RT) of children with ADHD are more variable than those of their peers and analysis with the drift diffusion model
(DDM: Ratcliff & McKoon, 2008) has suggested that slowed information
processing explains this variability (Huang-Pollock et al., 2013; Karalunas et al., 2012). However, factors such as lapses of attention, lower
signal-to-noise ratios, or increases in contaminant RTs (e.g., guessing)
may explain RT variability better than inefficient processing speed.
The current study uses a model-comparison analysis with the DDM and
linear ballistic accumulator model (LBA: Brown & Heathcote, 2008) to
test these possibilities.
Participants and Methods: Children with ADHD (80) and age- and
IQ-matched typically developing controls (32) completed a numerosity
discrimination paradigm in which they decided whether arrays contained many (>50) or few (<50) asterisks at two levels of difficulty.
RT data was fit to the DDM and LBA models, and a model-comparison
approach was used to determine the best fitting models.
Results: Consistent with prior research, DDM analyses indicated that
children with ADHD displayed slower information processing than their
typically developing peers, F(1,110)= 29.29,p<.001. The LBA model,
despite fitting the behavioral data better, did not reveal significant group
effects in variability in information processing, speed of correct information processing or error information processing, suggesting that there
may be sub-groups with different patterns of deficits.
Conclusions: Heterogeneity in information processing would be consistent with work documenting the neuropsychological heterogeneity of
ADHD (Fair et al., 2012). Implications of possible sub-group deficits
will be discussed as they relate to etiological theories of ADHD that posit

45
inefficient processing (Killeen et al., 2013), poorer attentional control
(Kofler et al., 2014), or reduced signal-to-noise ratios (Castellanos et
al., 2009) as the cause of variable performance in the disorder.

R. FRIED, J. BIEDERMAN, J. CHAN, S. FARAONE, L. FEINBERG &
A. POPE. Clinical Correlates of Working Memory Deficits in Youth
with and without ADHD: A Controlled Study.
Objective: The object of this study was to analyze whether the prevalent
Working Memory deficits present in children with ADHD were the 1)
primary cause of the educational deficits documented in this population; 2) whether working memory deficits caused difficulties beyond
academics and 3) whether working memory affects children outside
the context of ADHD.
Participants and Methods: Subjects were youth aged 6-18 of both
sexes with (N = 280) and without (N = 242) ADHD. derived from longitudinal, case-control family studies conducted at the Massachusetts
General Hospital. Assessment included measures of psychiatric, psychosocial, educational, and cognitive functioning. Working memory was
assessed using the WISC-R Freedom from Distractibility (FFD) factor.
We classified subjects as having WM deficits using the following rules:
1) Subjects with a full scale IQ of 120 or less were considered having a
WM deficit if their Freedom from Distractibility (FFD) score was 1 SD
(15 points) lower than their full scale IQ; 2) any subject with a FFD of
<85 and 3) any subject with full IQ >120 with a FFD 1.5 SDs (22.5
points) below their full IQ.
Results: Significantly more youth with ADHD had WM deficits than
controls (31.9% vs. 13.7%, p< 0.05) and in ADHD children, their presence was significantly (p<0.01) associated with an increased risk for
grade retention and placement in special classes as well as lower scores
on reading and math achievement tests, relative to ADHD subjects
without WM deficits. In contrast, no other differences were noted in
other areas of functioning. Although WM deficits also had some adverse
impact on educational and cognitive correlates in non-ADHD controls,
these differences failed to attain statistical significance.
Conclusions: WM deficits significantly and selectively increase the risk
for academic deficits in children with ADHD beyond those conferred by
ADHD. Screening for WM deficit may help identify children with ADHD
at high risk for academic problems.

R. FRIED, J. BIEDERMAN, B. REIMER & G. JOSHI. Examining
Driving Behavior in Young Adults with High Functioning Autism
Spectrum Disorders (HF-ASD): A Pilot Study Using a Driving
SImulation Paradigm.
Objective: A recent survey showed only 24 percent of adults with HFASD who were deemed capable of driving were independent drivers
compared to close to 87 percent of the population as a whole. The main
aim of this study was to examine driving performance in young adults
with HF-ASD in comparison with a community sample to ascertain
reasons why so few individuals with HF-ASD are independent drivers.
Participants and Methods: Subjects were 20 male 18–24 year olds,
half HF-ASD and half who were community controls. The HF-ASD
group met the DSM-IV criteria for ASD, had IQs of 85 or greater, and
valid driver’s license. Subjects drove a 43-mile virtual roadway that
consisting of urban and highway roads. During the simulation, auditory
distracter tasks were introduced. In addition to driving performance,
physiological measures including measurement of eye tracking, skin
conductance and heart rate were collected

46
Results: No differences in speed or lane variability was found between
groups. Mean heart rate and skin conductance measures were higher
in the HF-ASD group than Controls. The average vertical position of
HF-ASD drivers’ gaze was 44 % higher than the community controls
indicating HF-ASD drivers were less oriented toward objects low in the
visual field (i.e. dashboard, brake lights in front of them, and on-coming
vehicles). The HF-ASD group also showed a difference in gaze positioning more to the left with distracter tasks indicating a shift away from
the road with cognitive demand.
Conclusions: These results show differences in both vertical and horizontal gaze in drivers with HF-ASD as well as differences in physiological measures indicative of anxiety. This research provides an indication
of the types of challenges that HF-ASD drivers may encounter and what
technology or treatment might be helpful in alleviating the situation.

R. FRIED, G. JOSHI, J. BIEDERMAN, A. POPE, J. CHAN, P. BHIDE
& S. FARAONE. Neuropsychological Correlates of Autism
Spectrum Disorders: A Controlled Study of Adults with High
Functioning ASD.
Objective: The main of this study was to examine the neuropsychological underpinnings of High Functioning (IQ>80) Autism Spectrum
Disorder (HF-ASD) attending to comorbidity with ADHD. ADHD is
comorbid at a rate of 80% in ASD; thus, we compared the scores on a
range of cognitive/neuropsychological tests of the adults with HF-ASD
to adults with and without ADHD of similar age and sex.
Participants and Methods: Participants included 26 adults with HFASD, 52 adults with ADHD, and 52 Controls. All subjects were administered: the Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence, Processing speed
and Working Memory subtests from the Wechsler Adult Intelligence
Scale-IV, tests of executive functioning from the Delis Kaplan Executive
Functioning System, the Test of Word Reading Efficiency, and the Wide
Range Achievement Test in Math. For continuous outcome variables, a
linear regression model was used; for binary outcome variables, a logistic
regression was used. If the overall test of equality of groups showed that
some groups differed from the others, then pairwise tests were carried
out using Tukey adjustments.
Results: Two subjects from the ADHD and Control groups were
matched to each ASD subject. Since SES was lower in the ASD group,
all subsequent tests corrected for SES. There were no other significant
differences in socio-demographic characteristics between groups. No
differences in IQ were found among the groups. HF-ASD subjects were
significantly more impaired than both comparison groups in processing speed, cognitive flexibility and sight words. HF-ASD subjects were
more impaired than Controls in Working Memory, but not compared
to ADHD subjects.
Conclusions: Our findings reveal very robust neuropsychological deficits in subjects with HF-ASD in comparisons with subjects with ADHD
as well as Controls. The finding of a unique neuropsychological profile
within HF-ASD could have significant implications for identifying individuals at risk for ASD in clinical settings, where the tests utilized in
this study are commonly administered.

O. DEVINSKY & K. BLACKMON. Elevated White Matter
Abnormalities in Females with Autism Spectrum Disorder.
Objective: The male:female ratio in Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD)
is 4:1, indicating increased risk factors in males and/or protective factors in females. Females with ASD are at increased risk for neurologic
comorbidities, including severe, treatment-resistant epilepsy. This suggests that females may require a higher degree of “neurologic burden”
to cross the ASD diagnostic threshold. We tested this hypothesis by

quantitatively comparing white matter abnormalities in males and females with ASD.
Participants and Methods: Our sample included 22 individuals with
ASD (11 males) and 22 age-matched controls (11 males) from the
ABIDE database. Our dependent measure of “neurologic burden” was
derived from the 3T T1-weighted MRI scans from each subject. Scans
were processed with Freesurfer 5.3 to segment the gray and white matter
and calculate the volume of all voxels in the white matter with hypointense signal (WMH). A group (ASD, control) by sex (male, female)
ANCOVA was performed to test for an interaction, after controlling
for total supratentorial brain volume. Autism Diagnostic Observation
Schedule (ADOS) scores were used to test for sex differences in ASD
symptom severity.
Results: There was an interaction between group and sex (F=7.72,
p=0.008): although male controls had higher WMH volumes than female controls (F=6.17, p=0.02), females with ASD trended towards
higher WMH volumes than males with ASD (F=3.64, p=0.07). Within
the ASD group, there were no sex differences in ADOS scores; WMH
volumes and the stereotyped behaviors/restricted interests subscale were
correlated (r=0.44, p=0.04).
Conclusions: Results suggest that although males and females with
ASD did not differ in symptom severity, females carried a higher neurologic burden, as indicated by elevated WMH volumes. Further, WMH
volumes were associated with elevated stereotyped behaviors and restricted interests, implicating an etiological role for these white matter
abnormalities in a core ASD symptom domain.

A. BONEBAKKER. Autism spectrum disorders in dual-diagnosis
patients.
Objective: Objective
The objective of this study was to determine if ASD occurs often in dual-diagnosis patients. Over the course of a year and a half, all inpatients
at the Palier Centrum Dubbele Problematiek in The Hague previously
diagnosed with SUD and a serious mental disorder were screened for
ASDs using a standardised psychological assessment tool.
Background
In recent years Dutch mental healthcare institutions have seen a rise
in the number of cases of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) diagnosed
among normally gifted patients. These patients often suffer from comorbid disorders. Currently little is known about patients with an ASD
and a comorbid Substance Use Disorder (SUD).
Participants and Methods: Participants and method
Dual-diagnosis inpatients were screened using the Autism Spectrum
Quotient and the Autism Spectrum Disorders in Adults Screening Questionnaire. If the results strongly suggested that the patient suffered from
an ASD, he or she was given a (neuro)psychological assessment. A total
of 212 patients were included in the study, of whom 100 were screened.
Six were suspected of having an ASD and were assessed more fully. All
six were found to have an ASD.
Results: Results
The number of ASD patients was similar to that found in another group
that had not been screened but in which seven patients had been diagnosed with ASDs based on full psychological assessments. Both groups
had a number of significant common characteristics.
Furthermore, the results are consistent with a number of other recent
Dutch studies
Conclusions: Conclusion
This study shows that among dual-diagnosis patients at the Palier Centrum Dubbele Problematiek in The Hague, the proportion with an ASD
is at least 5% higher than known prevalence rates. We suspect that there
are still more patients with ASD that are not detected.

K.R. BRADBURY, D.L. ROBINS, M. BARTON & D. FEIN. Birth
Order Impacts Psychometrics on M-CHAT-R with Follow-up
Phone Interview (M-CHAT-R/F).
Objective: The M-CHAT-R/F is a parent-completed, screening instrument to detect autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in toddlers. When
a child screens positive on the initial items, the follow-up confirms
responses and reduces false positives. Previous research suggests that
parents report developmental concerns about their first-born child significantly later than concerns about subsequent children. The current
study proposes to explore how birth order may affect performance on
the M-CHAT-R/F.
Participants and Methods: Toddlers (n=148) were evaluated after
screening positive on the M-CHAT-R/F. Overall result and item performance at initial and follow-up screen were compared for first-born
children (n=58) and subsequent children (n=90). Diagnostic outcome
was also examined.
Results: Samples did not differ on demographic characteristics. Follow-up was conducted approximately 1.5 mos after the M-CHAT-R,
which did not differ between samples. Despite similar diagnostic classification (ASD vs. non-ASD) between groups, first-born children had
lower M-CHAT-R/F scores than subsequent children (p=.027). Item
analysis indicated that subsequent children were more likely to fail items
regarding more subtle behavior, such as following a point. Subsequent
children were also more likely to be evaluated earlier than first-born
children (p=.045).
Conclusions: Parents may complete screening measures, such as the
M-CHAT-R, differently for their first-born children than for subsequent
children. Given similar diagnostic outcomes, differences in performance
may suggest decreased developmental concern for first-born children or
decreased awareness of subtle developmental milestones. The increased
delay to evaluation for first-born children provides further support for
this claim. Additional analysis of evaluation data is warranted and may
provide further insight regarding birth order effects.

4.01, p= 0.0001) and displaying emotional arousal for neutral images
(B= -1.32, t= -2.08, p= 0.04) were the strongest determinants of traits
of autism. Also, identifying positive emotional valence was a trend-level
predictor (B= -0.57, t= -1.79, p= 0.077).
Conclusions: Preliminary findings from the current study may potentially expand our understanding of the role of emotional processes that
are important determinants of autism tendencies in healthy individuals.

A.R. CARLEW & T.D. PARSONS. A Virtual Classroom Continuous
Performance Task for Assessing Persons with Autism.
Objective: Environmental distractors may impair classroom performance in students with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). While some
studies report unimpaired inhibition in persons with autism, studies of
resistance to distractor inhibition tend to reveal difficulties. We used
a Virtual Classroom Continuous Performance Task (VC-CPT; Digital
Media Works) to compare performance of college age students with
ASD to typically developing students in non-distraction and distraction
conditions.
Participants and Methods: Eight college age students diagnosed with
ASD and ten neurotypical college age students were administered the
VC-CPT. Within the VC-CPT, participants were asked to click a mouse
button after viewing the letter “K” followed by the letter “A.” Ecologically valid auditory, visual, and audio-visual distractors were presented
in the environment during the distraction condition.
Results: A 2x2 mixed ANOVA controlling for age revealed a main effect
of group, F(1,15) = 7.79, p = .014, and an interaction of group and condition, F(1,15) = 5.25, p = .037. While there was a significant difference
on an overall performance measure of speed and accuracy regardless
of condition, the addition of distractions impaired performance of the
ASD group significantly more than the control group.
Conclusions: The VR Classroom revealed differences in resistance to
distractor inhibition between individuals with ASD and typically developing individuals. These results indicate individuals with ASD are
more susceptible to disturbance by environmental distractions, which
may impair everyday functioning.

P.A. CABILES, A. CHAPMAN, J. CHO, M. GOODYEAR,
N. KESHAVARZIAN & K. KEE. Is Emotional Processing a
Predictor of Traits of Autism Among University Students?
Objective: Recent studies have demonstrated that healthy individuals
with traits of autism showed impairments in identifying emotional valence. However, little is currently known about other aspects of emotional processing that are critical for adaptive functioning. The current study examined a broad scope of emotional processes (identifying
emotional valence and arousal, emotional awareness, and emotional
creativity) to determine specific predictors of autism traits in 101 university students.
Participants and Methods: Participants’ viewed a series of 60 positive,
neutral, and negative images selected from the International Affective
Picture System, and then identified emotional valence and arousal using the Self-Assessment Manikin. In addition, participants’ emotional
awareness was assessed using the Toronto Alexithymia Scale and emotional creativity was measured using the Emotional Creativity Inventory.
Autism tendencies were assessed using the Autism-Spectrum Quotient.
Results: Traits of autism were regressed on eight emotional processing
predictors (identifying positive emotional valence, neutral valence, and
negative valence; emotional arousal for positive, neutral, and negative
images; alexithymia/emotional awareness; and emotional creativity),
using a simultaneous multiple linear regression procedure. The regression was significant, F(8, 88)= 3.99, p= 0.0001, R-squared = 0.266.

A. CLAWSON, M. SOUTH & M.J. LARSON. Conflict Adaptation in
Autism Spectrum Disorder: A Family Study.
Objective: Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is associated with deficits
in cognitive control processes involved in flexible behavioral regulation.
Relatives of ASD probands often display subthreshold cognitive deficits. Cognitive aspects of behavioral regulation can be measured using
conflict adaptation (CA), modulations in cognitive control based on
previous-trial conflict. We examined response time (RT) and error rate
indices of CA in ASD probands and their father, mother, and non-ASD
sibling relative to control youth and their parents. We hypothesized
that ASD probands would display reduced CA and similar patterns of
reduced CA would be observed in ASD relatives.
Participants and Methods: 18 ASD probands, 49 first-degree relatives, and 75 control families completed a modified Eriksen flanker task.
Mean CA effects were calculated for RTs and error rates. Linear regressions were used to predict mean CA for RTs and error rates with Group
(autism, control), Kinship (mother, father, sibling, proband), and Group
x Kinship interactions as independent variables and families as clusters.
Results: Groups showed reliable CA effects. The model of mean CA
for error rates was significant (F=2.88, p=.02). Group (t=1.05, p=.30),
Kinship (|t|<1.33, p>19), and Group x Kinship interactions (|t|<1.85,
p>.07) did not significantly predict mean CA. The model of mean CA for
RTs was not significant F=.82, p=.58. Group (t=-.06, p=0.57), Kinship

48
(|t|<1.20, p>.24), and Group x Kinship interactions (|t|<1.37, p>.18)
were not significant.
Conclusions: Mean CA for RTs and error rates did not differ between
groups or as a function of family status. Youth with ASD displayed
similar patterns of CA relative to control youth, and siblings and parents
of ASD probands did not display significant differences in CA relative
to control families. Thus, deficits in cognitive control regulation seen in
ASD may not reflect underlying poor adaptation to cognitive conflict
among probands or first-degree relatives.

C. CORDEAUX, M. BARTON & D. FEIN. Profiles of Children Missed
at Initial Autism Screening Compared to Early-Identified Peers.
Objective: This study presents data from a two-year follow-up screening with the M-CHAT and the M-CHAT-R/F examining the profiles of
children first identified and diagnosed at age 48 months in comparison
to earlier-identified peers.
Participants and Methods: Participants were screened at pediatric
well-visits at 18-24 months of age. Approximately 2 years after initial
screening, children were rescreened by mail. Children who screened
positive at 18-24 months and/or 48 months were invited to complete
an evaluation. Some children initially received a non-ASD diagnosis
and later an ASD diagnosis (NA) (N=17); others maintained an ASD
diagnosis (AD) (N=164). Some children who screened negative at 1824 months but positive at 30-48 months received an ASD diagnosis
(LD) (N=27).
Results: At 48 months, groups did not differ by age, gender, or race/
ethnicity. Groups significantly differed on cognitive ability, adaptive
skills, and symptom severity. The LD and NA groups differed from the
AD group on socialization, daily living skills, visual problem solving
ability, and receptive and expressive language ability. The LD and NA
groups differed from each other on adaptive communication and motor
skills. The AD group had consistently weaker cognitive and adaptive
skills and more severe symptoms than both the LD and NA groups.
Conclusions: These findings indicate that a subset of children with
ASD may not present with full symptom profiles or present with lower
intensity symptoms at 18-24 months. These results emphasize the importance of ASD screening at multiple time points as a single screening
may miss cases, or initial diagnosis may change. Understanding profiles
of children who are not diagnosed with ASD until late toddlerhood can
inform best practices for screening in the community and aid in development for ASD-specific screening tools and procedures.

B. DOLAN, A. BARRINGTON, D. SNYDER, A. MCVEY &
A. VAUGHAN VAN HECKE. Examining PEERS for Young Adults:
Improvements in Social Motivation and Relations to Neural
Activity.
Objective: Social skills deficits among adults with ASD lead to isolation
and a lack of friendships. The Program for the Education and Enrichment of Relational Skills for Young Adults (Gantman et al., 2012) is
an empirically based, caregiver-assisted treatment that teaches young
adults with ASD how to make and keep friends. There are no published
studies that have evaluated PEERS for Young Adults and its effects on
brain function. Thus, this study seeks evaluate intervention influences
on brain function, as assessed via EEG, and examine if neural changes
relate to improvements in social functioning and mental health.
Participants and Methods: Analyses included 25 young adults (1826 years old) with ASD. All participants had a verbal IQ > 70 and
diagnoses were confirmed with the ADOS. The intervention was the
16-session PEERS for Young Adults. Measures were taken at pre- and
post-intervention and included: 1) the Social Responsiveness Scale

(caregiver report; SRS: Constantino, 2005); 2) the Beck Depression
Inventory (BDI: Beck, 1987); and 3) a 3-minute continuous, resting
state EEG recording.
Results: For the experimental group, caregivers at post-treatment reported significant improvements in social motivation on the SRS (F(1,
23) = 6.10, p < .05). There was a significant group by time by location
interaction within the beta frequency band (F(1, 23) = 4.16, p < .05),
with the experimental group demonstrating a significant decrease in left
temporal-parietal beta power at post-treatment. This decrease in beta
band activity was related to improvements in social motivation following
PEERS (r = .49, p < .01).
Conclusions: Young adults receiving PEERS demonstrated a significant improvement in caregiver-reported social motivation, and this was
related to a decrease in left temporal-parietal beta power, which research
suggests is indicative of better neural control (Engel & Fries, 2010). The
results from this study add to the minimal literature that has examined
efficacious social skills interventions for adults.

J.M. ELOI. The Contribution of Intelligence, Empathy and
Personality Traits to Adaptive Living Skills in Individuals with
Autism Spectrum Disorder.
Objective: The prevalence of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is estimated at 1 in 68 people in the United States (Klaiman, et al., 2015)
but little is known regarding factors that influence adaptive living skills.
Prior investigations of suggest that intelligence affects future academic
and work success in ASD children. In the current study, we investigate
whether intelligence, empathy or emotional state affect academic/job
achievement, independent living and social success in ASD adults.
Participants and Methods: The sample consisted of 27 adults with
ASD (9 females, 18 males) ranging from age 20 to 51 who underwent
comprehensive assessments in an outpatient cognitive neurology clinic.
All met DSM-V criteria for ASD. Neuropsychological and personality
test data were examined in relation to the Functional Outcome Measure
(FOM). Intelligence was measured with VCI and POI indices from the
Wechsler Adult Intelligence (WAIS-III). Empathy was measured with
the Empathy Quotient (EQ) from the Cambridge Behavioral Scale (Baron-Cohen & Wheelwright, 2004). Emotional state and personality were
assessed with the Personality Assessment Inventory (PAI).
Results: A multiple regression analysis revealed that the POI variable
of the WAIS-III and the NIM, PIM, SOM, ANX, ARD, DEP, MAN, PAR,
SCZ, BOR, ALC, DRG, AGG, NON, RXR and DOM variables of the PAI
were statistically significant and predicted FOM total, F(23,3)=10.210,
p<.0005, R^2=.987. The variables that were most predictive of FOM
total, (p<.05) were PIM, MAN, SCZ, DEP and ANX.
Conclusions: The results indicate that multiple subscales on the PAI
and POI are predictive of FOM total to a varying degree. The SCZ
variable showed a positive relationship with FOM such that as FOM
total increased SCZ increased. The POI, PIM, MAN, DEP and ANX
variables had a negative relationship with FOM total such that as FOM
total increased the POI, PIM, MAN, DEP and ANX decreased. The DEP
variable had the greatest effect on the FOM total.

S. FATOORECHI, J. MURRAY, L. SUMNER & A.E. SIMUN. Atypical
Cerebral Lateralization for Handedness in Autism Spectrum
Disorder.
Objective: Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) has been associated with
atypical patterns of handedness. Other studies have correlated atypical
neurological development and organization with ASD. The current study
sought to examine the lateralization of handedness to determine specific
handedness patterns and neurodevelopmental correlates in ASD.

Forty Fourth Annual INS Meeting Abstracts
Participants and Methods: Archival data was utilized to compare an
ASD group (N=49) to the normative population (N=1,910) provided
by the Wide Range Assessment of Visual Motor Abilities (WRAVMA)
manual. The ASD group was administered the Pegboard Test of the
WRAVMA. A Difference Score was calculated for each participant based
on the relative difference in skill between hands. The subjects’ Difference
Score was calculated as the difference in standard scores between dominant and non-dominant hand. This score was used to determine degree
of lateralization and was compared against the normative population.
Results: A z-test was computed to evaluate whether the relative difference in skill between hands in an ASD group was different from the
normative population. The threshold for significance was set at p<.05.
The ASD group demonstrated less variation in skill between hands when
compared to the normative population. Specifically, 53% of the ASD
group demonstrated equal or near equal skill between hands suggesting
a deficiency in lateralization for handedness.
Conclusions: The current data indicate that individuals with ASD and
individuals with typical neurodevelopment demonstrate significantly
different patterns of handedness. The ASD group demonstrated far less
variation in skill between hands indicating reduced or unestablished
lateralization for handedness. These data suggest that atypical lateralization may play a role in the development of ASD symptomology and
indicate that lateralization assessments may be beneficial as a diagnostic
tool for the early detection of ASD.

R. LAJINESS-O’NEILL. Relationship Between Neural Coherence
and Social Inference and Prediction in Autism Spectrum Disorder.
Objective: Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is characterized by atypical social functioning. Aberrant neural synchrony may underlie this
phenotype, as the gamma band is associated with perceptual binding;
however, it is unclear whether similar associations are seen in complex
language perception. This study explored relationships between synchrony and ability to infer and predict in social scenarios.
Participants and Methods: 12 ASD (Age:M=9.1;SD=1.0) and 13 neurotypical (NT) children (Age:M=9.3;SD=1.3) underwent magnetoencephalography (MEG) at rest. Synchrony was quantified via coherence
between cortical sites in the gamma band. Kendall Tau correlations were
used to examine relationships between coherence and social inference/
predicting.
Results: ASD: enhanced interhemispheric coherence from left middle
temporal to right superior parietal and bilateral precuneus, from left
precuneus and superior occipital to right fronto-temporo-parietal regions, and intrahemispheric coherence from right angular to fronto-parietal regions was related to poor social inference (τ=-0.51- -0.60).
NT: enhanced interhemispheric coherence between left middle/superior temporal and right middle/superior fronto-temporal regions, and
between left inferior/middle frontal gyri and right middle temporal
and angular regions, was related to poor prediction in social scenarios
(τ=-0.52- -0.68).
Conclusions: Results suggest atypical hemispheric specialization for
social inference and prediction in ASD. Increased gamma synchrony
between bilateral parietal and right fronto-temporo-parietal regions
conferred risk for poor social inference. Gamma synchrony appeared
unrelated to prediction. Conversely, in NT, increased interhemispheric
gamma synchrony (temporal to temporo-frontal) conferred risk for poor
prediction, while synchrony was unrelated to social inference. Overall,
enhanced gamma activity in anterior fronto-temporal regions was related to poor prediction in NT and enhanced gamma activity in posterior
parietal regions was related to poor inference in ASD.

J.W. GRIFFIN, B.E. GAVETT & J. SAURMAN. Moderation Analysis
of Episodic Memory in Autism Spectrum Disorders: A MetaAnalytic Review.
Objective: Episodic memory is often reduced in individuals with autism.
The goal of the current analysis was to examine potential moderating
variables across multiple samples examining episodic memory in autism
spectrum disorders. By examining possible moderating variables across
studies, a better understanding of what influences episodic memory in
autism spectrum disorders can be found. It is hypothesized that age
and type of episodic memory assessed will have the most influence on
episodic memory performance in the autistic samples.
Participants and Methods: A search of relevant literature within ‘PsycINFO’ and ‘Scopus’ databases yielded 23 studies meeting inclusion
criteria to be analyzed, for a total of 518 participants with high-functioning autism and 547 age-matched controls. A moderation analysis
was conducted using three moderating variables: gender, age, and type
of episodic memory assessed (source, autobiographical, or episodic) with
autobiographical being very personal.
Results: A random-effects model was used for the meta-analysis, consistent with the significant heterogeneity in the data (Q = 119.58, p <
.05), which indicated that some moderating variables might exist. The
overall effect of autism on episodic memory was d = -1.00, 95% CI
[-1.39, -0.62]. However, the moderation analysis showed no significant
differences across age (b = 0.18, 95% CI [-0.18, 0.52]), gender (b =
7.26, 95% CI [-7.50, 22.02]), or type of episodic memory (b = -12.30,
95% CI [-29.21, 4.62]), suggesting that these variables do not systematically affect memory in autism spectrum disorders.
Conclusions: Contrary to the hypothesis, the moderation analysis
showed that neither age, gender, nor type of episodic memory had a
significant effect on the episodic memory deficits found in autism, indicating that the deficits are very generalizable to multiple groups of
individuals with the disorder. Because the heterogeneity in effect sizes
was not explained by age, gender, or memory type, it may be a function
of other factors, such as genetics.

L. KENWORTHY, C. PUGLIESE, H. POPAL, E. WHITE, A. MARTIN
& G. WALLACE. Real-World Executive Functions in Adults
with Autism Spectrum Disorder: Profiles of Impairment and
Associations with Adaptive Functioning and Co-morbid Anxiety
and Depression.
Objective: Although executive functioning (EF) difficulties are well
documented among children and adolescents with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), little is known about real-world measures of EF among
adults with ASD.
Participants and Methods: This study examined parent-reported EF
problems among 35 adults with ASD without intellectual disability
(31 males; 18-40 years [M=21.55, SD=4.12]; Full Scale IQ 88-133
[M=112.47, SD=11.21]), and how they correlated with adaptive functioning and co-morbid anxiety and depression symptomatology. Research reliable autism diagnosis was confirmed by expert clinical opinion; parent report was gathered on measures of: EF (Behavior Rating
Inventory of Executive Functioning-Adult version [BRIEF-A]), adaptive
behavior (Adaptive Behavior Assessment System-Second Edition) and
internalizing psychopathology (Adult Behavior CheckList).
Results: One-sample t-tests indicated that adults with ASD were impaired on all nine domains measured by the BRIEF-A relative to the
normative mean (ps<.05). Repeated measures ANOVA demonstrated a
variable EF profile in ASD (F=10.20, p<.001) with the most prominent
deficits occurring in flexibility and metacognition. Hierarchical multiple

50
regressions revealed that even after accounting for the influences of age
and IQ, flexibility problems were associated with anxiety-related symptoms while metacognition difficulties were associated with depression
symptoms and impaired adaptive functioning.
Conclusions: Real-world EF problems persist into adulthood and are
strongly associated with both adaptive functioning and co-morbid anxiety and depression symptoms, making EF an important treatment target
among adults with ASD, for whom disproportionally poor outcomes are
a major area of concern.

J. BRENNAN, I. KOVELMAN & S. BOWYER. Altered P3
Neuromagnetic Evoked Response Related to Language Functioning
in Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder.
Objective: Deficits in attention to the admissible arrangement of sounds
in words may contribute to language delays in children with Autism
Spectrum Disorder (ASD). Neuromagnetic evoked responses were measured using magnetoencephalography (MEG) in children with ASD and
matched neurotypicals (NT) to examine differences in their ability to
detect plausible (phonotactically legal, e.g. vimp) and implausible (illegal, e.g. vinp) syllables. An evoked response at ~300ms after the onset
of phonotactically illegal syllables reflects a P3 deflection, an automatic
attention shift to speech, which we hypothesized to be delayed in ASD.
Participants and Methods: 13 ASD (Mean Age = 9.31; Mean IQ =
92) and 13 NT (Mean Age = 9.69; Mean IQ = 114) underwent 148
channel whole head MEG and neuropsychological assessment. Evoked
responses to legal and illegal syllables were measured at 200ms, 250ms,
and 300ms after stimulus onset. Mann-Whitney U and Kendall Tau were
used to examine group differences and relationships with psychometric
data, respectively.
Results: No significant latency differences were noted between groups
while processing legal syllables or with illegal syllables at 200ms and
250ms, although a significant difference was noted at ~300ms (p <
.05), with ASD showing either an earlier or later response. Right frontal
activation was noted in NT, while bilateral frontal activation was noted
in ASD. Longer P3 latencies were related to lower inferential language
functioning (τ = -.63), but higher performance on general language
measures (τ = .50)
Conclusions: The P3 attentional deflection was either early or late in
ASD compared to NT, which may reflect poor habituation or sensitization. The fronto-parietal attention network is believed to underlie
this response, which may be less strongly right lateralized in ASD. This
atypical attention to language was inversely related to two types of language functions, which may suggest distinct ASD subtypes or alterations
in the response that differentially impact language.

C. LEE & J. BO. Poor Motor Functions Relate to Visuomotor
Adaptation in Children with Autism Spectrum Disorders.
Objective: Children with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASDs) often have
significant motor dysfunctions and impaired motor learning. Despite
growing research in ASDs, the underlying mechanisms of motor deficits
remain unclear. The current study aimed to examine the possible link
between motor learning ability in a visuomotor adaptation task and
motor functions assessed by clinical assessments in children with ASDs.
Participants and Methods: Eighteen children with ASDs (age 8 to 12)
and eighteen matched controls completed the Beery–Buktenica Developmental Test of Visual-Motor Integration (VMI) and the Movement
Assessment Battery for Children (MABC-2). Their parents completed
the MABC Checklist and Developmental Coordination Disorder Questionnaire (DCDQ ‘07). All children completed a visuomotor adaptation

task for motor learning efficiency, magnitude, and adaptability on motor
planning (directional error [DE]) and motor control (total movement
time [MT]).
Results: Results revealed that children with ASDs displayed poor
visual-motor integration, motor coordination, manual dexterity, and
balance. Based on parents’ observation, children with ASDs presented
poorer motor skills across all areas compared to the controls. Nevertheless, children with ASDs demonstrated a significant improvement in motor control (MT, p<.001) and greater control learning magnitude (MT,
p<.05), but poor learning in motor planning (DE, p<.05). Correlations
between the adaptation and assessments revealed that greater improvement on MT during adaptation related to poor motor coordination and
poor classroom skills. Greater learning magnitude on DE correlated to
poor performances on all areas of the VMI and MABC.
Conclusions: Children with ASDs demonstrated the ability to learning
motor skills from the motor control perspective. Greater improvement
of motor learning was correlated with poor baseline motor functions.
Facilitating motor control ability may become a new revenue to accommodate poor motor functions among children with ASDs.

E. MOULTON, M. BARTON, D.L. ROBINS & D. FEIN. Cognitive and
Language Functioning of Children Who Lose Their ASD Diagnosis.
Objective: This study compares the cognitive and language functioning
of toddlers who demonstrate highly positive outcomes from an early ASD
diagnosis (optimal progress, OP) to peers with high functioning autism
(HFA) and peers with typical development (TD).
Participants and Methods: Evaluations were conducted at age two
years following positive screening on an autism-specific screener
(MCHAT(-R)).The Mullen Scales of Early Learning, adaptive and diagnostic measures were completed.Diagnosis was based on the clinical
judgment of experienced clinicians.Children were reevaluated at age
four.Three groups of children were included (OP, HFA, TD; N=20
each).Group criteria is as follows. OP: children initially met criteria for
an ASD, no longer meet criteria, and scored in the average range on
standardized measures of cognition, language and adaptive skills.HFA:
children met criteria for an ASD at both evaluations and scored in the
average range cognitively.TD: children never met criteria for any clinical
diagnosis and scored in the average range cognitively and adaptively.
Groups did not differ in age at reevaluation, gender or ethnicity.
Results: ANOVAs indicated no group differences in visual receptive
or receptive language abilities.The OP group demonstrated weaker expressive language skills than TD peers (p=.024).Specifically, the OP
group demonstrated comparable repetition skills and picture vocabulary
knowledge, but weaker oral vocabulary abilities (p=.017).
Conclusions: By age four, children in the OP group are functioning
comparably to TD peers in receptive language, fine motor and visual
reception.Despite demonstrating skills within the average range, these
children continue to demonstrate a relative weakness in expressive
language skills, particularly in the domain of oral (but not picture)
vocabulary. Additional research is needed to determine whether these
differences reflect true differences in vocabulary knowledge, or differences in the ability to attend, formulate a verbal answer, or respond to
purely oral questioning.

A. NADER, V. BOUCHARD, A. BERTONE & I. SOULIÈRES. An
increased role of perception in learning for autistic children.
Objective: Individuals with an autism spectrum disorder (ASD) may
differ from others in how they learn and categorize new information. Not
only ASD individuals perform well on a variety of low-level perceptual
tasks but they also show a propensity to detect patterns and regularities.

Forty Fourth Annual INS Meeting Abstracts
This leads to the hypothesis that modifying the learning situation by
increasing access to the regularities in the stimuli could facilitate concept acquisition for this population. Our aim is to assess how material
presentation influences learning processes in autism.
Participants and Methods: 40 ASD and 40 typically developing (TD)
children (7-13 years; IQ > 80) matched on age and IQ were exposed to
two probabilistic perceptual categorization tasks where the child had
to discover the rule to properly classify stimuli in two categories. The
tasks differed on material presentation. In the sequential condition, 200
different stimuli were presented one at a time, with immediate feedback
(200 trials). In the simultaneous condition, 200 different stimuli were
presented altogether, with feedback after the child sort them into two
categories. Learning was assessed in a testing phase, using the same
stimuli as well as different generalization stimuli.
Results: While similar performance was found in TD children in both
training conditions, there was a better learning rate for the ASD children
when all learning material is presented as a whole (simultaneously) instead of sequentially (53% vs 65%; p<.05). Furthermore, ASD children
generalized better to similar stimuli when they learned in the simultaneous condition (58% vs 66%; p<.05).
Conclusions: ASD children benefit from having access to all the information simultaneously. This suggests that these children learn differently than other children, and may rely on perceptual processes such as
extracting regularities and detecting patterns among the material they
are learning. The present results may modify how learning processes in
autism are understood and impact teaching methods.

L. PAWLUK, R. LAJINESS-O’NEILL & C. SORENSEN. Initiation
of Joint Attention (IJA) and Executive Functioning in School-Aged
Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and Attention
Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD).
Objective: Children with ASD and ADHD often display symptom overlap, as well as executive and social deficits. Initiation of joint attention
(IJA), a core social skill, is impaired in young children with ASD, and
appears to be mediated by the frontal lobes, which are implicated in
both ASD and ADHD. Whereas response to JA improves over time,
little is known about the the course of IJA in ASD, and social research
is generally lacking in ADHD. The current study aimed to compare
aspects of social and executive functioning in these populations in order
to elucidate endophenotypes that may help identify common or unique
symptomatology and underlying neural substrates in these disorders.
Participants and Methods: Participants included 43 children (17
controls [TD], 13 ASD, 13 ADHD), 8-12 years old, who were administered the WASI, DKEFS, WCST, CPT, and ADOS. Parents completed
the Connors’ Parent Rating Scale (CPRS) and Vineland (VABS). The
ADOS was video recorded and coded for IJA behaviors. Given the small
sample size, nonparametric analyses (Kruskal-Wallis, Mann-Whitney)
were conducted to evaluate for group differences.
Results: The ASD group was found to display significantly less IJA behaviors than the TD and ADHD groups, with no significant differences
between the latter groups. Children in both the ASD and ADHD groups
were rated as having more social problems than the TD group on the
CPRS and VABS. There were no significant differences between groups
on executive functioning measures.
Conclusions: While previous research focuses on IJA in early childhood,
current results suggest that children with ASD continue to demonstrate
IJA deficits into middle childhood. While children with ADHD were
rated as experiencing more social issues than TD children, these issues
do not appear to be related to IJA deficits. In fact, given significant
symptom overlap in ASD and ADHD, assessing for IJA behaviors may
be diagnostically beneficial in the clinical setting. Further research is
required to examine neural underpinnings of IJA skills.

A.E. RICHARD, R. LAJINESS-O’NEILL & S. BOWYER. Neural
Synchrony during Visual Attention Shifting in Autism Spectrum
Disorders.
Objective: Children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) do not show
greater dimension-shifting costs than neurotypicals (NT) during visual
search; however, it is unknown whether dimension-shifting is achieved
using abnormal neural mechanisms in ASD. This study investigated
neural synchrony during a visual search task with a dimension-shifting
component in ASD compared to NT, as well as relationships between
neural synchrony and ASD symptomology.
Participants and Methods: 6 ASD (Mage = 10.3) and 11 NT (Mage
= 9.8) completed a visual search task with targets defined in one of two
dimensions while undergoing magnetoencephalography (MEG). Parents
completed a measure of ASD symptomology. Coherence between each
pair of 54 brain regions was calculated for the beta (14-30 Hz) and
gamma (30-80 Hz) frequency bands.
Results: NT showed higher coherence than ASD in frontal-occipital and
occipito-occipital pathways in both beta and gamma frequencies. ASD
showed higher coherence than NT in frontal-parietal, frontal-temporal,
and temporo-temporal pathways in gamma frequencies, and temporal-parietal and temporal-occipital pathways in beta and gamma frequencies. In gamma frequencies, higher coherence in temporal-parietal
pathways was associated with more social communication difficulties,
while higher coherence between orbitofrontal and occipital cortex was
associated with fewer such difficulties. In beta frequencies, higher cingulate-occipital coherence was associated with fewer restricted and repetitive behaviors (RRB).
Conclusions: Results suggest that ASD rely on more widely distributed
neural networks involving temporal cortex to a greater degree than NT
for visual search and dimension shifting, while NT may utilize a more
efficient network relying more heavily on occipital and frontal pathways.
Reliance on this widely distributed network involving temporal cortex
is associated with greater social communication difficulties. Greater
reliance on frontal-occipital pathways is associated with fewer social
communication difficulties and RRBs.

J. STRANG, L. KENWORTHY, L.G. ANTHONY, B. YERYS,
K.K. HARDY & G. WALLACE. The Flexibility Scale: A ParentReport Inventory of Flexibility Skills in Children With Autism
Spectrum Disorders Without ID.
Objective: Restricted, repetitive, behaviors and interests (RRBI) compromise one of two core symptom domains in autism spectrum disorders
(ASD). Existing RRBI measures are limited in their utility to measure
RRBI symptoms dimensionally. The Autism Diagnostic Interview is a
widely used diagnostic evaluation of RRBI symptoms and has been
inappropriately used as a quantitative measure. The Behavior Rating
Inventory of Executive Function provides quantitative measurement
of cognitive and behavioral flexibility, and has consistently identified
flexibility deficits in ASD, but its eight items do not measure possible
subcomponents of cognitive/behavioral flexibility. A novel measure, the
Flexibility Scale (FS) targets broad flexibility characteristics in ASD
using a larger set of items with the goal of increasing power and specificity when describing the inflexibility phenotype in ASD without ID.
Participants and Methods: The original 50-item FS was developed
through an iterative process based on known RRBI/flexibility characteristics in ASD without ID. Parents of 227 children with ASD (age 7-14)
completed the FS. Polychoric exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and
assessments of internal consistency were conducted.

52
Results: Minimum Average Partial and Parallel Analysis tests indicated
best fit with a 5-factor model accounting for 45% of the variance. Items
with factor correlations falling below .4 were eliminated. Ten international ASD/ EF experts evaluated significantly cross-loaded items for
factor placement or removal, and generated descriptions of the factors
based on item set and known ASD flexibility characteristics. The resulting 29-item questionnaire has 5 factors: Routine/Rituals, Transitions/
Change, Special interests, Social flexibility, and Generativity.
Conclusions: These results suggest that RRBI/flexibility characteristics in ASD without ID are multi-dimensional. If confirmed, this factor
structure has important implications for the phenotype of RRBI in ASD
without ID, including intervention development and measurement.

& L.G. ANTHONY. Experience of Parent Burden from Cognitive
Inflexibility in ASD for Poor and Rich Communities.
Objective: Children with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) and children from low SES families are separately reported to have greater
problems with executive functioning (EF) skills (Granader et al., 2014;
Sarsour et al., 2011). However, there is little research on the impact of
the combination of these risk factors, the focus of this report.
Participants and Methods: We compared 24 students with ASD in
Title 1 or priority schools (i.e., schools receiving extra funding due to
academic or financial need) and 47 students with ASD in non-Title 1
schools. Age ranged from 7 to 11 (M= 9.47; SD=1.01) and Verbal IQs
were average (M= 105; SD=17). There were no group differences in
age (t(69) = 0.58, p = ns) or VIQ (t(69) = 1.85, p = .07), although the
later approached significance. Parents completed the BRIEF Shift scale
and rated the degree of burden they experience from these symptoms
(Interference Total).
Results: The two groups were not significantly different on the BRIEF
Shift scale (t(69) = 0.16, p = ns) or the Interference Total (t(69) =
-.44, p = ns) and both exhibited a positive relationship between these
two variables (Title 1: r = .780; non-Title 1: r = .614). Further analysis
indicated that within the Title 1 group, there was a positive relationship
between greater interference and older age (r = .397, p = .055), but not
VIQ (r = .013). In contrast, within the non-Title 1 group there was a
positive relationship between greater interference and higher VIQ (r =
.358, p = .014), but not age (r = .109).
Conclusions: Although the degree of burden caused by cognitive inflexibility is similar, the child’s age has a stronger relationship with
parents’ experience of burden in the Title 1 communities, while VIQ
is more associated with parents’ experience of burden in the non-Title
1 communities. It is possible that parents’ expectations of their child’s
abilities may mediate their experience of feeling burdened by their
child’s cognitive inflexibility and that these expectations are differentially affected by age and VIQ.

Learning Disabilities/Academic Skills
A. CHILD & P.T. CIRINO. A Cognitive Dimensional Approach to
MD, RD, ADHD Comorbidity.
Objective: Reading disability (RD), math disability (MD), and ADHD
are common disorders that frequently co-occur. However, it is not clear
which cognitive factors contribute to comorbidity and which are unique
to one disorder. Using a dimensional approach, we hypothesize that
working memory and processing speed will contribute to the overlap
between reading, math, and attention while phonological awareness

will contribute to the overlap between math and reading. Numerosity
is expected to be solely related to math outcomes.
Participants and Methods: 222 2nd-grade participants from a larger
sample completed phonological awareness (CTOPP Elision), numerosity (Panamath), working memory (WMTB-C), and processing speed
(WJ-III Cross-Out) tasks. Reading and math abilities were assessed
using untimed (WRAT-3 Reading, Arithmetic) and timed (Word Identification Fluency, Math Facts Fluency Assessment) tasks. Teachers
also completed the SWAN ADHD rating scale. Analyses include partial
correlations.
Results: Zero-order correlations of cognitive to academic/attention
variables ranged from |r| = .20 to .43 for math, |r| = .11 to .58 for reading, and |r| = .26 to .37 for attention. Proportion of variance shared between academic and attention variables decreased between 43 and 85%
after controlling for phonological awareness, 44 and 66% for working
memory, 12 and 40% for processing speed, and 5 and 26% for numerosity. Proportion of shared variance decreased between 5 and 56% for
untimed outcomes and 17 and 85% for timed outcomes.
Conclusions: Consistent with prior studies (Robinson, Menchetti, & Torgesen, 2002; Willcutt, Pennington, Olson, Chhabildas, &
Hulslander, 2005), partialling phonological awareness and working
memory reduced the proportion of variance shared between academic
and attention outcomes. Larger reductions were found with timed versus
untimed academic outcomes. No significant reductions were found after
controlling for numerosity and processing speed. These results affirm
and extend our knowledge of shared and unique cognitions underlying
reading, math, and attention.

Contributions of Executive Functions, Math Anxiety, and Parental
Expectations toward Math Achievement.
Objective: While executive functions (EF), math anxiety (MA), and
parental expectations of math achievement (PE) have been shown to
contribute to math achievement individually, no study has comprehensively examined all three factors’ contributions collectively. A model was
proposed which hypothesized that (1) all three factors predict math
outcome, (2) of the three, EF contributes the greatest unique variance
(3) EF’s effect on math is moderated by MA, and (4) MA’s effect on
math is moderated by PE.
Participants and Methods: Participants were sixth graders (N=96,
50% Male, 90% low SES) from an urban public school setting recruited
for a larger algebra intervention study. Math and EF composites were
derived from averaging together several standard measures, while MA
and PE questionnaires were adapted from others used in previous studies (Wigfield & Meece, 1988; Hess et al., 1987). Analyses used multiple
regression with age as a covariate.
Results: The proposed model was significant (R-squared= 27.0%) as
was a strong EF main effect. When EF was removed, a MA main effect
was also significant. Neither of the interactions was significant. Post-hoc
analyses showed that certain items in the PE questionnaire correlated
with math achievement, and the EFxMA interaction was significant
when using only a difficult math measure (algebra posttest) as the outcome variable rather than the math composite (see Ashcraft & Kirk,
2001; Ramirez et al., 2013).
Conclusions: Taken together, the results provide evidence that emotional (i.e., MA) and environmental (i.e., PE) factors may influence
math achievement, but comparatively, cognitive (i.e., EF) factors are
much stronger predictors of math achievement. Development of interventions that target math should take into account all three factors,
though interventions that provide strategies for children with low EF
may offer the greatest payoff.

D. GREENBERG, M.W. LOVETT & M. WOLF. Exploratory Factor
Analyses of Neurocognitive and Reading-Related Factors in
Struggling Readers At Different Ages.
Objective: Research suggests that neurocognitve and reading-related
variables are highly correlated and best represented by fewer factors
in struggling elementary school readers compared to struggling adult
readers. This study examined the degree to which core neurocognitive and reading-related indicators of Reading Comprehension (RC),
Language Comprehension (LC), Word Decoding (WD), Non-Word
Decoding (NWD), Phonological Awareness (PA), and Speed (S), are
reflective of the same underlying constructs across different age groups
of poor readers.
Participants and Methods: The sample included 430 elementary
school students and 584 middle school students diagnosed with dyslexia, and 236 struggling adult readers. Similar measures of RC, LC,
WD, NWD, PA, and S were used across the three age groups. We tested
exploratory factor analysis (EFA) models with 2-6 factors for each age
group to explore the relationship between the measures and identify
the best fitting model.
Results: The best models differed across the age groups, including
the 2-factor model for elementary school students: χ2(76, N = 430) =
632.78, p < .001; CFI = .90; RMSEA = .13; SRMR = .05; the 4-factor
model for middle school students: χ2(51, N = 532) = 126.20, p < .001;
CFI = .98; RMSEA = .05; SRMR = .02; and the 4-factor model for
adults: χ2(51, N = 236) = 86.00, p < .001; CFI = .98; RMSEA = .05;
SRMR = .03.
Conclusions: In conclusion, different models of reading were found to
best represent neurocognitive and reading-related variables across the
three groups of struggling readers. The best fitting EFA was the 2-factor
for the elementary readers and the 4-factor for the middle school and
adult readers. Specifically, these factors appear to follow a trend of
increased differentiation with age. Thus, it appears that the older poor
readers do not share the less-differentiated language and written abilities
of the youngest readers.

H.M. HASLER, S. TORRES, M.G. FULLER, J. STILES,
Y.E. VAUCHER & N. AKSHOOMOFF. Moved to Learn: Movement
Abilities Correlate with Cognition in Preschoolers Born Very
Preterm.
Objective: Children born very preterm (VPT) are at increased risk
of neurodevelopmental difficulties and may have difficulties in motor
functioning, even in the absence of cerebral palsy or known brain injury.
Performance on the Movement ABC-Second Edition (MABC-2) was
used to examine motor performance in young children and how development of motor skills is related to neuropsychological test performance.
Participants and Methods: As part of an ongoing longitudinal study,
healthy children born VPT were selected based on gestational age at
birth ≤ 32 weeks and no history of early brain injury. VPT and FT
children were selected for the study if they obtained WPPSI-IV FSIQ
scores ≥ 85, had no history of serious psychiatric or neurological illness,
and were entering kindergarten within the following six months. The
participants did not differ on the basis of age, sex, or SES (VPT: n=40,
46.5% female, mean age 5.36 years; FT: n=32, 54.5% female, mean
age 5.34 years).
Results: The VPT group performed significantly more poorly on
the MABC-2 Balance measures that required walking on heels raised
(t=-3.40, p=.001), jumping on mats (t=-2.603, p=.011), and one leg
balance (t=-1.89, p=.063), as well as the catching subtest (t=-1.98,

53
p=.063). The VPT group also performed worse on the Beery Visual-Motor Integration test (t=-2.63, p=.011). WPPSI-IV Visual Spatial
and Processing Speed scores were significantly correlated with MABC-2
Balance scores (t=-.220, p=.058 & t=.342, p=.003).
Conclusions: In this study, we demonstrated that this group of VPT
preschoolers performed worse on balance-related skills compared to
FT controls. These skills are related to neuropsychological domains
of visual spatial skills and processing speed, two domains important
for learning complex skills necessary to succeed in formal schooling.
Therefore, movement ability in preschool may help predict development
of important cognitive skills as children enter kindergarten.

G. LEONARD. Simple and Complex Motor Coordination Abilities
in Children with Dyslexia and/or Attention Deficit Disorder.
Objective: Dyslexia and Attention deficit disorder (ADD) are heterogeneous disorders associated with a variety of cognitive impairments and
with motor skill deficits. However, findings on motor skills are highly
inconsistent because of the wide variety of tools used to measure different types of motor abilities. In addition, few studies have compared
these disorders on motor functioning. The purpose of this study was to
examine simple to complex motor skills including sequential and coordination skills, using the Leonard Tapping Task (LTT) in children and
adolescents with dyslexia, ADD or with both disorders.
Participants and Methods: We studied three groups (N= 27 each)
of children with a diagnosis of dyslexia (DYS: 16 males; MAge = 13.8
SD=2.4), ADD (ADD: 20 males; MAge=12.6 SD=2.2) or both disorders
(COMB: 19 males; MAge=12.6 SD=2.6). Each experimental group was
matched to a control group (Respectively: C1;C2;C3) on age, gender,
IQ and handedness. Reading and writing abilities (WIAT-II), behavioral
questionnaires (Conners-3), dexterity (Grooved Pegboard) and simple
to complex sequential motor coordination (LTT) were measured.
Results: Repeated measures ANOVAs revealed that the three experimental groups performed significantly worse than their matched control group on the Unimanual Sequential (DYSvs.C1: p=0.026;ADDvs.
C2: p<0.001;COMBvs.C3: p=0.005), Bimanual In-Phase (DYSvs.C1:
p=0.007; ADDvs.C2: p<0.001; COMBvs.C3: p=0.029) and Bimanual
Out-of-phase (DYSvs.C1: p=0.002; ADDvs.C2: p<0.001; COMBvs.C3:
p=0.018) conditions on the LTT. No significant differences were shown
on the Simple Rapid Repetitive condition. On the Grooved Pegboard,
the ADD group was significantly slower than their matched C3 group
(p=0.003).
Conclusions: Children and adolescents with dyslexia and/or ADD are
not as well coordinated as their typically developing peers on complex
sequential motor skill measures. Early detection of motor development
could be beneficial in improving the educational trajectories of children
with these disorders.

M. OLIVERI, G. KOCH, S. VICARI & D. MENGHINI. Reading
Improvement Following tDCS and Cognitive Treatment in
Children and Adolescents with Dyslexia.
Objective: Developmental dyslexia is a persistent difficulty in learning
to read. There is evidence that non-invasive brain stimulation transitorily modulates reading of adult expert readers and dyslexics by facilitating the neural pathways underactive in dyslexics. To date no study
evaluated the efficacy of non-invasive brain stimulation in improving
reading of young populations with dyslexia. However, it is critical to
remediate reading problems especially during developmental ages. The
study was aimed at investigating whether transcranial direct current

54
stimulation (tDCS) over parieto-temporal areas enhances reading abilities of children and adolescents with dyslexia and whether the effect
is long-lasting.
Participants and Methods: Eighteen children and adolescents with
dyslexia received 18 sessions of left anodal/right cathodal tDCS, set at
1 mA and lasting 20 minutes, over parieto-temporal regions combined
with a cognitive training. Participants were randomly assigned to active
or sham treatment; reading measures (text, high and low frequency
words, non-words) were collected before (T0) and after treatment (six
weeks later, T1) and in a follow-up evaluation (one month after the end
of treatment, T2). The tolerability of tDCS was also evaluated.
Results: Active group improved low frequency words reading (reading
accuracy) immediately after treatment (T1 vs T0: p = 0.03) and one
month later (T2 vs T0: p = 0.007), and non-words reading (reading
times) immediately after treatment (T1 vs T0: p < 0.001) and one
month later (T2 vs T0: p < 0.001). In the sham group, no difference
emerged in reading after treatment compared to baseline. None of participants reported any discomfort or serious adverse effect.
Conclusions: The study shows preliminary evidence of tDCS feasibility and efficacy in improving reading of dyslexic children and adolescents and it opens new rehabilitative perspectives for the remediation
of dyslexia.

Rapid Automatized Naming Speed Predicts Reading
Comprehension in Impaired and Typical Readers.
Objective: The double deficit hypothesis posits that reading impairment
results from a deficit in either phonological awareness (PA) or rapid
automatized naming speed (RAN), with the most severe impairments resulting from deficits in both, a double deficit. RAN– the ability to quickly
name stimuli– predicts fluent reading. We investigated whether RAN
predicts reading comprehension in impaired and non-impaired readers.
Participants and Methods: Participants were 20 children with reading
disability (RD) and 19 healthy control (HC) children (7-13 years).
RAN was assessed with Comprehensive Test of Phonological Processing digit, letter, object, and color naming subtests. PA was assessed
with letter-word identification and word attack subtests of the Woodcock-Johnson Test of Achievement. Comprehension was assessed with
the Gates-MacGinitie (GMRT) and Gray Oral Reading Tests (GORT).
We tested first whether children with RD differed from HC children
on RAN and comprehension. Next we assessed across all the children
whether RAN predicted comprehension controlling for PA.
Results: We detected a significant main effect of group for RAN (digit
naming, p < .005; letter naming, p < .005) and reading comprehension (GMRT, p < .001; GORT, p < .001), such that children with RD
performed more poorly than HC children. Across all children, RAN
predicted reading comprehension controlling for PA (GMRT, p < .001;
GORT, p < .001). PA explained significant variance in comprehension
(GMRT, p < .001; GORT, p < .001).
Conclusions: Children with RD performed more poorly than HCs on
RAN and comprehension. Consistent with the double deficit hypothesis,
RAN predicted unique variance in comprehension, above and beyond
variance explained by phonological awareness, across all children. These
data suggest that RAN is distinct from PA and is an essential component
of fluent reading across ability levels.

E. RIGGALL, S. FROST, R. SEVCIK & R. MORRIS. Implicit
Sequence Learning and Memory and Phonological Awareness in
Developmental Dyslexia and Specific Language Impairment.
Objective: The present study examined implicit sequence learning
and memory, measured by the widely-used Serial Reaction Time Task
(SRTT), on deficits in grammar and phonological awareness in children who met criteria for Developmental Dyslexia (DD) with or without

Specific Language Impairment (SLI). Implicit sequence learning, a type
of procedural learning, is known be a deficit in both DD and SLI (Menghini et al., 2006; Lum et al., 2010). Though impairments as measured
by the SRTT remain controversial, with both positive and negative
findings, implicit sequence learning is thought to be related to grammatical understanding across SLI and typically developing children
(Lum, 2012). Importantly, such a relationship remains unexamined
among children with DD.
Participants and Methods: Following Tomblin (2007), this study examined the relationship between implicit sequence learning and grammar skills in a sample of elementary school aged poor readers (N=50,
ages 9-10 and 12-14) who met criteria for DD or DD+SLI. Because
children also learn implicitly that words are composed of phonemic
patterns much in the same way they learn about patterns underlying
grammar, the study also examined whether implicit sequence learning
was similarly related to deficits in phonological awareness in these two
groups using the same methods.
Results: Growth curve analyses of learning patterns within the SRTT
were used to further investigate simple group differences and to replicate previous observations of the relationship between implicit sequence
learning and grammar. The same technique was also used to investigate
whether phonological awareness is similarly correlated with implicit
sequence learning.
Conclusions: Results are discussed in terms of the contribution of dimensional analyses over diagnostically categorical analyses of implicit
sequence learning to enrich our understanding of aspects of language
and reading impairments.

Age Moderates the Predictive Utility of Spatial Working Memory
for Mathematical Achievement.
Objective: The role of executive functioning and visuospatial abilities
in mathematics has long been researched in school-age children, but
the specificity and utility of these skills for predicting future outcomes
remains uncertain.The current study adopted a longitudinal approach
to investigate how working memory and visuospatial ability relate to
future mathematical achievement.
Participants and Methods: 25 healthy children aged 7-18 years participated in cognitive and achievement testing during an initial session
and at a 3-year follow-up. Standard scores from the mathematics subtest of the Wechsler Individual Achievement Test - II were used as the
outcome measure. Visuospatial ability was measured by scores from
the matrix reasoning subtest of the Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence. To assess working memory, children completed modified,
computerized n-back and recognition span tasks that required storage
of the content or spatial location of visually presented information.
Hierarchical linear regressions were used to determine the variance in
math achievement at follow up predicted by initial age, visuospatial
ability, working memory, and the age interactions.
Results: Results indicate that visuospatial ability significantly predicts
future math achievement above and beyond age (p<0.05). There was
no significant interaction between age and visuospatial ability. Although
none of the working memory measures were significant, unique predictors of future achievement, there were significant interactions between
age and the spatial working memory tasks (p<0.05), indicating that
spatial working memory is more predictive of future math achievement
when assessed at older ages.
Conclusions: Our findings suggest that while visuospatial ability
may be a useful predictor of math achievement across all ages, spatial working memory skills may have more predictive utility for older
children. Future studies should combine greater data collection and
advanced growth curve modeling to better predict academic achievement outcomes.

The Relationship between Phonological Short-Term Memory,
Working Memory, and Changes in Reading Scores in Children
with Dyslexia.
Objective: This study aimed to understand the role of domain-general
working memory (WM) in predicting post intervention reading scores in
children with Developmental Dyslexia (DD). While reading research has
found that phonological short term memory (STM), measured by nonword repetition (NWR), is a potential predictor of changes in reading
scores from pre to post intervention in individuals with DD (SmithSpark & Fisk, 2007), it remains unclear if a more domain-general component of WM is driving this relationship.
Participants and Methods: Three domain-general WM tasks, Counting Span, Digit Span Backwards and Corsi Blocks Backwards, and a
test of phonological STM, NWR, were given to two groups of children
with DD who participated in an empirically backed reading intervention
program (Lovett et al., 2000) (n = 30 for grades 3-4, mean age 8.95
(SD = .72); n=20 for grades 7-8, mean age 13.13 (SD = .81).
Results: A hierarchical regression showed that without domain-general
tests of WM in the model, the phonological STM task (NWR) did not
significantly predict reading score changes in either age group. In both
age groups Digit Span and Corsi Blocks were significant predictors of
reading score changes, with stronger relationships between variables
seen in the younger sample.
Conclusions: The present results point to an important relationship between domain-general WM skills and phonological STM abilities in DD
children who respond best to empirical reading intervention programs.

R. WISEHEART, K. SUNG, B. JONES, S. SAMUEL & D. JOSE. How
Derivational Morphology Intervention Improves Reading in Adult
English Language Learners.
Objective: Morphological awareness (MA) predicts reading comprehension in English language learners (ELLs), but the nature of the relationship is unclear. Previous research suggests that words are processed
faster when they contain morphological units which in turn improves
reading comprehension. To examine this hypothesis more closely, we
explored the effects of MA intervention on reading fluency and comprehension in ELLs using a multiple baseline single subject design.
Participants and Methods: Twelve ELLs age 21-29 participated
non-concurrently in 6 weeks of MA training. Intervention focused on
structural analysis of words with derivational morphology and included
a repeated timed reading component. Generalization probes for reading
untrained multi-morphemic words were charted and pre- and post-test
measures of reading fluency and comprehension were administered.
Participants completed pre-treatment language history questionnaires
and a battery of cognitive, language, and reading tests.
Results: All participants improved reading fluency of trained words.
Generalization effects to untrained multi-morphemic words were modest (d=.32); however, the average trend line followed a polynomial
u-shaped curve (R2=.83) suggesting that simple processes of soundby-sound phonemic decoding were rapidly replaced by more complex
processes of morphological decoding as a direct result of MA training.
There was a very large effect size of treatment on post-test measures of
reading comprehension (d=1.86). Predictors of post-treatment comprehension included bottom-up processes: reading rate, accuracy, and orthographic knowledge (r=.66-.73); whereas associations with top-down
processes such as English vocabulary and self-rated English proficiency
were non-significant.

55
Conclusions: Our findings show that MA supports ELL’s reading comprehension via reading fluency and demonstrates that structural analysis
treatment can quickly and significantly improve MA.

M.J. WILSON & J. VASSILEVA. Effects of Sex and Drug Class
on Neurocognitive Impulsivity Among Drug Users in Protracted
Abstinence.
Objective: Previous research indicates that active female drug users
show more severe neurocognitive impairments than active male drug
users. To evaluate whether these sex differences are present following
protracted abstinence from drug use, neurocognitive tasks of impulsive choice and impulsive action were administered to male and female
heroin users [HU], amphetamine users [AU], and polysubstance users
[PU]) with >1 year abstinence from DSM-IV substance dependence.
Drug users were compared to healthy controls matched on estimated
IQ (Raven’s Progressive Matrices) and education.
Participants and Methods: Participants (male = 252; female = 85)
completed tasks of impulsive action (Go/No-go Task [GNGT]; Immediate Memory Task [IMT]) and impulsive choice (Cambridge Gambling
Task [CGT]; Iowa Gambling Task [IGT]). Effects of sex and drug class
on neurocognitive performance were analyzed via ANCOVAs.
Results: Sex differences were observed across tasks of impulsive action and impulsive choice. Female HU showed selectively impaired
discrimination (d’) and low correct detections on the IMT. Collapsing
across groups, females demonstrated poor d’ and high omission errors
on the GNGT. On tasks of impulsive choice, females engaged in risky
decision-making when contingencies were ambiguous (IGT) and disadvantageously risk-averse decision-making when contingencies were
explicit (CGT), with post-hoc analyses indicating that these effects were
driven by female PU.
Conclusions: Relative to male drug users and healthy controls, female
drug users in protracted abstinence demonstrated evidence of reduced
sustained attention and stimulus discrimination (impulsive action), and
dysregulated reward-based decision-making (impulsive choice). Different classes of prior injection drug use were associated with distinct
neurocognitive impairments. Specifically, impulsive action deficits were
driven by female HU, while impulsive choice deficits were observed
primarily among female PU. Supported by NIDA/NIH Fogarty International Center R01DA021421 (JV).

Genetics/Genetic Disorders
Y.R. CUKIER & S. SCHAFFER. The Neuropsychological Profile
of a Child with Diamond-Blackfan Anemia and the Impact of
Hemoglobin Level on Aspects of Cognition.
Objective: Diamond-Blackfan Anemia (DBA) is a rare ribosomopathy
characterized by erythroid hypoplasia, congenital anomalies, and increased cancer risk. In some cases, regular transfusions are required in
order to maintain adequate hemoglobin levels. Although research into
the pathophysiology of DBA has grown in recent years, knowledge of
cognitive functioning in this population is scarce. Thus, the primary
aim of the current study was to report the neuropsychological profile of
a child with DBA, with a secondary aim of determining the impact of
hemoglobin level on aspects of cognition.

56
Participants and Methods: An 8-year old Caucasian male with a diagnosis of DBA was referred for neuropsychological evaluation due to
reported inattention and academic failure. He was diagnosed with DBA
at 6 weeks of age, and he has since been primarily transfusion-dependent. In addition to completing a comprehensive assessment, several
measures were administered prior to and following his transfusion for
the purpose of comparison.
Results: Results showed average intelligence with weaknesses in attention, processing speed, and executive functioning. Academic skills
were deficient, with a particular weakness in decoding. Behavioral,
emotional, and social difficulties were identified. Regarding changes
observed between sessions, results showed that while processing speed
and basic attention improved, aspects of executive functioning significantly worsened.
Conclusions: This is the first published case of neurocognitive functioning in DBA and the first to examine the impact of hemoglobin level on
cognition in a child with DBA. Identifying patterns of cognitive development is critical in improving our understanding of this chronic illness
and its impact on psychosocial well-being. Furthermore, knowledge of
the cognitive patterns within this population can help guide treatment
recommendations, including social, behavioral, and academic interventions, with the goal of improving overall quality of life.

Language and Speech Functions/Aphasia
M. VEGA, K. RAGHUBAR, A.M. CARSON, J. OGHALAI &
S. CAUDLE. Comparison of Nonverbal Skills in Children with
Hearing Loss and Autism Spectrum Disorder.
Objective: Measures that assess nonverbal IQ and visual processing, are
useful for evaluating and monitoring patients with a high prevalence
of language problems, such as Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and
bilateral sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL). However, it is unclear if
there are differences in nonverbal processing inherent to these diagnoses.
The purpose of this study is to compare the performance of children
with ASD and SNHL on the Leiter International Performance Scales
Revised and 3rd Edition.
Participants and Methods: Data was obtained via chart review for 39
patients with ASD and 38 patients with SNHL. Patients were aged 3-14
years and had nonverbal IQs of 71-129. Scores from 3 subtests (Figure
Ground [FG], Form Completion [FC], and Sequential Order [SO]) were
compared within and between groups to determine differences.
Results: Although children with ASD and SNHL performed similarly
on all three subtests of the Leiter-R/Leiter-3 (all p-values > .077),
strengths and weaknesses emerged for each group. Paired t-tests revealed that children with ASD showed strength in FC compared to
FG (p = .012) and SO (p < .001). SO emerged as an area of weakness
given that decreased performance was noted relative to FG (p = .008).
In comparison, children with SNHL showed strength in FC, with higher
scores compared to FG (p < .001) and SO, (p < .001), which did not
differ from each other.
Conclusions: Results suggest that differences exist for development of
specific nonverbal cognitive skills for these two diagnostic groups. Although both groups showed a significant strength for FC, SO (requiring
sequencing ability and problem-solving skills) emerged as a significant
weakness for those with ASD. Both groups showed difficulty with FG
(ambiguous stimuli) in comparison to FC. These findings have implications for theories regarding cognitive development in these two groups
as well as treatment approaches for language development.

Symposium 1. Malformations of Cortical
Development and Cognition
Chair: Karen Blackmon

9:15–10:45 a.m.
K. BLACKMON, A.M. GALABURDA, R.C. SCOTT, B. KORMAN
& B.S. CHANG. Malformations of Cortical Development and
Cognition.
Symposium Description: “Malformations of cortical development”
(MCD) is an umbrella term that covers a wide spectrum of cellular and
cytoarchitectonic abnormalities. MCDs can range from large, visually
apparent lesions such as Periventricular Nodular Heterotopia (PNH) to
small, visually elusive lesions such as Focal Cortical Dysplasia (FCD).
MCDs are associated with epilepsy, autism spectrum disorder, and
learning disorders. The mechanisms by which MCDs impact functional
networks underlying cognition and behavior are largely unknown but
exciting advances in genetics, animal modeling, and human neuroimaging are shedding light on the complex relationship between cortical pathogenesis and neurobehavioral dysfunction. This symposium
will survey such progress and introduce promising new therapies for
MCD-associated cognitive disorders. Dr. Karen Blackmon will provide
an overview of cortical development and discuss how failures in neuronal
proliferation, migration, and maturation can lead to structural malformations. She will present data from individuals with genetic mutations
in the 16p11.2 region to introduce a novel neuroimaging method for
mapping neurobehavioral symptoms to focal morphometric abnormalities. Dr. Albert M. Galaburda will present rodent work showing a range
of cortical anomalies that could explain learning deficits. Dr. Rod C.
Scott will discuss data from animal models to show that FCD lesions
have a direct impact on cognitive dysfunction, independent from seizures, and that early enrichment might rescue cognitive deficits. Dr.
Brandon Korman will present human data from a pediatric epilepsy
sample to demonstrate the relationship between FCD lesion extent, type,
and location on cognitive functions and introduce an fMRI method for
studying language network reorganization in FCD. Finally, Dr. Bernard
Chang will discuss an intriguing new therapeutic approach to modulating aberrant network activity in PNH.

K. BLACKMON. Focal cortical anomalies and neuropsychological
phenotypes in 16p11.2 syndrome.
OBJECTIVE: Individuals with genetic mutations in the 16p11.2 region
are at increased risk for intellectual disability, autism spectrum disorder
(ASD), and epilepsy. 16p11.2 deletions are associated with overproliferation of neuronal progenitor cells and macrocephaly. It is unknown
whether focal cortical anomalies are also present. This study will present
a novel neuroimaging method for detecting focal morphometric anomalies in 16p11.2 deletion syndrome and determine whether they are
associated with decreased cognitive ability and increased ASD traits.
PARTICIPANTS AND METHODS: Individuals with 16p11.2 deletions from the Simons VIP database were compared to an age-matched
normative sample using a case-control approach. High-resolution T1weighted MRI scans from each subject were processed with Freesurfer
5.3 and customized scripts. Cortical surface maps from each case were
compared to the normative sample, resulting in a z-score for cortical
thickness (CT) at every vertex. The surface area of all abnormal clusters
(z-score > 2) was summed for each individual and compared between
the 16p11.2 and control group. Rank-order correlations were performed
to determine the relationship between abnormal cluster extent, FullScale IQ, and ASD symptoms.
RESULTS: Individuals with 16p11.2 deletions showed a larger extent of
abnormal CT clusters than controls. A greater extent of focal CT abnormalities was associated with lower Full-Scale IQ and higher ASD traits.

Forty Fourth Annual INS Meeting Abstracts
CONCLUSIONS: Results demonstrate that focal cortical anomalies are
present in 16p11.2 deletion syndrome and associated with increased risk
of intellectual disability or ASD. Given the neuroanatomical heterogeneity of abnormal clusters in the 16p11.2 group, whole-brain averaging of
morphologic measures such as CT might mask group differences; therefore, case-control approaches should be utilized in syndromes where
focal cortical anomalies are suspected.

A.M. GALABURDA. Do minor cortical anomalies need to look like
minor cortical anomalies to produce learning problems? Lessons
from rodent studies.
OBJECTIVE: Based on findings in dyslexic brains at autopsy, various
rodent models have been developed to look at items such as cortical
architecture and connectivity, as well as cortical physiology and behavior. Depending on the type of rodent model a range of minor cortical
malformations can be seen, with and without visible anatomical changes
in cortical and subcortical structures. The main objective of this presentation is to make researchers and clinicians aware of the range of
cortical changes associated with learning deficits.
PARTICIPANTS AND METHODS: During our research, we have looked
at strains of mice with spontaneous cortical malformations, rats with
freezing neonatal cortical lesions, rats exposed to in utero electroporation
of shRNA plasmid directed at dyslexia risk genes, and mice knocked-out
for dyslexia risk genes. Anatomical, cellular, physiological, and behavioral observations are made.
RESULTS: We have observed small layer 1 heterotopias, microgyria,
subcortical heterotopias with cell autonomous and non-cell autonomous
changes, neurons subtly displaced in cortical layers, cortical hyperexcitability, and secondary changes in thalamus and brainstem, and, in
one case, frank hydrocephaly.
CONCLUSIONS: The developing cerebral cortex has a limited range of
responses to early insults, whether genetically or epigenetically acquired.
Where along this range a response will occur in an individual case can
be explained in some situations but not in others.

R.C. SCOTT. Can early environmental enrichment improve
cognitive functions in MCD?
OBJECTIVE: To discuss animal models of MCD, mechanisms of
cognitive impairment and improvements as a function of behavioral
intervention.
PARTICIPANTS AND METHODS: There are several animal models
of MCD described. These include models of both focal and generalized
malformations. Most models are either genetic (e.g. DCX, LIS1) or a result of an intrauterine environmental insult (e.g. methylazoxymethanol
(MAM), x-ray irradiation). Behavioral testing using the Morris Water
maze, place avoidance task and DNMS task was performed in the MAM
model. In addition, in-vivo electrophysiology in awake behaving animals
was performed. Postweaning environmental enrichment and overlearning strategies were used to establish whether behavioral performance can
be improved even in the context of markedly abnormal brain structure.
RESULTS: MAM exposed rats have impairments in spatial cognition
and in attention. These are associated with changes in hippocampal
oscillatory activity in the theta and high gamma frequencies. They also
have abnormalities in place cell parameters in that the cells are of lower
fidelity and less likely to be modulated by background theta oscillations.
Enrichment and overtraining dramatically improve cognitive behavior.
Enrichment is associated with enlargement of posterior hippocampus as
well as partial restoration of oscillatory and single neuron firing activity.
CONCLUSIONS: Malformations of cortical development unsurprisingly
are associated with cognitive impairments. The system-level impact
of the MCD on neural firing activity is increasingly being understood.

57
Modification of cognition with environmental and educational interventions is possible even in the context of a fixed abnormal structural
network.

B. KORMAN. Factors that influence neuropsychological
performance in children with FCD-associated intractable epilepsy.
OBJECTIVE: Presentation of factors that influence neuropsychological
performance in children with intractable epilepsy due to FCD.
PARTICIPANTS AND METHODS: Subjects were pediatric epilepsy
patients who underwent surgical resection and had histologically verified FCD. Neuropsychological evaluation and fMRI language mapping
were done prior to surgery. The effects of histopathology and various
clinical factors on general cognitive functioning, IQ, and language were
evaluated. Language networks were mapped to determine the effects
of histology on activation patterns. Memory processes were compared
between temporal FCD with and without concomitant hippocampal
sclerosis.
RESULTS: Poor cognitive outcomes were significantly associated with
early age at onset of epilepsy and more widespread involvement of
dysplastic cortex. Atypical organization of eloquent language areas was
more likely for receptive than expressive networks, and particularly influenced by lesions in the dominant temporal lobe. There was no direct
relationship to histopathology of FCD or other clinical factors. Despite
no gross memory differences between temporal neocortical FCD and
pathology involving both mesial temporal and neocortex, the additional
hippocampal pathology is associated with worse encoding than solitary
FCD of the neocortex.
CONCLUSIONS: FCD histopathology is not a significant influence on
cognition. However, critical periods of development are disrupted linearly in relation to onset age, while multilobar dysplasias are likely to
have diminished cognitive skills regardless of onset age, without significant interaction effects. Atypical language activation in epileptic children with FCD suggests proximity of pathology to dominant hemisphere
critical cortex as the primary determinant of functional reorganization.
Memory skills encompass multiple processes that may be disrupted at
various points along the larger network and may provide clues regarding
the location of temporal pathology.

OBJECTIVE: Periventricular nodular heterotopia (PNH) is a malformation of cortical development characterized by misplaced nodules of gray
matter lining the lateral ventricles of the brain. Classic bilateral PNH
often presents with seizures and reading disability. Past studies suggest
that aberrant connectivity between the heterotopic nodules and cerebral
cortex is associated with the epileptic state in PNH. We sought to determine whether transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), when applied
to cortical targets identified by connectivity imaging, could modulate
brain function and reduce seizures in PNH.
PARTICIPANTS AND METHODS: Patients with epilepsy from PNH
were studied using TMS and simultaneous electroencephalography
(EEG) recordings. Single-pulse TMS was used to probe the local excitability of cortical regions shown to have resting-state functional connectivity to heterotopia. Repetitive TMS was applied to determine if
cortical excitability and clinical seizure frequency could be reduced
using low-frequency stimulation.
RESULTS: As previously described, heterotopia patients with active epilepsy demonstrated an augmented late cortical response to single-pulse
TMS, and this abnormality was specific to regions with aberrant connectivity. In one participant with refractory epilepsy, low-frequency

58
repetitive TMS to an aberrantly connected cortical target resulted in a
delayed but notable decrease in clinical seizure frequency.
CONCLUSIONS: Accumulating evidence suggests that abnormalities
of brain connectivity underlie the major neurological manifestations of
PNH. Noninvasive brain stimulation, when guided by functional connectivity imaging findings, can both probe and modulate cortical function in a directed manner. Our work demonstrates that such stimulation
methods may be a useful investigative tool and raises the possibility of
potential therapeutic intervention in patients with cortical malformations and brain connectivity defects.

Symposium 2. Neuropsychology and Neuroimaging
in Alcohol Use Disorders:
A Better Understanding for a Better Treatment

in Alcohol Use Disorders: a Better Understanding for a Better
Treatment.
Symposium Description: Alcohol Use Disorders (AUD) are major
worldwide health and socioeconomic concerns. The goal of the symposium is to highlight how the recent advances in our understanding
of alcohol-related neuropsychological impairments and brain damage
improved the treatment of patients with AUD.
There are four keynote speakers. Prof. Edith V. Sullivan from Stanford
University (US) will address the problematic of brain structural and
functional compromise associated with AUD as well as to identify factors
that contribute to compromise, and assess the potential for recovery.
Prof. Hélène Beaunieux from Inserm-Université de Caen Normandie
(France) will speak to the validation of a cognitive screening tool especially designed to detect AUD patients with neuropsychological deficits
that could limit the benefit of treatment and the patients’ ability to
respect their therapeutic contract. Prof. Pierre Maurage from Université
Catholique de Louvain (Belgium) will present data on the emotional
and social abilities that are largely impaired in patients with AUD and
how, potentially, they result in interpersonal difficulties as well as the
development and persistence of the addictive state. Finally, Prof. Marsha
E. Bates from Center of Alcohol Studies, Rutgers University (US), will
overview the development of novel AUD interventions (which involve
cognitive remediation) that match individual trajectories of cognitive
recovery.
As a chair and discussant, I will emphasize the significance of neuropsychological and neuroimaging approaches to patients with AUD.
I will propose adjustments of treatment timing and procedures that
could favor a decrease in alcohol consumption and even abstinence.
Given the number of remaining unknowns, I will conclude by pointing
out avenues to be explored in priority in order to enrich our knowledge
of the pathophysiology and treatment of AUD to ameliorate outcome.

study revealed selective deficits in working memory and balance that
in longitudinal study showed some recovery with sustained sobriety.
MRI revealed that neural substrates of deficits involved frontocerebellar
and limbic circuits. DTI showed degradation of anterior, superior white
matter fiber systems with relative sparing of posterior, inferior systems
that may underlie recovery or escape of function. Longitudinal study
with DTI showed graded improvement with sobriety in men and women
with AUD and confirmation of focal fiber degradation and recovery with
an animal model of binge drinking. Factors associated with compromise
and recovery of brain structure and function included amount drunk
between imaging sessions and nutritional status, notably, of thiamine
levels and macrocytic anemia. Brain structure and function are marked
by substantial heterogeneity in their response to chronic alcohol consumption and in recovery with sobriety. Recognition of the constellation
of factors marking the untoward effects of AUD and those contributing
to improvement could help in treatment by enhancing and perhaps
accelerating recovery. (Support: AA010723, AA017168, AA017923,

H. BEAUNIEUX, L. RITZ, C. LANNUZEL, C. BOUDEHENT,
F. EUSTACHE, F. VABRET & A. PITEL. Cognitive Screening for
a Better Treatment.
Alcohol-related neuropsychological impairments affect episodic memory, working memory and visuospatial abilities, as well as executive and
motor functioning. These impairments can prevent patients with alcohol
use disorders (AUD) from benefiting fully from treatment, and reduce
their ability to remain abstinent. A neuropsychological assessment seems
essential for making the relevant clinical decisions. However, few alcohol
treatment departments have the resources needed to conduct an extensive neuropsychological examination of each alcoholic patient. Brief
screening tools can provide a cognitive and motor profile that can guide
the adjustment of alcohol treatment and further cognitive assessments.
However, current screening tools do not have a satisfactory level of
content validity for AUD because they were initially designed to detect
cognitive impairments in other diseases. Our goal was therefore to assess
the validity and the psychometric properties of the Brief Evaluation
of Alcohol-Related Neuropsychological Impairments (BEARNI), a new
screening tool especially designed to assess alcohol-related neuropsychological impairments.
254 healthy controls completed the BEARNI, and 58 also performed an
extensive neuropsychological battery. 73 patients with AUD underwent
both the BEARNI and the neuropsychological battery served as gold
standard for determining the patients’ cognitive status.
An exploratory factor analysis validated the BEARNI’s underlying
structure, highlighting five factors that reflected visuospatial abilities,
executive functions, ataxia, verbal episodic memory and verbal working
memory. The standardization of each BEARNI subtest and the two
total scores revealed that this test has sufficient diagnostic accuracy for
the detection of patients with cognitive and motor impairments. The
present study indicates that the BEARNI is a useful screening tool in
clinical settings for detecting AUD’s motor and cognitive impairments
and adjusting alcohol treatment.

Chronic, excessive alcohol consumption can affect brain structure and
function in enduring ways. Our study objectives were to quantify patterns
of brain structural and functional compromise associated with Alcohol
Use Disorder (AUD), identify factors that contribute to compromise,
and assess the potential for recovery. Men and women with and without

P. MAURAGE. Social Neurosciences in Alcohol-Use Disorders.
The cerebral impairments related to alcohol-dependence have been
largely described for the last decades, but most earlier works have focused on cognitive functions. More recently, it has been suggested that
beyond these well-known memory, attentional or executive disorders,
emotional and social abilities are also largely impaired in alcohol-related
disorders, these later deficits playing a crucial role in the development
and persistence of this addictive state. This talk will offer an overview
of the currently available literature on this emerging research field,

showing how the blooming of social and affective neurosciences in psychiatry and neurology offers new perspectives for exploring the brain
correlates of interpersonal difficulties in alcohol-related disorders. While
developed very recently, these neuropsychological and neuroimaging
studies have already clearly shown that alcohol-dependent individuals
are impaired in a wide range of social abilities, including the decoding
of negative facial emotions, affective empathy, theory of mind or social
exclusion sensitivity. The experimental and clinical implications of these
results will also be discussed, particularly by showing that innovative
neuropsychological programs are currently being developed to rehabilitate these social abilities, offering promising therapeutic perspectives.

M.E. BATES & J.F. BUCKMAN. Cognitive Remediation and
Different Trajectories of Cognitive Recovery in Persons with
Alcohol Use Disorders.
Neuropsychological and cognitive deficits are prevalent in persons seeking treatment for alcohol use disorders (AUDs). Cognitive impairments
are often overlooked both within and outside of treatment, although they
may vary from mild to quite severe across persons with AUDs. The impact of cognitive problems on mental and physical health, and social and
work-related functioning can be pervasive. As well, these problems may
present roadblocks to successful AUD treatment process and outcomes.
On average, the brain and cognition improve over time with abstinence
or markedly reduced alcohol use, yet the rate and extent of recovery is
variable across cognitive domains and individuals. An important question raised by these observations is whether it is possible to facilitate
treatment process and improve AUD treatment outcomes by directly
promoting cognitive recovery through cognitive remediation. A related
question concerns how such remediations might be effectively staged in
the treatment process to accommodate different prototypical trajectories
of cognitive recovery. This presentation will overview the development
of novel AUD interventions that involve cognitive remediation and how
such approaches may map onto individual differences in trajectories of
cognitive recovery in persons with AUD. Emerging evidence suggests
that such interventions can be effective in promoting cognitive recovery
in persons with AUD and other substance use disorders, and potentially increasing treatment efficacy. Translational approaches based on
cognitive science, neurophysiology, and neuroscience research may be
promising directions for effective treatment development that includes
cognitive rehabilitation.

Long-Term Effects of Traumatic Brain Injury in the Framingham
Study.
Objective: The long-term effects of traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) on
cognition and brain morphology is documented in high TBI risk populations. There is, however, a paucity of research in community-based
samples. This study determined whether self-reported history of TBI
validated by medical records was related to cognitive and neuroimaging
measures associated with brain aging.
Participants and Methods: Between 2009-2013, 2,517 Generation 3
and Omni Generation 2 participants from the Framingham Heart Study

59
were administered a neuropsychological test battery that included a
question on previous history of TBI. 521 participants responded that
they had previously sustained a TBI, but only 37 (7.1%) had medical
records that confirmed a TBI diagnosis by American Congress of Rehabilitation Medicine standards. We compared these participants to 177
participants, a subset of respondents, who responded “no” to history of
TBI and whose medical records indicated no history of TBI.
Results: The TBI group performed significantly poorer on tests of visual memory, attention, abstract reasoning, and psychomotor function
(p<0.05) compared to the no TBI group. Further the TBI group had
significantly greater white matter hyperintensity volume than the no TBI
group (p=0.039), whereas there was no difference in total and lobar
volumes (p<0.05) between the two groups.
Conclusions: Within a community-based population, self-reported TBI
history, corroborated by medical records, was related to cognitive and
neuroimaging phenotypes associated with vascular brain aging. These
findings suggest that a TBI earlier in life may place people at greater
risk for a neurodegenerative disorder later in life.

Early and Late Neurodegenerative Changes in White Matter
Integrity following TBI.
Objective: While recent research on traumatic brain injury (TBI) has
yielded important findings concerning short-term recovery, less is
known about late effects of injury and factors predicting long-term brain
structural and functional change. We examined whether white matter
(WM) structural integrity measured via diffusion tensor imaging (DTI)
differed between subjects earlier vs. later in their post-TBI recovery,
and how DTI metrics relate to cognition.
Participants and Methods: Fourteen individuals with Early TBI
(<1 year post-injury) and nine individuals with Chronic TBI (range:
5-28 years post-injury), who had sustained moderate-severe TBI (i.e.,
Glasgow Coma Scale of 3-12 or positive neuroimaging), and 12 healthy
controls were recruited. Each subject underwent DTI and cognitive testing. Quantitative tractography was used to measure fractional anisotropy (FA) in the cingulum bundle (CB) and the corpus callosum genu.
Results: While FA in the CB differed marginally between the Early
TBI and comparison groups (p=0.058), FA in the genu and CB differed
significantly between the Chronic TBI and control groups (p<0.05).
Even after controlling for age, time post-injury tended to predict FA of
the CB (r=-0.41, p=0.16) and the genu (r=-0.49, p=0.09), such that
decreased FA indicative of reduced WM integrity was associated with a
longer interval in the combined TBI sample. CB FA was also associated
with performance on the Visual Search and Attention Task, a test of
information processing speed (r=0.63), where higher FA was associated
with better performance.
Conclusions: While cross-sectional, these data suggest that TBI-induced neurodegenerative change detectable via DTI may continue over
time, even after accounting for effects of normal aging. Moreover, structural integrity of the CB is associated with measures of information
processing speed. Additional longitudinal research is needed to further
characterize the progression of post-TBI WM structural change and
additional factors influencing the rate and pattern of change.

D. KRCH, G. WYLIE & N.D. CHIARAVALLOTI. The Sagittal
Stratum as a Candidate Biomarker for Degree of Neuropathology
after Chronic TBI.
Objective: Diffuse axonal injury (DAI) is a key pathology after TBI,
disrupting white matter pathways and causing cognitive impairments.
Studies investigating white matter integrity after TBI have identified
specific fiber tracts related to cognitive performance. However, there is

60
little consensus regarding the relative importance of particular tracts to
predict domain-specific functioning. The goal of this study was to investigate whether reduced integrity of specific tracts differentially predicted
poorer memory, executive function, and processing speed. Time since
injury in this relationship was also evaluated.
Participants and Methods: Thirty individuals with moderate to severe TBI were evaluated. Diffusion tensor imaging fractional anisotropy
values were derived for major white matter tracts. Dependent variables included composites for verbal memory, visual memory, executive function, and processing speed. Stepwise multiple regressions were
performed for each dependent variable, with select white matter tracts
entered as the independent variables in step one and time since injury
in step two.
Results: The left sagittal stratum was a unique and significant predictor
of verbal memory; the right sagittal stratum was a unique and significant
predictor of visual memory, executive function, and processing speed.
A significant relationship between time since injury and white matter
integrity emerged only for verbal memory.
Conclusions: The sagittal stratum is a major subcortical fiber system linking fibers from the parietal, occipital, cingulate, and temporal
regions to the thalamus and other brainstem structures. The significant predictive relationship between this tract and performance in all
cognitive domains suggests that it may rival the corpus callosum in
vulnerability to DAI after TBI, thus serving as a possible biomarker for
neuropathology in chronic TBI.

L. DELANO-WOOD. Links Between Perfusion, White Matter
Integrity, and Cognition in Veterans with History of Mild-toModerate TBI.
Objective: Evidence suggests cerebral blood flow (CBF) alterations contribute to white matter (WM) disruption. Given the paucity of studies
investigating associations between CBF, WM integrity, and cognition
in the context of traumatic brain injury (TBI), we examined (1) the
association between CBF and DTI indices; (2) whether this relationship
is modified by time since TBI; and (3) imaging and cognitive associations in a cohort of Veterans with mild-to-moderate TBI (mmTBI). The
cingulate cortex and cingulum bundle were selected as a priori regions
of interest given links to thalamic and entorhinal areas important for
cognition coupled with known vulnerability of these regions to TBI.
Participants and Methods: 32 Veterans with mmTBI underwent neuroimaging and cognitive assessment. Resting CBF was measured with
Multiphase Pseudocontinuous Arterial Spin Labeling (MPPCASL) and
averaged across Freesurfer-derived parcellations of the cingulate bilaterally. WM integrity was measured with DTI and tractography quantified
mean fractional anisotropy (FA) of the cingulum bilaterally.
Results: Regression analyses controlling for age and PTSD symptoms
revealed a significant Time Since Injury x Resting CBF interaction for
the left cingulum (p<.005). Decreased CBF was significantly associated
with reduced cingulum FA in the chronic phase; however, no such association was observed for participants whose TBI was less remote. Finally,
decreased cingulum FA was significantly associated with poorer verbal
memory performance in those with reduced CBF.
Conclusions: Preliminary results show that reduced perfusion of the
cingulate cortex predicted poorer WM integrity in our sample of Veterans with mmTBI who were further removed from their TBI events. In
addition, in those with lower CBF, reduced WM integrity was associated
with poorer memory performance. Findings suggest altered CBF may
represent a useful biomarker for poor WM integrity and cognitive outcomes in the chronic phase of mmTBI.

Pre-treatment differences in clinical estimates of working memory
capacity determine memory rehabilitation efficacy in TBI.
Objective: Memory-impairment is common following traumatic brain
injury (TBI). Due to the heterogeneous nature of memory-impairment
following TBI, the success of cognitive rehabilitation is mixed. Presently,
we explored how individual differences impact rehabilitation outcomes.
Specifically, we investigated whether working memory capacity (WMC)
can be used as a cognitive-marker to identify who will and will not
improve from memory rehabilitation.
Participants and Methods: Post-hoc analysis on complete data from
65 moderate to severe TBI participants enrolled in the TBI-MEM randomized clinical trial. The treatment group completed 10 sessions of
the modified Story Memory Technique in which subjects were taught
a memory strategy focusing on the use of context and imagery to remember information. The placebo-control group engaged in active
therapy sessions that did not involve learning the memory strategy.
The main outcome variable was long-term memory percent retention
change scores for an unorganized list of words from the California Verbal Learning Test.
Results: There was an interaction between Group and WMC (p=.008,
ηp2=.12) whereby individuals with higher WMC showed a benefit from
treatment compared to their low capacity peers. Individual differences
in WMC accounted for 45% of the variance in whether or not TBI participants in the treatment group benefited from applying the modified
Story Memory Technique to unorganized information.
Conclusions: Individuals with higher WMC showed a significantly
greater benefit when applying the modified Story Memory Technique
compensatory strategy to unorganized information as compared to those
with low WMC. WMC is a useful cognitive-marker for identifying TBI
participants’ response to memory rehabilitation.

Evaluate Linguistic Processing in TBI.
Objective: This study evaluated auditory ERPs in the cognitive domains
(N1-P2, N400, and P300) as a TBI biomarker focusing on atypical
amplitude and latency on a semantic categorization task.
Participants and Methods: Participants (N=8; mean age 42.4 years
SD=10.1; mean education 14.8 years SD=3.4; 75% white, 25% African
American; 62.5% male) with a history of TBI (mean time since injury
16.3 years SD=8.2) and healthy control participants (N=8; mean age
41.3 years SD=9.8; mean education 17.0 years SD=1.1; 100% white;
62.5% male). ERPs were recorded with a 64 channel Neuroscan system
while participants responded “YES” or “NO” for word pairs being a
semantic match. Mean amplitudes and peak latencies were analyzed
for N1-P2, N4, and P300 components using a mixed design ANOVA.
Participants also completed the RBANS.
Results: P2 and P300 components showed significant group differences. Controls exhibited greater P2 amplitude than the TBI group
[F(1,14)=4.711, p=.048] at the Cz electrode. A significant interaction
between midline electrode sites and group was noted for P300 amplitude
[F(5,70)=3.451, p=.008]. Controls showed maximum P300 amplitude
at parietal electrodes while the TBI group had a broader parietal to
frontal activation pattern. A clear P300 pattern emerged where 4 of the
TBI participants had similar P300 morphology to controls (high ERP
performance group) and recruitment of frontal areas and the remaining
4 TBI participants had a reduced or delayed P300 (low ERP performance group) and no frontal activity. The high ERP performance TBI

Forty Fourth Annual INS Meeting Abstracts
group performed better on the RBANS (RBANS total score mean=106.3
SD=22.9) than the low ERP performance group (RBANS total score
mean=78.5 SD=22.7), though this difference was not significant due
to low power.
Conclusions: We believe this is the first study to demonstrate an equipotential distribution of activity in TBI. Frontal P300 activity was seen
primarily in those who had successfully compensated for their brain
injury. This relationship requires further exploration.

Premanifest Huntington’s Disease: a Double Dissociation with
Caudate and Hippocampus Volumes.
Objective: Spatial information can be coded in egocentric (self-based)
or allocentric (landmark-based) coordinates. Rodent studies show a
critical role for the caudate in egocentric processing and the hippocampus in allocentric processing. We hypothesized that gene positive
individuals with premanifest HD (pmHD), which causes caudate atrophy, would show greater impairment on egocentric than allocentric
working memory. Further, egocentric performance would correlate with
dorsolateral caudate volumes, whereas allocentric would correlate with
hippocampal volumes.
Participants and Methods: Egocentric and allocentric spatial working memory tasks were administered to 16 pmHD individuals and 17
age and sex matched controls. Each task had 80 trials to remember 2
locations over 1-sec delays. There was one difference between these
otherwise identical tasks: locations could only be coded in either egocentric or allocentric coordinates. Accuracy was analyzed using a mixed
model ANOVA and correlated with caudate and hippocampal regional
volumes. The volumes were measured using a multiatlas-based labeling
algorithm and deformation-based morphometry, with significances adjusted for multiple comparisons using the false discovery rate.
Results: The test by group interaction was significant, p=.02. The
pmHD individuals were impaired on both tasks, but they were significantly more impaired on the egocentric, d=1.68, than the allocentric,
d=.75. Only egocentric performance correlated with caudate regional
volumes, and specifically it correlated with the dorsolateral head, right
more than left, a region that receives inputs from dorsolateral prefrontal
cortex (p<.001). In contrast, only allocentric performance correlated
with regional hippocampal volumes, specifically with right dentate gyrus
and left CA3 (p<.001).
Conclusions: The dorsolateral caudate is important for egocentric
working memory, which can explain the severe impairment in pmHD.
Allocentric working memory, in contrast, appears to rely on the
hippocampus.

demonstrated in amnesic patients, but generally using very simple material. Our aim was to examine learning of more complex material in
neurological amnesia.
Participants and Methods: We examined a profoundly amnesic professional actor of international status, and we required him to learn
passages from plays he had performed across 5 decades and ‘control’
passages from plays he had not performed. Autobiographical memories
and background contextual information were also examined. Comparison was made with the learning curves of non-amnesic professional
actors on passages from plays they had or had not performed in.
Results: From a lower baseline at trial1, our actor was able to learn
the passages with a normal slope to his learning curve (incremental
learning) across 5 learning trials. He also showed a significant advantage
for passages from plays he had performed in, despite not being able
to identify the plays, nor to recall the fact that he had performed in
some of them. He showed severe autobiographical amnesia for the past
time-periods in which he had performed these plays.
Conclusions: New semantic learning of complex material can occur
in amnesia, possibly by slow cortical circuits, and our actor employed
long-established semantic/procedural schemas, in the form of his professional skills, to help learn the passages.

Divergent Influences of Multiple Cardiovascular Risk Factors on
Cognition, Grey and White Matter Morphology.
Objective: Hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidemia, and obesity have each
been associated with increased risk of late-onset dementia as well as
preclinical alterations in cognition and brain structure; however, this
information often comes from studies of individual risk factors. Our
study aim was to examine the association between multiple cardiovascular risk factors, cognition and brain structure.
Participants and Methods: A diverse sample of 124 adults
(age~59.8+13.1; 41% African American) underwent neuropsychological and cardiovascular assessments and structural MRI. Nine cardiovascular risk factors were subjected to principal component analysis
resulting in a four-component solution representing 1-cholesterol, 2-glucose dysregulation, 3-metabolic dysregulation, and 4-blood pressure.
Freesurfer assessed whole-brain cortical thickness. FSL determined
tract-based fractional anisotropy (FA).
Results: Higher blood pressure component scores predicted lower learning, memory, and executive functioning, as well as cortical thinning
within the right lateral occipital lobe. Elevated glucose dysregulation
predicted poorer attention/information processing and associated with
reductions in FA within the right sagittal striatum and bilateral superior
longitudinal fasciculi. Cholesterol and metabolic component scores did
not predict cognition; cholesterol did associate with increased cortical
thickness within left caudal middle frontal cortex while metabolic dysfunction associated with right superior parietal lobe, left inferior parietal
lobe, and left precuneus cortical thickness.
Conclusions: Results suggest that blood pressure and glucose dysregulation associated with distinct cognitive alterations and both grey and
white matter vulnerability. Greater understanding of the distinct and
overlapping underpinnings of cardiovascular risk factors on the brain
may assist in identifying specific vulnerability profiles that can be monitored for change in future longitudinal studies of affected individuals.

cognitive reserve on vascular cognitive impairment after stroke.
Objective: The extent of vascular cognitive impairment (VCI) in stroke
patients varies greatly across individuals, even when the same amount
of brain damage is present. Cognitive reserve, as indexed by education level, might explain these differences, but results on the effects

62
of cognitive reserve on are inconclusive and possibly confounded by
age-cohort effects.
Participants and Methods: First, we performed a meta-analysis of
the existing literature on cognitive reserve after stroke, identifying 11
studies (total N=2,698). Second, we examined the effect of formal education level on VCI in patients who had experienced an ischemic stroke
between the ages of 18 and 50 and were cognitively assessed on average
11.0 (SD=8.2) years post-onset (the FUTURE Study cohort). The total
sample consisted of 277 young-stroke patients (mean age at follow-up
50.9 (SD=10.3). Age- and education-adjusted expected scores were
computed using 146 matched stroke-free controls.
Results: The meta-analysis showed an overall effect size (z’) of 0.31
(95%CI 0.20-0.42), indicating that cognitive reserve had a small to medium effect on the extent of VCI. Analyses of the FUTURE data showed
that the effect of education on post-stroke executive dysfunction was
mediated by age (β age -0.015, p<.05). Below-average performance in
the attention domain was more frequent for the low-education patients
(χ 2(2) = 9.77, p<.05).
Conclusions: Cognitive reserve as indexed by education level is related
to post-stroke VCI, but effects are small and largely mediated by age-cohort effect. Possibly, other estimates for cognitive reserve may be more
valid, but these have not been studied in relation to VCI.

S.N. VILLARD & S. KIRAN. Between-Session and Within-Session
Intra-Individual Variability in Attention in Aphasia.
Objective: Patients with aphasia (PWA) have been found to exhibit
increased between-session intra-individual variability (BS-IIV) in performance on non-linguistic attention tasks relative to controls. The
current study examined both BS-IIV and within-session IIV (WS-IIV)
in performance on a series of attention tasks of varying complexity.
PWA were expected to exhibit increased BS-IIV and WS-IIV relative to
controls, as well as increased BS-IIV and increased WS-IIV with higher
task complexity.
Participants and Methods: Data was collected from 17 PWA and
17 controls. Each participant completed a series of five computerized
experimental tasks of incrementally increasing complexity. This series
of five tasks was administered four times, on four different days
Results: To examine BS-IIV and WS-IIV in reaction time (RT), coefficients of variation (COVs, or the standard deviation over the mean)
were calculated for each participant, on each task. Specifically, a COV
representing BS-IIV in RT (BS-COV) was calculated for each participant, each task, using data collected across the four sessions. Similarly,
a COV representing WS-IIV in RT (WS-COV) was calculated for each
participant, each task, using data collected within a single session. A 2
(Group) x 5 (Task) R-ANOVA showed that BS-COVs were higher for
PWA than controls (F(1, 32) = 4.79, p < .05). WS-COVs were also
found to be higher for PWA than for controls (F(1, 32) = 7.61, p < .01).
A significant effect of Task on WS-COV within PWA was also observed
(F(4, 64) = 9.47, p < .001), such that the most complex task elicited
higher WS-COVs than any other.
Conclusions: PWA showed increased BS-IIV and WS-IIV in attention
relative to controls; also, increased task complexity elicited increased
WS-IIV in PWA. Findings have important implications for assessment
and treatment in aphasia, as both testing and therapy require consistent
attention to complex stimuli both from moment to moment and from
day to day.

T.S. PATERSON, R. SHAPIRO & W.L. THORNTON. Self-efficacy
Mediates the Relationship Between Traditionally Measured
Intelligence, but not Everyday Problem Solving Ability, and
Medication Adherence, in Renal Transplant Recipients.
Objective: Our laboratory has previously shown that everyday problem
solving (EPS) ability predicts medication adherence in renal transplant
recipients (RTR; Gelb et al., 2010); that EPS provides a better predictor
of adherence than traditionally measured intelligence (TIQ; Paterson et
al., 2015); and that self-efficacy (SE) is positively associated with adherence in RTR (Demian et al., 2015). To further understand adherence
in RTR, we examine whether SE mediates the relationships between (1)
TIQ & adherence, and (2) EPS & adherence, respectively.
Participants and Methods: RTR had undergone successful transplant
(N= 179) at least 6 months prior to participation. Medication adherence
was measured with the Transplant Effects Questionnaire (TxEQ), TIQ
was determined via the KBIT-II, and EPS ability was determined by
number of safe/effective solutions generated for real-world scenarios
(EPS Test). SE was measured via the Self-Efficacy Scale (SES) and
Medication Adherence Self-Efficacy Scale (MASES). Multiple mediation
analyses (Preacher and Hayes, 2008) were used to examine two models.
Model 1 included the KBIT-II as the IV, SES and MASES as mediators,
and the TxEQ as the DV; model 2 included the EPS Test as the IV, SES
and MASES as mediators, and the TxEQ as the DV.
Results: Demographic variables related to the TxEQ (gender & ESL
status) were entered as covariates. In the first model (TIQ as the IV), the
SE variables completely mediated the effect of TIQ on adherence, 95%
CI [.0025, .0277]. By contrast, in model 2 (EPS as the IV), SE did not
mediate the relationship between EPS and adherence.
Conclusions: These results indicate the importance of general and medication adherence specific SE in understanding adherence behaviours.
These findings also highlight differences between TIQ and EPS ability,
and emphasize the potential utility of EPS measures in predicting adherence in RTR. More research is necessary to better understand the
predictive utility of self-efficacy and EPS for predicting medication
adherence in this group.

K.A. WALKER, R. VENEZIA, K. HAPPER, A. KAUR, S. BRICE,
A. HIRALALL & S. SCHAFFER. Low Mean Arterial Pressure in
Critically Ill ICU Patients is Associated With Poorer Memory and
MMSE at Discharge and Follow-Up.
Objective: Approximately 30-80% of patients admitted to the intensive
care unit (ICU) for non-neurological conditions experience significant
cognitive impairment at follow-up. Although delirium and hypoxia in
the ICU have been associated with worse cognitive outcome, these variables do not fully account for cognitive declines. The current analysis
was conducted to determine whether systemic perfusion, as measured
by mean arterial pressure (MAP), predicted cognitive status at ICU
discharge and at follow-up.
Participants and Methods: 34 individuals without pre-existing neurological or cognitive impairment admitted to the ICU for greater than
72 hours and diagnosed with septic shock and/or respiratory failure
were enrolled. General cognitive (MMSE) and memory (RBANS List
Learning) functioning were assessed at the time of ICU discharge and
at 3-month follow-up. MAP, delirium, sedation level, and serum oxygenation (Sp02) were continuously monitored during the ICU stay.
Results: A total of 241 ICU days were used for this analysis. Bivariate
correlation indicated that low MAP was associated with poorer MMSE
(r = .38; p < .05) and memory (r = .45; p < .05) functioning at time of
discharge, and poorer memory at 3-month follow-up (r = .62; p < .10).
After covarying for total days of delirium, cumulative sedation, and total
hypoxia (Sp02), MAP predicted memory (β = .55; p < .05; R2 Δ = .25)
and MMSE (β = .65; p < .01; R2 Δ = .23) at discharge, and memory
functioning at 3-month follow-up (β = .86; p < .10; R2 Δ = .27). Despite
a large effect size, the latter finding did not reach statistical significance.

Forty Fourth Annual INS Meeting Abstracts
Conclusions: Abnormally low arterial perfusion in critically ill patients on the ICU, as measured by MAP, is related to poorer cognitive
functioning at the time of ICU discharge and at 3-month follow-up.
Although preliminary, these findings suggest that reduced arterial
perfusion in the context of critical illness may be linked to prolonged
cognitive impairment.

Plenary B. There’s More There:
Extracting New Information From the Functional
MRI Signal Using Novel Acquisition and Processing
Methods
Presenter: Peter A. Bandettini

11:00 a.m.–12:00 p.m.
P.A. BANDETTINI. There’s More There: Extracting New
Information From the Functional MRI Signal Using Novel
Acquisition and Processing Methods.
Our group has been focusing for the past several years on developing
methods for detecting and characterizing ever more subtle and elusive
fMRI changes in task-based and resting-state fMRI. Using methods that
incorporate novel acquisition methods, novel activation paradigms, and
novel post-processing methods, we have generated some surprising

63
findings. In this lecture, I will be discussing three primary approaches
and findings. The first will be our approach to reducing artifactual time
series noise and artifactual fluctuations. This approach involves the use
of a multi-echo echo planar imaging (ME-EPI) acquisition. The principle we use is that blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) shows echo time
dependence while noise and artifact does not. Using this basic principle
we are able to identify and remove non-BOLD signal changes. The
second approach is massive averaging (9 hours of scanning) of a single
subject’s activation data and perform model-free analysis to determine
that, in fact, all gray matter is active with even a simple task. Lastly,
our third approach is to use windowed correlation analysis on time
series to determine what ongoing task each subject is performing. This
dynamic connectivity-based brain reading demonstrated to be more
sensitive than magnitude assessment in determining ongoing tasks, and
the informative connections extend well outside of the regions shown to
change in magnitude with the task
Learning Objectives
After this lecture, the student should be able to:
1. State the principle by which multi-echo EPI separates BOLD from
non-BOLD fluctuations,
2. Describe the advantages and disadvantages of a model-free approach
in fMRI activation-based analysis, and
3. State the steps involved with performing sliding window correlation
analysis for ongoing cognition assessment.

the Metacognitive Index: A MMPI-2-RF and BRIEF-A Study.
Objective: The Behavioral Rating Inventory of Executive Function,
Adult Version (BRIEF-A) was designed to assess perceived executive
function in daily life. The BRIEF-A Metacognition Index (MI) aims to
measure working memory, initiation, planning, monitoring task performance, and organizing one’s physical environment. However, the
extent to which MI specifically measures perceived cognitive ability
versus other psychological factors remains unclear. The current study
examined the association between MI and relevant MMPI-2-RF scales
to help clarify this issue.
Participants and Methods: Valid MMPI-2-RF and BRIEF-A profiles
according to manual cutoffs were collected from veterans evaluated
at a VA neuropsychology clinic (N=72). Correlations and a series of
hierarchical regression models were performed to evaluate the unique
contributions of MMPI-2-RF restructured clinical (RC) scales and somatic/cognitive scales to BRIEF-A MI.
Results: BRIEF-A MI correlated significantly with all RC scales except
RC3. It was most strongly correlated with RCd (r=.61) and RC7 (r=.44).
Regarding MMPI-2-RF somatic/cognitive scales, BRIEF-A MI correlated
significantly with MLS (r=.42), NUC (r=.27), and COG (r=.43). Hierarchical regression models were used to predict BRIEF-MI, beginning
with RCd and adding the other scales that correlated significantly with

MI. Only RCd accounted for significant variance (ps<.001), and other
scales failed to uniquely predict BRIEF-MI scores.
Conclusions: MI is not specific to complaints about executive function.
Furthermore, RCd best predicted MI, suggesting that MI is saturated
with general unhappiness and dissatisfaction, which is commonly seen
in self-report scales of psychiatric symptoms. Other, more specific, scales
of psychiatric, cognitive, or somatic symptoms offer no additional contribution to MI. Findings raise questions regarding the specificity of MI
to metacognitive complaints.

Social Desirability and the Relationship between Subjective
Ratings on Cognition and Actual Performance.
Objective: Social desirability (SD) refers to the inclination to present
oneself in a positive manner. SD bias may influence cognitive self-report measures, which are frequently obtained in neuropsychology. The
purpose of this study was to determine the relationship between SD
bias and subjective cognitive ratings of general cognitive functioning
and ratings of performance on a specific task.
Participants and Methods: Fifty-seven euthymic outpatients with Bipolar Disorder (BD) and 41 healthy community volunteers completed
self-report measures of SD bias (Marlowe-Crowne Social Desirability
Scale-SDS), as well as subjective ratings of either general cognitive
functioning (Cognitive Failures Questionnaire-CFQ) or task-specific
cognitive functioning (prediction and post-diction ratings of verbal and
nonverbal memory performance on the Extended Complex Figure Test
(ECFT) and the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT)). Pearson
correlations were used to assess group-level associations between SDS
and subjective ratings. Partial correlations examined the relationships

64
between subjective and objective cognitive performance before and after
controlling for SDS.
Results: SDS scores were negatively correlated with the CFQ in both
BD patients (r=-.52, p<.01) and healthy volunteers (r=.-34, p<.05),
but did not significantly correlate with any of the remaining subjective
ratings. Correlations between subjective cognitive ratings and objective
cognitive performance before and after controlling for SD revealed a
minor influence on CFQ (before r = -.22, after r= -.28 in patients; before
r =.14, after r=.07) but not on task-specific ratings.
Conclusions: These data suggest that although SD bias has the potential to influence general cognitive self-ratings (e.g., CFQ), it does not
appear to influence task-specific cognitive self-ratings. Assessment of
SDS bias may therefore be a useful way to augment the validity of subjective cognitive measures, particularly when they involve self-ratings
of general cognitive functioning.

S.L. AITA, B.D. HILL, A. BOETTCHER, C. SOFKO, E. CORLEY,
B. SLAGEL & E. ELLIOTT. Revisiting the Biber Cognitive
Estimation Test: A Novel IQ-Criterion Based Approach to Scoring.
Objective: The Biber Cognitive Estimation Test (BCET) is a 20-item
task that requires estimation of answers in five categories: time/duration, quantity, weight, and distance. The objective of this study was to
compare the original distribution-based method of scoring the BCET
to a new criterion-derived scoring method.
Participants and Methods: The present study consisted of 280 healthy
participants (mean age=21 years SD=4.3; 56% female; mean education=13 years SD=1; 72% white, 21% African American, 4% Asian,
2% Latino, 1% other; mean WAIS-IV FSIQ=102 SD=11) who completed the BCET and a larger neuropsychological battery. The BCET
was scored two ways: the original norms from Bullard et al. (2004) that
defined scores as correct if they fell within the middle 90% of their normative sample and a new method of scoring the most frequent responses
given by individuals with a FSIQ of >119 as correct.
Results: In this sample, the mean of the Bullard scoring method was
17.1 SD=1.9 and the mean of the new IQ-criterion approach was 13.2
SD=2.3. There was a significant difference between these scoring methods [t(279)=36.3, p<.001]. Both scoring methods were significantly
correlated with WAIS-IV FSIQ and index scores as well as Raven’s
Advanced Progressive Matrices, but the new criterion-derived scoring
method had higher correlations with all measures except WAIS-IV PSI.
The highest correlations for the criterion-derived scoring method were
r=.33 for FSIQ and r=.32 for WMI.
Conclusions: Compared to the Bullard BCET scoring method, the new
method of scoring the BCET based on an IQ criterion appears to improve the utility of the BCET as demonstrated by stronger relations
with multiple other measures of fluid cognition, suggesting improved
construct validity. We believe this is due to the new scoring method
resulting in increased variability in score allowing for greater individual differences in performance. Future studies on measuring cognitive
estimation should work to improve item content, answer formatting,
and scoring methodologies.

J. DE PAULA, M. NEVES & G.M. LAGE. Fixation duration predicts
performance in the Grooved Pegboard Test: An analysis of two
different tasks using the preferred and non-preferred hands.
Objective: The aim of this study was to investigate whether the duration of fixation can predict the performance in different task conditions
(Place and Remove) with the preferred and non-preferred hands

Participants and Methods: Fifty-two right-handed undergraduate students (33 male and 19 female), with a mean age of 22.22 (±3.57) years,
performed the Grooved Pegboard Test. SMI Eye-Tracking Glasses were
used during the task, with a binocular time resolution of 30 Hz. The
videos were recorded in iView software, and data were analyzed using
BeGaze software. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test revealed that movement time, fixation duration, and number of fixations measured during
the Place and Remove tasks and with preferred and non-preferred hands
did not violate the assumption of normal distribution. Therefore, we
conducted Linear Regression [19] and General Linear Model repeated
measures analyses. Bonferroni’s test was used as post hoc analysis, and
the significance level of 0.05 was adopted for all statistical analyses.
Results: A significant main effect of hands and tasks were found in
Number of fixations [F(2.021; 104.119) = 297.350, p<0.001], Fixation durations [F(1.577; 83.567) = 77.567, p<0.001] and Movement
time [F(2.041; 108.186) = 547,826, p<0.001]. In addition, simple linear regression using fixation duration was the predictor variable and
movement time was the dependent variable in the Place task with the
preferred hand (R = 31%) and the non-preferred hand (R = 41%), as
well as in the Remove task with the preferred hand (R = 11%) and the
non-preferred hand (R = 25%).
Conclusions: In conclusion, our results show that the duration of fixation differentially predicted the performance in the Grooved Pegboard
Test when preferred and non-preferred hands were used, as well as when
different subtests were applied.

MMPI-2-RF Content Validity Indicators and BDI-II / BAI
Responding.
Objective: Face valid symptom inventories (e.g., Beck Depression
Inventory, BDI-II; Beck Anxiety Inventory, BAI) are popular screening measures for psychological functioning. The relationship between
symptom validity tests (SVTs) and similar measures of psychopathology
has received attention (e.g., Forbey et al., 2013; Garcia et al., 2010);
the current study aims to examine the impact of MMPI-2-RF content
validity and neuropsychological performance validity tests (PVTs) on
BDI-II and BAI responding.
Participants and Methods: Participants completed general neuropsychological assessments at a large VA Medical Center that included BDI-II
and/or BAI. Some completed the MMPI-2, which was converted to the
MMPI-2-RF, along with the BDI-II (n=88) and the BAI (n=50). BDI-II/
BAI responding was compared according to valid vs. non-valid MMPI2-RF profiles; validity criteria included F-r, Fp-r, Fs-r, FBS-r, and
RBS<100 vs. any >100. Another subset completed PVTs (e.g., TOMM,
RDS) as well as the BDI-II (n=169) and BAI (n=122). Self-report scores
were examined according to credible vs. noncredible status (>2 or >3
PVT failures depending on number administered).
Results: BDI-II and BAI scores were significantly higher with SVT
failure, F(1,86)=41.24, p<.001, η2=.32, and F(1,48)=43.32, p<.001,
η2=.47, respectively, but not with PVT failure. In this sample, a score
of BDI-II>36 and BAI>31 could differentiate validity status at 90%
specificity with 36.4% and 43.8% sensitivity, respectively. Of all severe-ranged scores, 15 BDI-II (75%) and 14 BAI scores (78%) were
invalid.
Conclusions: These results build upon growing literature defining the
need to interpret all self-report inventories in light of SVTs. Psychological screening measures, while popular for brevity and face validity,
are affected by over-reporting response patterns, to the point where a
large majority of scores in the highly elevated range were associated with
symptom invalidity. Further, these results highlight differences between
constructs assessed by SVTs and PVTs.

D. ASHISH, J.R. SOBLE, J. MARCEAUX & K. MCCOY. Wechsler
Adult Intelligence Scale-4th Edition (WAIS-IV) Performance in a
Mixed Clinical Sample of Monolingual and Bilingual Veterans.
Objective: Intelligence tests strive to overcome biases due to language
and culture with partial success. This study’s objective was to examine
the effect of English as a second language (ESL) on Wechsler Adult
Intelligence Scale–IV (WAIS-IV) performance in a veteran sample.
Participants and Methods: Data were collected from a mixed outpatient clinical sample of 117 veterans (M-age=58.54, SD=12.15; 88%
men; 29% bilingual English/Spanish [ESL]) who were administered the
WAIS-IV. Thirty-eight percent (N=44) did not have cognitive impairment (nCI), whereas 62% were cognitively impaired (CI; mild-CI, N=56;
major-CI/dementia N=17). Multivariate analysis of covariance (MANCOVA) compared language group performance (ESL vs. English-only
[EO]) on the WAIS-IV indices and subtests while controlling for education and cognitive impairment severity.
Results: MANCOVA was significant, Wilks’s Λ=.77, F(14, 100)=2.12,
p<.05, partial-η2=.23. Follow-up univariate tests revealed the EO group
(M=97.77, SD=12.74) scored higher than the ESL group (M=87.41,
SD=11.43) on the Verbal Comprehension Index (VCI), F(1,113)=11.33,
p<.01, partial-η2=.09, and all three VCI subtests. EO (M=93.71,
SD=12.63) scored higher than ESL (M=87.00, SD=10.41) on the Perceptual Reasoning Index (PRI), F(1,113)=4.41, p<.05, partial-η2=.04,
though none of the PRI subtests differed significantly. EO (M=91.58,
SD=13.48) also scored higher than ESL (M=82.74, SD=10.92) on the
Working Memory Index (WMI), F(1,113)=7.69, p<.01, partial-η2=.06,
with significant differences on Digit Span, F(1,113)=11.55, p<.01, partial-η2=.09, but not Arithmetic. Groups did not differ significantly on
the Processing Speed Index (PSI), F(1,113)=0.64, p>.05.
Conclusions: The ESL group performed significantly lower on several
WAIS-IV indices including both verbal and some nonverbal tasks after
controlling for education and impairment severity. Thus, a possible
overlay of primary language on nonverbal and working memory performances is suggested.

I. BABAKHANYAN, B.S. MCKENNA, K.B. CASALETTO &
R.K. HEATON. NIH Toolbox Emotion Domain: Creation of Census
Stratified Normative Data, Summary Scales and Base Rates for
Distressed Emotional Functioning.
Objective: We examined the influence of demographic variables on
the NIH Toolbox Emotion Battery (EB), developed census stratified
norms, as well as summary indices. Base rates of “distressed” emotional
functioning are provided to inform indicators of problematic emotions.
Participants and Methods: The EB, comprised of 17 scales for ages
18-85, was administered to 1036 English-speaking adults as part of the
NIH Toolbox norming project. Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) was
conducted to examine the underlying factor structures. Confirmatory
Factor Analysis (CFA) was conducted to confirm the model identified
from the EFA. Model fit was evaluated with CFI, TLI, SRMR, and RMSEA. Summary scores were created based on factor weights from CFA
results. Emotional distress was defined by 1 standard deviation towards
the problematic direction on each scale.
Results: Age, gender and education accounted for only small portions of
variance on the unadjusted 17 scales (R2<.09 for age, <.03 education,
<.02 gender). Given the small associations, demographically-corrected
scores are not recommended. We created uncorrected scores weighted to
the 2010 Census demographics. EFA resulted in a three-factor solution
with 15 of the 17 scales: (1)Negative Affect (NA) (2)Social Satisfaction (SS) (3)Psychological Well-Being (PW). CFA supported this factor

65
structure; CFI = 0.91, RMSEA = 0.085, and SRMR = 0.052. These
values fall within the acceptable-good range for model fit indices and
our final solution was the best compared to other solutions. Consistent with use of a 1 SD cutoff, base rates for emotional distress in the
normative sample revealed 14.3% distress for NA, 16.6% for SS, and
15.0% for PW.
Conclusions: This study provided census corrected norms for the EB,
established 3 summary scores, and confirmed expected base rates for
emotional distress in a population-based survey. Summary scores should
be applied to clinical samples to further validate the factor structures
and investigate emotional distress rates in medical and psychiatric
populations.

J.S. MILLER, D. HAN & V. ZIZAK. Screening for Cognitive Decline
in a Veteran Population with the Montreal Cognitive Assessment
(MoCA) and the Benson Figure.
Objective: As managed healthcare increasingly requires rapid evaluation of a burgeoning geriatric patient population, brief and effective
assessment tools are ever more in demand. The MoCA is the most widely
used screening instrument for Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) and dementia worldwide. Research has acknowledged the instrument’s limited
utility for detecting visual memory deficits; this may limit the measure’s
ability to identify related impairments in cognitive decliners. Thus, the
addition of neuropsychological instruments may improve diagnostic
accuracy. These investigators sought to improve diagnostic accuracy of
the MoCA by adding a brief nonverbal memory task (Benson Figure).
Participants and Methods: Some patients were only administered a
cognitive screener due to the severity of impairment; these individuals
were inherently less cognitively intact [MoCA: M=21.93, SD=3.78, n=47
(included); M=17.93, SD=5.62, n=33 (excluded)]. Final sample consisted of older Veterans with normal cognition (N=8), MCI (N=27), and
dementia (N=12) who completed a neuropsychological battery. Majority
of the sample consisted of males (96%) and Caucasians (62%). No significant differences in age, gender, ethnicity, and education were found.
Regression analyses were used to determine the variance accounted for
by the MoCA and Benson Figure (10’ delay) within cognitive diagnosis
(normal, MCI, dementia).
Results: Regression analyses yielded moderate association (R2 = 0.19)
between the MoCA and cognitive diagnosis F (1,45) =10.63, p<0.01,
and strong association (R2 = 0.41) between the Benson 10’ Delay and
cognitive diagnosis F (1,45) =31.81, p<0.001. Hierarchical linear regression revealed the Benson 10’ Delay accounted for an additional
22.7% of variance with a significant change in R2, [F (1,44)=17.18,
p<0.001]. Together they account for 41.8% of the total variance within
cognitive diagnosis [F (2,44)=15.82, p<0.001].
Conclusions: Results suggest the addition of a nonverbal memory test
to the MoCA improves detection of cognitive decline.

J. BERNSTEIN, J. LANGFITT, L. MITCHELL, J. BAZARIAN &
M. CALAMIA. Validity of the King-Devick Test in Post-Acute
Concussion and Chronic Partial Sleep Restriction Populations.
Objective: The King-Devick (K-D) test is a brief, timed test of eye
scanning and number-naming that has been shown to be sensitive to the
immediate effects of concussion and short-term sleep deprivation. We
assessed whether the K-D is sensitive to longer-term effects associated
with post-acute concussion and chronic partial sleep restriction (SR).
Participants and Methods: Participants were recruited for one of
two studies: 13 recently concussed participants and 17 non-concussed

66
controls were recruited to assess the effects of post-acute concussion
(m=2.5 weeks post-injury), and 26 healthy participants were recruited
to assess the effects of SR on K-D performance in a within-subjects
design. All participants completed the K-D as well as tests of convergent validity (e.g., Brief Test of Attention) and divergent validity (e.g.,
Hopkins Adult Reading Test).
Results: Consistent with hypotheses, recently concussed participants
took longer to complete the K-D than non-concussed participants (56.2
vs. 46.4 seconds, t(28)=2.72, p<.01), and participants in SR performed
worse on the K-D relative to their normal sleep quantity baselines (47.6
vs. 42.8, t(24)=2.64, p<.05). Recently concussed participants and participants in SR also performed worse on tests of working memory relative
to their comparison groups. In the concussion study, changes in performance on the K-D was associated with changes in working memory
and processing speed (e.g., Brief Test of Attention, r(28)=-.47, p<.01).
Changes in K-D performance from baseline to SR were of half the effect
size to that observed between the concussion and control groups (4.8
vs. 9.8 seconds).
Conclusions: These findings suggest that the K-D may be sensitive to
the residual effects of post-acute concussion and to SR, and that concussion and SR may affect similar cognitive domains. Larger comparative studies are needed to better assess the validity of the K-D in these
populations, as well as to assess differences in effect sizes between them.

M. CALAMIA. Self-Reported vs. Informant-Reported Depressive
Symptoms in an Outpatient Neuropsychology Clinic Sample.
Objective: Previous studies have shown discrepancies in self-reported
vs. informant reported depressive symptoms for specific patient groups
(e.g., dementia: Snow et al., 2005; Parkinson’s disease: Cimino et al.,
2011). We explored the relationship between self-reported and informant-reported depressive symptoms in an outpatient neuropsychology
clinic sample.
Participants and Methods: 62 patients with a variety of diagnoses
(e.g., vascular dementia, epilepsy, depression, traumatic brain injury)
were seen in an outpatient neuropsychology clinic and completed the
Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II) as part of their evaluation. Informants (i.e., the patients’ spouses, parents, or other individuals who knew
them well) completed the General Depression Scale from the Inventory
of Depression and Anxiety Symptoms (IDAS-II). Informants also reported on their own caregiver distress (i.e., Zarit Caregiver Burden
Inventory).
Results: BDI-II and IDAS-II scores were only moderately correlated
(r(60) = .42, p<.05). Higher discrepancies between informant-reported
and self-reported depressive symptoms were associated with worse patient verbal memory performance (AVLT Delayed Recall, r(60) = -.47,
p<.05). Discrepancies for ratings of depressive symptoms were not associated with caregiver distress (p>.05).
Conclusions: Findings suggest that self-report and informant-report
may yield different information about a patient’s level of depressive
symptoms. The moderate correlation found between self-reported and
informant-reported depressive symptoms is in line with meta-analytic
findings of self-other agreement for internalizing problems in adults
(Achenbach et al., 2005).

J. CARSTENS & A. BAIRD. Concurrent Validity of the Goal
Management Training Questionnaire – Self in Undergraduates.
Objective: The Goal Management Training Questionnaire – Self
(GMTQ-S) is a self-report questionnaire that was designed to assess
individuals’ difficulties when attempting to achieve goals in their lives.
In particular, it was designed to evaluate the effectiveness of a cognitive intervention called Goal Management Training, created to alleviate

executive functioning (EF) difficulties in a variety of populations. To
this date, this intervention, and thus the GMTQ-S, has not been used
with an undergraduate student population. That being said, undergraduates often experience EF difficulties, albeit of a subclinical level, and
thus we examined the validity of the GMTQ-S with this population.
Participants and Methods: 50 participants with self-reported EF difficulties (that is, difficulties focusing attention, controlling and regulating
distractions, or working towards goals) completed the GMTQ-S and
two measures that have often been used in the literature to assess EF
difficulties (namely, the Robert Morris Attention Scale [RMAS] and the
Behavioral Rating Inventory of Executive Functions – Adult Version
[BRIEF-A]). In addition, participants completed an academic self-efficacy measure (Self Efficacy for Learning Form – Abbreviated Version
[SELF-A]) and reported their previous semester’s GPA.
Results: Several two-tailed Pearson r correlational analyses were performed to investigate the relationship between the GMTQ-S and these
measures. Results indicate significant correlations (p < .05) between the
GMTQ-S and the BRIEF-A (that is, for the Global Executive Composite
score [r = .61], the Behavioral Regulation Index [r = .41], as well as the
Metacognitive Index [r = .65]), the SELF-A (r = -.33), and the RMAS
(r = .57). No significant correlation was found between the GMTQ-S
and students’ GPA.
Conclusions: These results suggest that the GMTQ-S is a valid measure
to use with an undergraduate population when assessing self-reported
executive functioning difficulties.

K.R. CARTER, J. SCOTT, R. ADAMS & J. LINCK. Base Rate
Comparison of Failed RBANS Effort Scale and Effort Index in
Parkinson’s Disease.
Objective: The Effort index (EI) and the Effort scale (ES) are commonly used embedded effort indicators on the Repeated Battery for the
Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS). The ES may have
better sensitivity in detecting suboptimal effort in traumatic brain injury
and amnestic disorders; however, differential findings revealed higher
base rate failures of the EI relative to the ES in Alzheimer’s disease
though not other dementias. The purpose of this study is to examine
the failure rates in a Parkinson’s disease sample.
Participants and Methods: This study included 163 participants who
have been diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease by a board certified neurologist. Twenty of these participants were evaluated for deep brain
stimulation candidacy. Participants completed the RBANS and the Mini
Mental State Examination (MMSE) as part of a comprehensive neuropsychological evaluation. The EI and ES were calculated in accordance
with the published guidelines. The base rate of EI and ES failure was
calculated for the group.
Results: On average, participants were 66.81 year of age (SD=9.5) and
had a mean education of 13.49 years (SD=2.79). The mean for MMSE
scores was 26.97 (SD=3.1). Overall, 62.8% of participants failed the
ES and 8% failed the EI.
Conclusions: The utility of the EI and the ES in Parkinson’s disease
populations warrants further examination. Additionally, these results
demonstrate the need for validation of embedded RBANS effort measures in various disease populations.

M.V. COSTA. Diagnostic accuracy of GDS-15, PHQ-9 and HAMD17 in a community sample of elderly with late life depression.
Objective: The objective is to evaluate the accuracy, determine cutoffs
and reliabiliy for the GDS-15, PHQ-9 and HDRS-17 scales for a community sample of elderly with late life depression

Forty Fourth Annual INS Meeting Abstracts
Participants and Methods: Patients (N=129, 88,4% women) were
invited for participation. They were patients from a secondary/tertiary
public health unit for elderly. Participants range 60 to 92 years of age
(M=71.47, SD= 7,85) and 0 to 26 years of formal education (M=6.71,
SD=4.92).Criterion validity for the GDS-15, PHQ-9 and HAMD-17
was explored withlate life depressio treated as the criterion, exploring
sensitivity and specificity of different cutscores using receiver operating
characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. Presence and absence of depression was determined using patient responses to the Mini-International
Neuropsychiatric Interview.Also the accuracy for diagnostic was compared through the differences between the area under the curves of the
three scale. Internal consistency reliability of the scales was assessed
using Cronbach alpha coefficient and corrected item-total correlation
coefficients.
Results: The area under the curve of the PHQ-9(0.951, SE = 0.023,
p < 0.001)show high accuracy. For the HDRS-17, the area under the
curve was also high in magnitude (0.966, SE = 0.018, p < 0.001) as
well for GDS-15 (0.946, SE = 0.020, p < 0.001). When the areas under the curve of these three independent analyses were compared no
significant difference was found between PHQ-9 and HDRS-17 (Z =
1,239, p = 0,2154),PHQ-9 and GDS-15(Z= 0,265, p=0,7913)or -17
and GDS-15(Z=1,202, p= 0,2294)suggesting the same accuracy. According to the ROC curve analysis, the cutoff close to 6 to GDS-15, to
9 to PHQ-9 and to 9 to HDRS-17 increase specificity and sensitivity in
diagnostic confirmation.
Conclusions: The GDS-15, PHQ-9 and HDRS-17 scales show good
accuracy and reliability for elderly people with late life depression.

C.C. CRANSTON & P.D. BLANTON. Alternate Form of the Trail
Making Test Parts A & B: Preliminary Validation.
Objective: The Trail Making Test (TMT) is one of the most frequently
given tasks in neuropsychological evaluations. Studies have demonstrated clinically significant practice effects as a result of serial administration in- and outside of NP clinics (e.g., speech pathology). A call
has been made for alternate forms. The purpose of the present study is
to provide preliminary pilot data for the validation of alternate forms
of TMT Parts A and B.
Participants and Methods: Data were collected from a clinical sample
of 10 veterans presenting for neuropsychological evaluation. The TMT
and TMT- were administered using counterbalancing to control for
order effects.
Results: Results revealed no significant differences in completion time
and number of errors for either TMT or TMT-R administrations based
on order so all participants’ data were aggregated for subsequent analyses. Correlations were conducted on the total completion time, T-scores,
and number of errors between TMT and TMT-R revealing strong coefficients of equivalence.
Conclusions: Based on findings from this preliminary validation study,
there is a strong degree of equivalence between the original TMT and the
TMT-R. Taken with caution, given the small pilot sample size, results
provide promising evidence for the use of the TMT-R as an alternate
form. Findings are meaningful in that data were gathered on a purely
clinical outpatient sample without exclusion or recruitment criteria and
provide preliminary clinical utility for TMT-R. Findings necessitate a
call for further research in a controlled study using a longer interval
between administrations of TMT-R and TMT.

C.H. STRONG, R. JAROH, H. SMITH & J. DONDERS. D-KEFS
Color-Word and Verbal Fluency Performance after Traumatic
Brain Injury.
Objective: To determine the sensitivity of the various D-KEFS Color
Word and Verbal Fluency subtests to traumatic brain injury and to
examine latent constructs.
Participants and Methods: 128 persons with traumatic brain injury
were evaluated within 30-360 days after injury. The sample included
74 men ad 54 women with a median age of 39 years and a median level
of education of 13 years. Individuals who failed performance validity
tests had been excluded. Spearman correlations and regression analysis
were used to evaluate the influence of various demographic and injury
variables on D-KEFS peformance. Factor analysis was used to evaluate latent constructs of those subtests that demonstrated convincing
evidence for sensitivity to injury severity.
Results: The Color-Word Inhibition/Switching subtest and the Verbal
Fluency Category Switching subtest demonstrated stastically significant
sensitivity to injury severity (specifically, longer duration of coma and
presence of diffuse lesions on neuroimaging) even after controlling for
lower-level subtest performance (i.e., respectively, Color Naming and
Category Fluency). Maximum-likelihood factor analysis with oblique
rotation of these two subtests in conjunction with the 4 factor indices
of the WAIS-IV yielded 2 factors: one was defined by Color-WordInhibition Switching, Verbal Fluency Category Switching and WAIS-IV
Processing Speed, whereas WAIS-IV Verbal Comprehension, Perceptual
Reasoning and Working Memory comprised the other factor.
Conclusions: The D-KEFS Color-Word Inhibition/Switching and
Verbal Fluency Category Switching subtests demonstrate promising
sensitivity to injury severity after traumatic brain injury. Demands on
speed of processing are of relatively greater relevance in this regard then
crystallized skills that are less sensitive to brain injury.

H. DUNCANSON, A. HOLLIS & M.G. O’CONNOR. Errors versus
Speed on the Trail Making Test: Relevance to Driving Safety and
Cognitive Impairment.
Objective: Many studies have examined the efficacy of the Trail Making
Test (TMT) in the prediction of driving safety. There is a lack of consensus across studies regarding the usefulness of this test which may have to
do with diagnostic heterogeneity. In a prior study we demonstrated that
a diagnosis of dementia modified the relationship between MMSE and
driving outcome (Hollis et al., 2015). In the current study we examine
the influence of diagnosis on the relationship between TMT and road
test outcome. A novel error rate calculation is used.
Participants and Methods: 465 participants underwent a driving assessment including a road test. Participants were divided into: those
with Cognitive Impairment (CI; N = 188) and those with No Cognitive
Impairment (NCI; N = 277). CI was based on a diagnosis of dementia
and/or an MMSE score < 25. TMT metrics were speed of completion and
errors calculated according to number of completed items.
Results: In the CI group ROC analyses revealed that TMT- A speed
was more predictive of driving outcome than was TMT- B (AUC =
0.71, p < 0.0001). In contrast, TMT- B error rate predicted driving
competence whereas TMT-A error rate was not useful (AUC = 0.67,
p < 0.0001). In the NCI group, TMT- A & B speeds were marginally
predictive of driving. Error-rate was not predictive in the NCI group
for either TMT- A or TMT- B.
Conclusions: The TMT is more sensitive in the prediction of driving in
individuals with CI than in those who do not have CI. In contrast with
prior research, error rate was calculated based on total items completed
rather than total number of errors. Results indicate that number of items
completed is a sensitive index of driving in the CI group. TMT-A and B
speed and errors were not sensitive to driving outcome in the NCI group.

WAL & K.L. ZANE. The RBANS Factor Structure in Older Adults
with Suspected Cognitive Impairment: Evidence of a 5-Factor
Structure.
Objective: The Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS) is a brief battery of cognitive tests designed to
detect cognitive impairment in older adults. Previous research has not
reproduced the conceptually derived five-factor structure of the RBANS
and has typically yielded two- or three-factor solutions. The present
study investigated the factor structure of the RBANS and hypothesized
that a more complex factor structure could be modeled using more
refined analytical approaches to the data, with a more diagnostically
diverse clinical sample.
Participants and Methods: The present study utilized archival data
from a heterogeneous clinical sample of older adults (N = 150) who
were administered the RBANS as part of a larger neuropsychological
evaluation at an outpatient service. Clinical diagnoses for the sample
included participants with various types of dementia (e.g., Alzheimer’s
type), cognitive impairment without dementia (e.g., mild cognitive impairment), and subjective cognitive impairment (i.e., normal cognitive
functioning).
Results: Four RBANS models were specified using confirmatory factor
analysis. Results of the five-factor model showed excellent fit (GFI =
0.93, AGFI = 0.86, NFI = 0.91, IFI = 0.96, TLI = 0.93, CFI = 0.96, and
RMSEA = 0.07), following modifications to the model. Overall, results
of the chi-square difference test demonstrated that a five-factor model,
consistent to test developer’s five-index structure, was statistically superior to two- and three-factor models (p < .001).
Conclusions: In summary, results from the current study provide support for the theoretically derived five-factor structure of the RBANS in
a heterogeneous clinical sample of older adults, which is in contrast to
previous research. Additionally, our findings indicate that interpretation
of the RBANS at the index level can be clinically meaningful, particularly when there is little discrepancy across subtest scores of an index.

M.E. ENG, J. MOSES & D.A. THOMPSON. Verbal and Nonverbal
Mediation Strategies of the Boston Naming Test.
Objective: Previous research demonstrated that the two-factor model
of the Boston Naming Test (BNT) components are orthogonal and independent (Young, Moses, & Lum, 2014). One of them mediates verbal
information processing, while the other one mediates nonverbal information processing.
The current study aimed to investigate: (1) How the two independent
factorial components of BNT relate to performance level variables of age
and education; (2) How demographically-related components of visual
naming on BNT are related to modular performance pattern components
of intelligence on the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-III (WAIS-III).
Participants and Methods: Archival data of 131 Veterans at the Palo
Alto Veterans’ Affairs Hospital were analyzed with exploratory factor
analyses. A two-factor model of BNT with patient age and education
was used (Young, Moses, & Lum, 2014) showing that performance on
early trials of the BNT loaded with age, while late items loaded with
education. These two factors were reanalyzed with the raw score factorial components of the WAIS-III.
Results: The overall solution explained 86.77% of the shared variance. The early BNT item_age factor loaded with Verbal Comprehension
(VC). The late BNT item_education factor loaded with Processing Speed
(PS) and Perceptual Organization (PO).

Conclusions: These results show that an education-related component
of visual naming ability verbally mediates nonverbal comprehension,
while an age-related component of visual naming mediates verbal comprehension. Attention and working memory were not shown to be correlationally-related to naming ability. These results provide support for
a model that links specific independent components of visual naming to
verbal and nonverbal conceptual reasoning strategies with demographic
variables of age and education.

B. FAUSTO, B. MCINTOSH, C. BONNER & A. MCBRIDE. The utility
of neuropsychological tests and measurement of comorbidity in
predicting driving competence among memory clinic patients.
Objective: The predictive ability of specific neuropsychological measures and the contribution of medical comorbidity to driving competence are unclear. The aims of this study were to identify which traditional neuropsychological measures best predict driving competence
and whether a measurement of comorbid medical conditions improves
predictability.
Participants and Methods: Neuropsychological test (NPT) raw scores,
DriveABLE assessment (DA) performance, and medical history data
were obtained retrospectively from 89 patients who underwent routine clinical care at a memory disorders clinic from July 2008 to July
2013 (mean age = 74.67, SD = 8.44; mean years of education = 14.12,
SD = 2.82; 50 females). The DA, a computer-based tool of driving
competence, has been found to be highly predictive of on-road driving
test performance with higher DA performance scores indicating greater
likelihood of on-road test failure.
Results: Bivariate correlations revealed that poorer NPT performance,
with the exception of Boston Naming Test-60 total score, was significantly associated with higher DA scores. The linear combination of all
NPT predictors, adjusting for age, education and time elapsed between
NPT and DA, significantly predicted DA score (R2 = .623, p < .0005).
Comorbidity did not add significantly to the prediction of DA performance. After backward elimination, Coding and Visual Reproduction
Delayed Recall performance remained significant predictors in the prediction model.
Conclusions: These data suggest that cognitive tests measuring memory
and processing speed inform clinical decision-making regarding driving
competence in a cognitively impaired population. The contribution of
comorbidity to driving competence should be explored in more heterogeneous samples.

R.P. FELLOWS, J. DAHMEN, D. COOK & M. SCHMITTEREDGECOMBE. Multicomponent Analysis of a Novel Digital Trail
Making Task.
Objective: The purpose of this study was to determine the construct
validity of a digital version of the trail making test and to examine the
association of digital component scores with traditional neuropsychological tests.
Participants and Methods: Participants were 60 community-dwelling
older adults who completed a comprehensive neuropsychological evaluation, including a newly developed digital trail making test (dTMT).
Digital component scores were created to identify and isolate specific
cognitive processes involved in trail making test performance. These
component scores included average time inside circle, rate between circles, lifts, and pauses. Construct validity was established by assessing the
correlation of dTMT component scores with other neuropsychological
tests. Exploratory stepwise regression analyses were used to determine
the unique contribution of dTMT components, beyond the effects of total
time and errors, to other neuropsychological measures.

Forty Fourth Annual INS Meeting Abstracts
Results: Results revealed significant correlations of total time to completion for the paper and digital versions of Part A (rho = .601, p <
.001) and Part B (rho = .807, p < .001). Component scores correlated
with measures of psychomotor speed and executive functioning but not
delayed memory recall. After controlling for age, sex, and education,
average time inside circles on Part B was a significant predictor of Design
Fluency Total Score (β = -.498, p < .001), Category Fluency-Switching (β = -.389, p = .002) and Digit Span Total Score (β = -.333, p =
.015). Whereas, dTMT Part A total time was a significant predictor of
performance on the Symbol Digit Modalities Test-Oral (β = -.563, p <
.001) and condition 1 of the DKEFS Color-Word Interference Test (β
= .589, p < .001).
Conclusions: These findings provide initial validation for the construct
validity of a digital trail making task. Moreover, these results further
suggest that the component of average time inside circle captured by
the dTMT may be useful for isolating cognitive switching processes in
older adults.

BRETING. Gender Differences in Item Function on a Common
Clock Drawing Test.
Objective: Clock drawings are commonly used measures of executive
functioning in neuropsychology clinics and research. Performance
on this task may also be influenced by visuospatial skills. Sex differences have previously been found in visuospatial functioning and on a
clock-drawing test. Item and scale-level sex differences have not yet been
investigated on a popular clock drawing task (CLOX: Royal, 1995).
Participants and Methods: Archival data was collected from 578 (303
female) patients who completed the spontaneous clock-drawing task
(CLOX 1) at an adult neuropsychology service. Clock drawings were
scored using the Royal scoring criteria (1995). Sex differences on total
score were examined using independent-samples t-tests. Differences on
item performance were evaluated using logistic regression and likelihood-ratio chi-square tests for uniform and non-uniform differential
item functioning (DIF).
Results: No sex differences were found in total score (t=0.550,
p=0.582); however, likelihood-ratio tests determined that sex differences existed on 7/15 items. Specifically, uniform DIF was found on
5 items (e.g. “Sequence 1-12 Intact?”, p=.008), and non-uniform DIF
was present on an additional 2 items (e.g. “Does the figure resemble a
clock?”, p=.019). Men performed better on 5 of these items and women
performed better on the remaining 2.
Conclusions: The present study investigated scale and item-level sex
differences on a commonly-used clock drawing task. Although men
and women perform similarly in terms of overall score, men perform
significantly better on 1/3 of items. On 2 items, the degree of difference depended on level of impairment. These results support the use of
CLOX with men and women, but suggest that further work is needed to
elucidate the relationships between sex, visuospatial skills, and CLOX
performance.

L.S. HYNAN & M. CULLUM. Comparison of the Texas Assessment
of Processing Speed (TAPS) with Common Neuropsychological
Tests among Older Individuals With and Without Cognitive
Impairment.
Objective: To determine how a brief (60 sec) newly developed digit-symbol transcription task, the Texas Assessment of Processing Speed
(TAPS), correlates with standard measures of global cognition, attention, executive function, verbal fluency, and processing speed.

69
Participants and Methods: 378 community-dwelling subjects with
and without cognitive impairment [normal cognition (NC): n=177; mild
cognitive impairment (MCI): n=102; Alzheimer Disease (AD): n=99)
were administered the TAPS as part of the Texas Alzheimer’s Research
and Care Consortium protocol. Age ranged from 50 to 93 (M=70.06;
SD=9.60) and mean education was 13.05 years (SD=4.58). Pearson
correlations were examined between the TAPS and MMSE, Clinical
Dementia Rating (CDR) Sum of Boxes, WAIS-3 Digit Span, Trail Making Test, Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer’s Disease
(CERAD) list learning, verbal fluency measures (FAS and Animals),
and Boston Naming Test. ANOVA was used to compare TAPS scores
across diagnostic groups.
Results: TAPS scores were significantly related to all standard neuropsychological measures (p <.001). Strong correlations were seen with
the MMSE (r = .70), Trails A (r = -.70), Trails B (r= -.68), CERAD
List Learning (r = .68), Animal fluency (r = .64), and CDR Sum of
Boxes (r = -.61). Significant correlations were also seen with the Boston
Naming Test (r = .56), FAS (r = .51), and Digit Span (r = .41). TAPS
scores significantly differed across diagnostic groups [NC M = 31.32
(SD=7.87), MCI M = 23.77 (SD=7.44), AD M = 16.66 (SD=8.04); F
(2,377) = 115.36, p < .0001].
Conclusions: The TAPS showed significant correlations with standard
neuropsychological tests and was able to discriminate diagnostic groups.
Results provides preliminary support for the validity of this new, brief
measure of processing speed in the assessment of cognitive function
among older individuals with and without cognitive impairment.

Objective: The WAIS-IV and MMPI-2 are widely used together in neuropsychological evaluations, yet little is known about their interrelationships. This study explores the potential role of diverse psychopathology
characteristics in WAIS-IV performance.
Participants and Methods: Referrals for testing (N=114) completed
the WAIS-IV, MMPI-2, Test Anxiety Profile, and Medical Symptom
Validity Test (MSVT) as part of a larger battery.They were screened
for suboptimal effort and self-report invalidity on the MMPI-2. Correlational methods and mean comparisons (MANCOVA) were performed.
Results: A principal components analysis yielded three MMPI-2 higher-order content scale dimensions: Emotional Internalizing Dysfunction
(EID), Emotional Externalizing Dysfunction (EED), and Fright (Fears,
Bizarre Mentation, Health Concerns). Controlling for education effects,
Fright was significantly correlated with WAIS-IV FSIQ (-.298), Verbal Comprehension (-.297), and Processing Speed (-.257), ps < .001.
Mean WAIS-IV score comparisons between low and high Fright scorers
revealed an effect size of about 1.0 on FSIQ, VCI, PRI, and PSI, ps <
.001. The effect was unrelated to a measure of test anxiety. EID and
EED scores were independent of WAIS FSIQ and Index scores.
Conclusions: Two implications of these findings: First, as a general
rule, when examinees are screened for suboptimal effort and self-report
exaggeration, psychological symptoms related to depression, anxiety,
and acting-out tendencies do not appear to have a significant effect
on WAIS-IV performance. Second, psychological symptoms related to
fearfulness, bizarre thoughts, and somatic complaints appear to have a
mild though statistically significant relationship with level of WAIS-IV
performance.

S. KARAS, J. ROBERTS, J.W. ADAMS & C. YUE. Using Item
Response Theory to Evaluate and Improve the Ecological Validity of
Neuropsychological Tests: An Example of Phishing Susceptibility.
Objective: Item response theory can estimate latent abilities based on
observed responses to test items. We demonstrate how the Neuropsychological Assessment Battery (NAB) Judgment test can be used to estimate
the ability level necessary to avoid falling victim to an experimental
phishing attempt.
Participants and Methods: A sample of 122 cognitively intact participants, including older (n=65) and younger (n=57) adults, was recruited
from the local community and university, respectively. Participants were
administered the NAB Judgment test and exposed to an experimental
phishing attempt while using a computer; the 10 Judgment items were
scored on a 3-point scale and the 1 phishing item was coded as binary.
Samejima’s graded response model was used to estimate a judgment
ability z-score for each participant as well as difficulty and threshold
parameters for each item.
Results: The 11 items fit a unidimensional model well (RMSEA =
0.000). The threshold parameter for the phishing susceptibility item
was -3.08, 95% CI [-6.05, -0.12], indicating that those with judgment
abilities approximately 3 standard deviations below average have a 50%
chance of becoming vulnerable to phishing attempts. However, this estimate is extremely imprecise, which indicates a need for higher-quality
items for the estimation of judgment ability. The maximum amount of
information provided by NAB Judgment was approximately 2.60, which
corresponds to an internal consistency reliability of 0.62.
Conclusions: Item response theory can be useful in identifying the
necessary ability level needed to complete real-world tasks. However,
good test information, which is obtained through quality test items,
is needed to accurately estimate item parameters with sufficient precision to be clinically useful. The NAB Judgment test may need to be
supplemented with additional items in order to increase its ecological
validity for phishing susceptibility. More data are needed to evaluate
the NAB Judgment test as a predictor of other real-world health and
safety behaviors.

(<.60), which impacted validity. Generally, scales demonstrated adequate convergent and discriminant validity. All reliability and validity
coefficients were more robust in the CI sample compared to the nCI
sample.
Conclusions: The VNT and ANT are generally valid and reliable measures, although caution should be exercised when using the VNT in
non-impaired samples. Limitations include sample characteristics (e.g.,
sample size, gender ratio).

WAIS-III’s Vocabulary holds as a good measure of pre-morbid
functioning after brain injury.
Objective: To explore the Portuguese version of the Wechsler Adult
Intelligence Scale 3rd edition (WAIS-III) in a series of patients with
brain injury.
Participants and Methods: A mixed neurological sample of 81 brain
injured patients (23 brain tumor, 30 refractory epilepsy pre/post-surgery, 20 subarachnoid hemorrhage, 4 stroke, and 4 traumatic brain
injury) and 81 demographically matched healthy individuals performed
the Portuguese WAIS-III (Wechsler, 2008). T-test for independent samples and ROC curves were used for data analyses.
Results: The mean scaled scores of Vocabulary (p=.402) and Comprehension (p=.427) were similar between groups. On the remaining 11
subtests, the healthy control group had significantly better scaled scores
than the neurological group (p<.05). The neurological and the healthy
control groups’ percentages of scaled scores above six were respectively
94% and 91% for Vocabulary and 85% and 94% for Comprehension.
For the remaining subtests, the percentage of scaled scores above six
ranged from 63% to 81% for the neurological group and from 86%
to 96% for the control group. ROC curves showed the lowest score for
Comprehension (AUC=.527), followed by Vocabulary (AUC=.554). The
remaining AUC scores ranged from .610 to .755.
Conclusions: The results support a long tradition of using Vocabulary
as a measure of pre-morbid intelligence that started with Yates (1956)
and is still in use with WAIS-III (Schoenberg et al, 2011). It also reinforces the cross-cultural interest of this measure.

& K. MCCOY. Auditory and Visual Naming Tests: Psychometric
Properties and Performance Patterns among Veterans with and
without Cognitive Impairment.
Objective: Confrontation naming involves word-finding in response
to visual stimuli and requires a complex integration of perceptual, semantic, lexical, and phonologic abilities that can be affected by myriad
neurologic conditions. Some naming tasks use infrequent stimuli heavily
influenced by educational/cultural factors and have been criticized as
not reflecting day-to-day word-finding. The Columbia Visual and Auditory Naming Tests (VNT & ANT) were created to address these issues.
However, the measures’ psychometric properties have been evaluated in
a single study. The aim of this study was to evaluate their psychometric
properties in an outpatient clinical sample.
Participants and Methods: This archival sample included neuropsychological data for a mixed clinical sample (53% White, 34% Hispanic,
11% Black; 88% male) of 47 veterans without cognitive impairment
(nCI) and 74 with cognitive impairment (CI), with a mean age of 59
(SD = 12) and mean education of 13 (SD = 3). We analyzed scale
descriptives, reliability, and convergent and discriminant validity for
the VNT/ANT. Other measures included the Boston Naming Test-2,
verbal fluency, California Verbal Learning Test-II, Trail Making Test,
and Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-IV.
Results: Results are detailed in tables. Briefly, central tendency and
variance were similar to that in the original study. Several items had
no variance (i.e., everyone obtained a correct score) such that reliability
analysis was limited; the VNT had poor reliability in the nCI sample

C.A. BUSSELL & B.E. GAVETT. Measurement Invariance of the
Latent Dementia Phenotype in the ADNI Dataset.
Objective: Royall and colleagues identified the latent dementia phenotype, δ, which represents the concomitant cognitive and functional
changes of dementia. Given that δ has been validated cross-sectionally
and longitudinally using clinical and neuropathological outcomes in
the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset, it is
important to examine whether δ measures dementia severity equally
across diagnostic groups. This study examines measurement invariance
(MI) of δ in baseline ADNI data.
Participants and Methods: From 1721 participants with baseline
ADNI data, overall model fit for δ was examined in each clinical diagnostic category: healthy controls (n=521), mild cognitive impairment
(MCI; n=864), and Alzheimer’s disease (AD; n=336). MI was assessed
by examining the fit of a model for δ after imposing increasingly rigid
structural constraints across the three diagnostic groups.
Results: δ fit the data well overall (CFI=0.971, RMSEA=0.049) and
achieved configural (factor structure) invariance (CFI = 0.957, RMSEA
= 0.041). Significant reductions in fit were observed when comparing
weak invariance (factor loadings) to configural invariance (χ2 = 276.98,
p < .01). However, model fit was not found to be significantly different
when strong invariance (factor loadings and intercepts) was compared
to weak invariance (χ2 = 284.98, p=.98), and “strong-plus” invariance (factor loadings, intercepts, and means) was compared to strong
invariance (χ2 = 289.17, p=.38). The weak invariance model did not

Forty Fourth Annual INS Meeting Abstracts
fit the data well (CFI=0.931, RMSEA=0.043), with continued poor fit
in the strong and “strong-plus” models (CFI=0.936, RMSEA=0.039).
Conclusions: Results indicate that δ only possesses configural invariance across the three clinical diagnostic groups. The addition of constraints significantly reduced model fit, suggesting that δ may not be
measuring the same construct across samples of patients diagnosed as
cognitively normal and with MCI and AD in the ADNI dataset.

J.A. HOLDNACK, D. TULSKY & A.W. HEINEMANN. Estimating
Premorbid Cognitive Functioning Using the NIH Toolbox Oral
Reading Test.
Objective: Reading tests have been used to estimate expected cognitive
performance due to their relative resistance to the effects of brain injury
and cognitive decline and due to their high correlation with intellectual
functioning.
Participants and Methods: Participants included 855 healthy adults,
ages 18-85 from the NIH Toolbox standardization, additionally, 159
individuals with mild to severe TBI, participating in a large multi-center
research study, were included in this study. All participants completed
the NIH Toolbox Oral Reading Test and fluid subtests.
Results: Reading scores correlated from .65 (Vocabulary) to .21 (Pattern Comparison) for age-adjusted scores. Multiple regression analysis
was used to develop prediction equations for the Fluid Reasoning index
using a combination of reading, education, gender, and ethnicity as
predictors. The prediction equation for age-adjusted scores yielded an
R2=.21 and a prediction range of 76.04 to 120.18. Most scores (> 55%)
were within + 10 points of the actual Fluid Index score and differences
of 14 and 17 points for predicted greater than actual scores occurred in
15% and 10% of the normative sample. In a sample of participants with
TBI, 45% had predicted Fluid Index scores 14 or more points higher
than the actual Fluid Index scores and 37.% had scores 17 or more
points higher. These results suggest that a third or more individuals
with TBI perform below expected levels considering their estimated
premorbid ability.
Conclusions: The NIH Toolbox Oral Reading test can be used as an
estimate of pre-morbid cognitive functioning. The expected rate of predicted versus actual cognitive performance based on the reading test
can be used to identify atypical cognitive functioning in individuals
after TBI.

J.A. HOLDNACK, D. TULSKY, A.W. HEINEMANN, B. BROOKS
& G.L. IVERSON. Multivariate Base Rates for Interpretation of
NIH Toolbox Cognition Tests and Application to Individual with
TBI and Stroke.
Objective: Determine the base rate of low scores on the new NIH Toolbox Cognition battery. Apply the base rates of low scores in healthy
adults to differentiate typical from atypical cognitive functioning in
TBI and Stroke samples.
Participants and Methods: Participants included 855 healthy adults,
ages 18-85 from the NIH Toolbox standardization, additionally, 159
individuals with mild to severe TBI, and 174 examinees with Stroke,
participating in a large multi-center research study, were included in
this study. All participants completed the NIH Toolbox cognition battery
verbal and fluid subtests.
Results: When the 7 tests were considered simultaneously, 52.4% of
the standardization sample had at least one demographically adjusted
t-score ≤16th percentile and 21.4% had at least one ≤5th percentile. For
age-adjusted scores, 50.3% of the standardization sample had at least
one demographically adjusted t-score ≤16th percentile and 21.5% had
at least one ≤5th percentile. For both fully-adjusted and age-adjusted

71
scores, three or more scores at or below the 16TH percentile was observed in only 8% of the standardization sample. In the TBI sample,
71.7% had at least one t-score at or below the 16th percentile and 24.5%
had 3 or more scores at that level. Of the individuals with stroke, 81%
had at least one t-score at or below the 16th percentile and 33.9% had
3 or more scores in that range.
Conclusions: Low scores on a battery of cognitive tests is common in
healthy people and the rate of low scores varies by the cutoff that is
used. The base rates of low scores in healthy adults can be applied to
clinical samples to identify atypical cognitive functioning as measured
by the NIH Toolbox Cognition battery.

of Heavy Drinking and Age on Cognitive Functioning in Veterans
with Posttraumatic Stress Disorder.
Objective: Heavy alcohol use and age are known to have a synergistic
impact on cognitive functioning beyond normal aging effects. We sought
to examine age and heavy drinking effects on cognitive functioning in 52
veterans with PTSD entering a RCT of topiramate treatment.
Participants and Methods: Veterans completed measures of cognitive
reserve, processing speed, mental flexibility, working memory, cognitive inhibition, verbal fluency, auditory-verbal learning and recall,
decision-making, risk-taking, and choice inhibition. Average standard
drinks per week (DPW) were calculated during the 90 days prior to cognitive testing. A four-step hierarchical regression model (HRM) was conducted for each cognitive domain. The following independent variables
were entered at each step: 1) cognitive reserve; 2) DPW; 3) age; and
4) an interaction term of age-by-DPW. Cognitive reserve was trimmed
from the HRMs when it was not significantly associated with cognition.
Results: The HRMs containing the age-by-DPW interaction term
significant predicted performance on working memory [F(4,44) =
5.53, p<.01, R2=.27], auditory-verbal learning and recall [F(4,46) =
3.93, p<.01, R2=.19; F(4,46) = 2.96, p<.04, R2=.12, respectively],
and tended to predict choice impulsivity [F(4,41) = 2.28, p=.08, R2
=.10]. Whereas, only step 2 of the HRM containing DPW significantly
predicted verbal fluency [F(2,48) = 4.04, p<.02, R2=.11]. Multiple
correlations were observed between cognitive reserve, age, DPW, and
the various cognitive domains.
Conclusions: Evidence suggests age and heavy alcohol use has a negative synergistic impact on working memory, auditory verbal learning
and recall, and choice impulsivity. These domains may be potential
targets in developing cognitive training paradigms for aging veterans
with PTSD entering alcohol treatment. Clinicians are encouraged to
consider a standard assessment of cognitive functioning in treatment
planning and delivery for heavy drinking veterans with PTSD.

Psychometric Properties of a Visual Learning and Memory Test:
The Biber Figure Learning Test.
Objective: The Biber-Glosser Figure Learning Test (BFLT) is a nonverbal supraspan learning test analogous to a verbal serial list-learning
test such as the California Verbal Learning Test (CVLT-II). This study
assesses the psychometric properties of the BFLT and provides normative data for older adults.
Participants and Methods: Participants included cognitively normal
older adults (n=166, 72±7, 40% female) from the Vanderbilt Memory
and Aging Project who completed a comprehensive neuropsychological

72
protocol. A principal component analysis (PCA) with variamax rotation was completed to evaluate the BFLT structure. Partial correlations
(adjusting for global cognition) between BFLT and other cognitive tests
assessed convergent and discriminant validity. Bivariate correlations
related BFLT to demographic factors. Normative data was presented
as mean and standard deviation for key BFLT indices.
Results: PCA revealed a 3-component structure (recall, recognition,
interference), accounting for 82% of the total variance. BFLT was
negatively correlated with age (r>0.16, p<0.001) and reading-ability
(r>0.18, p<0.001). Sex, education, and mood were not correlated with
BFLT (all p-values>0.03). BFLT was moderately correlated with CVLT
Immediate Free Recall (r=0.40, p<0.001), Delayed Free Recall (r=0.38,
p<0.001), and Recognition Discrimination (r=0.24, p=0.002) and visuospatial tasks (r>0.23, p<0.002). BFLT was modestly correlated with
measures of executive function (r>0.21, p<0.006), language (r>0.22,
p<0.001), and processing speed (r>0.29, p<0.001). Demographically-adjusted normative data was calculated for BFLT measures.
Conclusions: The current study suggests strong psychometric properties of the BFLT. Demographically adjusted normative data for older
adults will enhance the clinical utility of this visual serial list learning
test for the assessment of MCI and dementia. Greater research is needed
to understand the biological relations and predictive ability of the BFLT.

Examination of cut scores on the validity subscale of the
Neurobehavioral Symptom Inventory in Iraq and Afghanistan
Veterans with a history of mild to moderate traumatic brain injury.
Objective: The Neurobehavioral Symptom Inventory (NSI) is a self-report measure of post-concussive symptoms widely used in Veterans
with a history of mild to moderate traumatic brain injury (TBI). To
identify symptom over-reporting on the NSI, Vanderploeg et al. (2014)
developed the Validity-10 (V-10), an embedded measure of ten unlikely/low-frequency items. Lange et al. (2015) replicated this study in
military service members with a history of mild TBI, and found varying
optimal cut scores of the V-10, distinct from the cutoff recommended by
Vanderploeg et al. The goal of the present study was to determine the
most optimal cut score to alert clinicians to possible symptom over-reporting in Veterans with a history of mild to moderate TBI using the
Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory Second Edition Restructured Form (MMPI-2-RF) as a criterion measure.
Participants and Methods: We examined three V-10 cutoff scores
in 34 Iraq/Afghanistan Veterans with a history of mild to moderate
TBI who underwent a comprehensive clinical neuropsychological exam
including the NSI and MMPI-2-RF.
Results: Using the cut scores of the F-r (Infrequent Responses), Fp-r
(Infrequent Psychopathology Responses), Fs (Infrequent Somatic Responses), FBS-r (Symptom Validity), and RBS (Response Bias Scale)
validity indices in the MMPI-2-RF manual, 38% of Veterans scored
in the invalid range. The V-10 cutoff score of 19 had the best balance
of sensitivity (85%) and specificity (38%) for a screening measure of
possible symptom over-reporting. The positive predictive value was 46%
and the negative predictive value was 80%.
Conclusions: Results indicate that 19 may be the best cutoff score
for Veterans with a history of mild to moderate TBI to alert clinicians
to the possibility of over-reporting post-concussive symptoms. Further
assessment is warranted after a positive screen to confirm the exaggeration of neurobehavioral symptoms as this has implications for the
validity of both symptom and neuropsychological measures in terms of
treatment planning.

Individual Differences in Performance on the Tower of Hanoi and
NASA Task Load Index.
Objective: The NASA Task Load Index (NASA-TLX) has recently
been proposed as a useful assessment in neuropsychology. The present study examines the relationship between number of moves on the
Tower of Hanoi (TOH) and the six subscales (Mental Demand, Physical
Demand, Temporal Demand, Effort, Frustration, and Performance) of
the NASA-TLX.
Participants and Methods: One hundred ninety-five students completed the NASA-TLX after completing each of three counter-balanced
TOH conditions (3-disk, 4-disk, and 5-disk). The six NASA-TLX subscales are on a 0-100 scale.
Results: In all three TOH conditions, greater number of moves was
positively correlated with five subscales of workload (to a lesser degree
in Physical Demand), and negatively correlated with self-perceived
Performance.
Conclusions: In general, these findings show that the NASA-TLX is
sensitive to individual differences in perceived cognitive status during
test performance; the greater number of moves it took to complete the
TOH, the more mentally demanding, temporally demanding, greater
effort, greater frustration, and worse performance one perceived. However, the finding of greater physical demand with more TOH moves, although significantly smaller relative to the other subscales, is somewhat
perplexing. The NASA-TLX has primarily been used in human factors
psychology, and the results of this study suggest that the usage of the
NASA-TLX in neuropsychology could be useful in acquiring additional
information on the cognitive status of the patient.

Population of Dementia.
Objective: The present study describes the use of computer assisted
software to decompose the Trail Making Test.
Participants and Methods: The study, utilizing a large clinical sample
of patients suspected of dementia (n=105), confirms previous studies
with the general population indicating that particular sections require
more time to complete and are more prone to errors.
Results: It was confirmed that patients with mild dementia would do
worse towards the end of the test, patients with moderate dementia
would begin and end the test well, and patients with severe dementia
would begin poorly on the test. It was also confirmed that many patients, immediately after the occurrence of an error, start employing
compensatory strategies which improves their performance on subsequent sections.
Conclusions: The present study suggests that the adaptation of computer assisted testing to clinical practice is an important evolutionary step as it provides clinicians with higher resolution for traditional
measures and discerns the multiple cognitive operations within them,
allowing for the identification of nonspecific error variance that impacts
test performance.

H. MILLER. Assessing the Efficacy of a Cognitive Model on
Concurrent Functional Outcome in Acute Stroke Patients.
Objective: Few studies have examined the relationship between cognition and function in stroke inpatients utilizing comprehensive methods.
This study aimed to compare the efficacy of two models (cognitive
and medical) predicting concurrent functional status across multiple
domains in the early stages of stroke recovery.

Forty Fourth Annual INS Meeting Abstracts
Participants and Methods: Seventy-five acute stroke patients were administered a comprehensive neuropsychological assessment. Functional
domains were assessed using the Mayo-Portland Adaptability Inventory
- 4 (MPAI-4). Hierarchical linear regression was used to compare a medical model comprised of neuroimaging results, co-morbid factors, and
demographic information with a neuropsychological model comprised
of composite scores derived from neuropsychological tests of executive
function, memory, visuospatial-constructional skills, and language. Results were examined for the sample as a whole and after segregating the
sample by stroke location based on the Oxfordshire Community Stroke
Project (OCSP) Classification System.
Results: The neuropsychological model was a significant predictor,
above and beyond the medical model, of MPAI-4 Ability, Participation,
and Total scores. The degree of association varied across functional
domains, and was moderated by stroke location based on the OCSP. In
the medical model, anterior region lesions resulted in greater maladjustment following stroke.
Conclusions: Neuropsychological assessment contributes independently
to the determination of functional status above and beyond medical and
demographic variants of stroke patients in the early stages of recovery.
There appears to be an intricate relationship between cognitive and
functional domains which is moderated by stroke location. In addition,
patients with anterior region strokes may benefit from a formulated
intervention as part of their treatment plan due to greater difficulty
with adjusting to the stroke.

Traumatic Brain Injury, and Depression.
Objective: Several studies have looked at performance on MMPI-2 validity scales (Silva et al., 2013) in electrical injury (EI) patients. Few
studies have explored these measures with EI participants using the
MMPI-2-RF. This study sought to examine similarities and differences
in symptom validity performance in EI participants referred for comprehensive neuropsychological assessment compared to mild traumatic
brain injury (MTBI) and depressed patients with no known neurological
disorders.
Participants and Methods: Participants included EI (N=41; mean
age=41.8, SD=9.5), MTBI (N=33; mean age=44.8, SD=12.1), and
depressed (N=23; mean age=35.2, SD=11.6) patients. MANOVA was
used to evaluate group differences on MMPI-RF validity scales. Invalid
protocols, as defined by the MMPI-RF manual, were excluded.
Results: MANOVA results indicated a statistically significant difference
in validity scores based on clinical diagnosis, F (16,194) =2.17, p<0.05.
Specifically, diagnosis was significantly related to VRIN-r, TRIN-r, F-r,
Fp-r, FBS-r, and K-r. Post-hoc analysis indicated that the depressed
group was significantly higher than MTBI on VRIN-r, TRIN-r, and Fp-r,
but was significantly lower on the FBS-r. The EI group was higher than
the MTBI group on F-r but otherwise these groups were not statistically
different on the validity scales. Finally, the MTBI group scored significantly higher than the other groups on K-r.
Conclusions: These results are generally consistent with past research
indicating similar performance pattern seen in MTBI and EI groups on
the MMPI-2, providing evidence that these groups have similar response
sets to the MMPI-2-RF. Increased reporting of cognitive and somatic
symptoms in EI patients may be a result of different and wider symptom
complaints than those experienced by depressed patients.

Brief Estimate of Seconds Test (BEST): A Pilot Study Examining
Initial Psychometrics and Norms for a New Chronometric Clinical
Test.
Objective: Distortions in timing and time perception are found in multiple neuropsychiatric populations (e.g., Parkinson’s, Huntington’s,
ADHD, TBI, schizophrenia). Dopaminergic and acetycholinergic action within frontotemporal-striatal and cerebellar circuits are associated
with time-perception processes via attentional-monitoring, memory, and
decision/motor control. While theoretically driven research is available,
no widely used, easily administered, and normed chronometric clinical
test currently exists.
Participants and Methods: Thirty-five college students (women=30)
were administered a novel time-estimation test in conjunction with a
post-concussive symptom questionnaire and a mood questionnaire. The
novel measure requires retrospective and prospective estimates/production of two time targets (23 & 53 seconds).
Results: Internal reliability within subtests was adequate for all but one
subtest (α’s = 0.66 to 0.79). Test-retest reliability was moderate-to-high
(r’s = 0.66, 0.74, 0.74, 0.80, p’s<0.01; r=0.40, p<0.05). Correlations
between short and long time estimates were strongly correlated for two
subtests (r’s=0.85, 0.88, p’s<0.01), though not correlated for the most
integrative subtest, which requires participants to reproduce a time
interval. Prospective verbal and production estimates were inversely
related, demonstrating consistent pacing error across different subtests.
Age correlated moderately with two subtests (r’s=0.37, -0.43, p<0.05).
No correlations were found for gender, education, or handedness.
BEST subtests did not correlate with post-concussive or clinical mood
sub-scales.
Conclusions: The BEST demonstrated acceptable psychometrics in a
pilot study. Chronometric performance appeared resistant to sub-clinical cognitive, affective, and behavioral symptoms. Additional normative/psychometric data and clinical comparison group data are being
collected to increase utility (measure and pilot norms available for public
use).

K.E. MCCALLUM, B.E. RIDGE, R.T. CHEIFFETZ, P. STANFORDGALLOWAY & A. SCHMIDT. The Role of Executive Functions in
Externally-Valid Decision-Making Processes.
Objective: The current study examined the contribution of executive
functions (EF) in Need for Cognition (NFC) and Need for Affect (NFA).
NFC and NFA are externally-valid measures of decision-making processes often employed in forensic research. Individuals high in NFC use
an information-focused approach to decision-making. Individuals high
in NFA use an emotion-focused approach to decision-making. Clarifying the cognitive underpinnings of these constructs has relevance for
understanding naturalistic decision-making processes. We hypothesized
that NFC would be positively correlated and NFA would be negatively
correlated with EF.
Participants and Methods: Participants included 124 ethnically diverse undergraduate students (27 males 97 females, mean age = 20
years). All participants completed measures of NFC and NFA and three
tests from the Delis-Kaplan Executive Functioning System (Trail Making, Verbal Fluency, and Color-Word Interference) as part of a larger
neuropsychological battery.
Results: Results of bivariate correlations suggest NFC (α = .29, p =
.001) is positively correlated with Verbal Fluency and NFA (α = -.28,
p = .001; α = -.25, p = .005; α = -.20, p = .024; α = -.20, p = .026) to
be negatively correlated with Color-Word Interference. There were no
significant relationships with Trail Making performance.
Conclusions: Findings suggest individuals high in NFA exhibit more
impulsive tendencies on EF measures suggesting an emotion-based
decision-making approach may be related to problems with cognitive

74
inhibition. Individuals high in NFC exhibit better expressive language
and verbal organizational skills. Potential implications of these findings
to other studies of naturalistic decision-making are discussed.

M. MALLECK & C. ABEARE. Quantifying the Qualitative Aspects
of Affective Word Production on the Emotion Word Fluency Test
in Somatic Anxiety.
Objective: Verbal fluency tasks have largely focused on acquiring
quantitative (i.e., raw number of words) and qualitative (i.e., strategic
retrieval of words) data to characterize individuals. Standard scoring
procedures neglect the characteristics of words produced. Utilizing an
affective category of semantic fluency, qualitative aspects of words can
be examined by using existing lexical norms. The present study will
examine the usefulness of this technique in relation to somatic anxiety.
Participants and Methods: A sample of undergraduate students
(N=74, M age=20.55, 54 females) was recruited. Cognitive and somatic
anxiety were measured using the State-Trait Inventory for Cognitive and
Somatic Anxiety (STICSA; Ree et al., 2008) and affective verbal fluency
was assessed using the Emotion Word Fluency Test (EWFT; Abeare et
al., 2009). Arousal and Age of Acquisition (AoA) norms were used to
assess characteristics of responses.
Results: Results demonstrated negative associations between trait and
state somatic anxiety and modal arousal r’s(23)=-.427, -.424 p=.037,
.039, respectively, state somatic anxiety and arousal min r(73)=-.281
p=.015, and trait somatic anxiety and AoA mean r(73)=-.245 p=.036.
A single negative association was also found between state cognitive
anxiety and modal AoA r(14)=-.620, p=.014.
Conclusions: Quantifiable values attributed to the qualitative aspects
of words reflected biases in affective semantic retrieval, despite no differences in the raw number of emotion words produced. Individuals
with high somatic anxiety retrieved less arousing words and had a less
sophisticated emotion vocabulary. Future research should utilize this
type of methodology in a clinical sample, as it highlights a novel way to
obtain valuable data from the EWFT.

D. MCCABE & B. MERKER. Centralized, Collective,
Neuropsychological Databases: Perceived Value and Feasibility.
Objective: Large-scale, centralized, collective, databases (CCDs)–e.g.,
collaboratively developed repositories of normative and clinical/research
data–could substantially advance the field of neuropsychology (e.g.,
Jagaroo, 2009; Bilder, 2011). Practice organizations (e.g., the AACN
Test Development Group; Nelson, 2014), commercial enterprises (e.g.,
The Meyers Neuropsychology System; http://meyersneuropsychological.
com/), and research groups (e.g., The International Neuropsychological
Normative Database Initiative; http://inndi.org/) have already developed neuropsychological resources and initiatives involving large-scale
databases. The future manifestation of CCDs however, is unclear, as is
the level of interest within the neuropsychological community to participate in such endeavors. The goal of this survey was to gauge interest
and perceived feasibility, regarding the use and development of CCDs.
Participants and Methods: An invitation to complete a web-based
survey (primarily multiple-choice) was distributed to the NPSCYH and
Community-AACN email lists. Participants (N=105) expressed their
views concerning 1) desirability and feasibility of broadly accessible
CCDs, and 2) features that should (and should not) be incorporated
in CCDs.
Results: Over 90% of respondents indicated they would “probably” or
“definitely” be interested in using a scoring CCD and 86.54% would
“probably” or “definitely” be interested in participating in a research

CCD. Most respondents believed that scoring (85.58%) and research
CCDs (89.22%) are feasible, despite concerns (e.g., potential copyright/
publishing issues). Features such as restricted/regulated access were
widely favored (over 90%) whereas respondents were divided on other
features (e.g., requiring minimum testing datasets).
Conclusions: Overall, participants were optimistic about the feasibility
of CCDs, eager to take advantage of these resources, but wary of the
obstacles inherent to their development.

J.J. MIETCHEN & S.D. GALE. Factor Structure and Predictive
Model of the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test.
Objective: Investigate the factor structure of the Rey Auditory Verbal
Learning Test (RAVLT) in a sample of healthy young adults. Specifically, determine whether Trial 1 is, indeed, a measure of working
memory/attention, and whether this predicts overall performance on
the RAVLT.
Participants and Methods: Participants were 66 college age adults
(age=20.9±2.2 years; 56% female). The RAVLT was administered to
the participants following administration protocol. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was conducted to determine the factor structure of
the RAVLT. Structural equation modeling (SEM) methods were used
to determine the predictive value of Trial 1 on other measures of the
RAVLT (e.g., learning, delayed recall).
Results: CFA revealed a three factor model in which Trial 1 represented a single factor (working memory/attention), total score for Trials
1-5 represented a single factor (learning), and short-delay, long-delay,
recognition hits, and recognition false positives together represented
a third factor (long-term memory; β~0.36 – β~0.95, p<0.01). This
model demonstrated good model fit (χ2=0.46, RMSEA<0.001, CFI=1.0,
SRMR=0.06). SEM analyses revealed that Trial 1 had a direct effect on
learning (β=0.67, p<0.001), and long-term memory (β=0.31, p<.05).
However, the direct effect of working memory/attention on long-term
memory is partially mediated by learning, and the direct effect between
working memory and long term memory was no longer significant (β=0.27, p>0.05).
Conclusions: The RAVLT appears to measure similar, but distinct
facets of memory, including working memory/attention, learning, and
long-term memory. Working memory seems to be an important component that contributes to learning and long-term memory performance.
Understanding the factor structure of the RAVLT and appreciating the
importance of working memory/attention in memory processes may
have important implications for clinical interpretation of the RAVLT.

J. DURANT, J. BERG, S.J. BANKS & J.B. MILLER. Comparing the
Test of Premorbid Functioning with the Wide Range Achievement
Test, 4th Ed. Reading Subtest as Estimates of Premorbid Ability.
Objective: Estimating premorbid intelligence is a common component
of clinical evaluations that often relies on reading ability. Two frequently used measures include the reading subtest of the Wide Range
Achievement Test, 4th Ed. (WRAT-4), which converts a raw score to
an age corrected scaled score, and the Test of Premorbid Functioning
(TOPF), which predicts a full scale intelligence quotient (FSIQ) based
on demographic factors and raw reading score. The aim of the present
study was to compare the predictive ability of each of these measures
in a memory disordered sample.
Participants and Methods: Records from 58 consecutive referrals
(Age: M=72.0, SD=9.1; Education: M=15.4, SD=2.8; 60% male) seen
for neuropsychological evaluation as part of routine care in an outpatient
neurodegenerative disorders clinic were reviewed. Measures of interest
included the TOPF, the WRAT-4, and Montreal Cognitive Assessment.

Forty Fourth Annual INS Meeting Abstracts
Discrepancy scores were calculated between estimates and this was correlated with demographic factors and cognitive screening measures.
Pairwise correlations were calculated between raw scores and predicted
intelligence estimates.
Results: Discrepancies between predicted IQ estimates ranged from
-22 to 24 (M=1.4, SD=7.0) and estimates were significantly correlated
(r=.73, p<.001). The difference between WRAT-4 estimated IQ and
TOPF predicted VIQ ranged from -21 to 23 (M=1.1, SD=6.8); these
estimates were also significantly correlated (r=.75, p<.001). Correlations between the difference values, education, and cognitive screening
were non-significant.
Conclusions: The TOPF and WRAT-4 generate highly comparable
predicted intelligence values in a memory disordered sample. Given the
simplicity of the WRAT-4 over the TOPF, it calls the added utility of
the additional demographic information used in the TOPF algorithm
into question.

K.N. MORGAN, B. SCOTT, M. SHEAN, G. ALVAREZ, K. SHADA &
J. CONLEY. Can Lumosity Assessment Tools Provide An Accurate
Snapshot of Executive Functioning? An Independent Investigation
of Test-Retest Reliability and Convergent Validity.
Objective: Neuropsychologists have long recognized the multifactorial
nature of executive functioning (EF), with many executive measures
only weakly correlated with one another. The current pilot study investigated the relationship between Trail Making Test B (TMTB), the
Stroop Color Word Test (SCWT), and their relationship to EF measures
in a computerized cognitive battery. Reliability of the EF subtests was
also examined to further inform validity characteristics.
Participants and Methods: Thirty neurologically healthy participants
between 18 and 35 were recruited from a private college in the Pacific
Northwest. They completed the computerized battery on two occasions,
with one to three weeks between sessions. Of this sample, 14 participants
completed traditional TMTB and SCWT measures during the pre-test
session. Spearman’s rank order correlations were used to determine
test-retest reliability of computerized measures, as well as the relationship between traditional and computerized measures.
Results: Regarding reliability, five out of ten of the computerized measures demonstrated moderate to high correlations (p < 0.01), while two
of the ten reflected moderate relationships (p < 0.05). The traditional
TMTB was moderately correlated with one parallel and one non-parallel
computerized EF measure (p < 0.05). A stronger relationship existed
between conventional and computerized TMTB raw times (r = .685, p
< 0.01). The SCWT was not significantly related to computerized EF
tasks or TMTB task.
Conclusions: Results are consistent with previous studies of EF. Although tasks may evaluate similar factors within the EF construct, the
measures are often weakly correlated. Of concern, however, is the lack
of strong relationships between parallel conventional and computerized
tests in this study, despite a trend toward moderate to strong reliability.
A larger sample is needed to better predict the reliability and convergent
validity of this battery, and ecological validity should also be explored.

C. MULLEN & A.Y. STRINGER. Problem Solving in Space: Factors
Accounting for Short Category Test Performance.
Objective: To better characterize patient performance, we developed
Short Category Test (SCT) perceptual, mental flexibility, and reasoning
indices to supplement the standard total error score.
Participants and Methods: Archived records yielded data on a mixed
neurological sample (11 dementia, 8 epilepsy, 8 stroke, 2 encephalopathy, 5 brain injury, 4 tumor, and 3 other/mixed etiologies; mean

75
of 81 months since onset). A sample majority was female (n=25) and
right-handed (n=37), with mean age 47. The proposed SCT indices were
calculated, and Pearson correlations were computed with hypothetically
related neuropsychological tests, followed by multiple regression analyses when several tests correlated with a single index.
Results: Overall SCT errors correlated negatively with design fluency accuracy (r=-.43, p=.02), while perseverative errors correlated
negatively with verbal fluency accuracy (r=-.50, p=.13), confirming
a relationship between the SCT and mental fluency/flexibility. SCT
categorical reasoning correlated with both phonemic fluency (r=.432,
p=.02) and verbal fluency set loss errors (r=.42, p=.02), with hierarchical regression confirming both variables independently accounted
for significant variance in the reasoning index [t(29)=2.348, p=.03;
t(29)=2.272, p=.03, respectively]. While judgment of line orientation
(r=.38, p=.02), design fluency accuracy (r=.414, p=.03), and Wisconsin
Card Sorting Test sorts (r=-.32, p=.05) correlated with the ability to
judge spatial orientation on the SCT, only the first two of these variables
trended towards significance in subsequent regression analyses.
Conclusions: As predicted, SCT performance is dependent on a combination of perceptual, mental flexibility, and reasoning abilities which
are not adequately captured by simply tallying overall errors. The SCT
indices allow for a fine-grained analysis of results, allowing more precise
characterization of patient performance.

Independence Measure and Common Neuropsychological Tests
in a Stroke Population.
Objective: The Functional Independence Measure (FIM) is a widely
used clinical tool to assess motor and cognitive functional abilities. However, it is unclear how well the cognitive subscale of the FIM (FIMc)
assesses various domains of cognition. This study aimed to assess the
convergent validity of the FIMc and FIM motor subscale (FIMm) with
commonly used neuropsychological (NP) tests.
Participants and Methods: Participants (N=51) were inpatients admitted to a rehabilitation unit following stroke. Functional abilities were
assessed with the FIM, and cognition was assessed with a battery of NP
tests. Convergent validity between the FIM subscales and NP tests was
assessed using Pearson r correlations.
Results: The FIMm significantly correlated with the Color Trails
Test (CTT) 1&2, Rey-Osterrieth Complex Figure Test (RCFT) Copy,
Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale – Fourth Edition (WAIS-IV) Block
Design (BD), Controlled Word Association Test (COWAT) Animals, and
the Grooved Peg Board (Pearson r ranged from .28 to .41, p<.05). The
FIMc significantly correlated with CTT1&2, RCFT (Copy, 3’ delay, and
30’ delay), BD, COWAT-Animals, and GPB (Pearson r ranged from .31
to .56, p<.05). These tests correlated with at least 1, but up to all 5 of
the FIMc items. The Consonant Trigrams, Selective Reminding Test,
WAIS-IV Coding, Wisconsin Card Sorting Test, and COWAT-FAS did
not significantly correlate with the FIMc items or total score.
Conclusions: The FIMm was correlated with most NP tests involving
motor abilities. Correlations between the FIMc and NP tests were mixed.
Notably, the FIMc and its items were not correlated with NP tests of
memory, executive function, or verbal fluency. Results suggest that performance on NP tests measuring memory, executive function, and verbal
fluency do not affect stroke patients at a functional level, or the FIMc
inadequately assesses cognition and may overestimates abilities. More
research is needed to determine how performance on NP tests relates to
real-world functional abilities.

Neuropsychological Test Performance in Adults With Type II
Diabetes.
Objective: Type II diabetes (T2D) is known to be associated with impairments in cognitive functioning, especially in the areas of memory
and executive functioning. Although the mechanisms that drive this
decline in cognitive functioning are multifactorial, poor glycemic control resulting in chronic hyperglycemia has been implicated as a strong
contributing factor. The aim of this study was to determine a) whether
the T2D patients in our sample exhibited poorer neuropsychological test
performance as compared to available norms, and b) whether glycemic
control variables correlated significantly with neuropsychological test
performance.
Participants and Methods: Adults with T2D (N=43) were recruited
from the community. Participants completed a neuropsychological test
battery and biological tests were conducted. Data from 72-hr continuous
subcutaneous glucose monitoring (CSGM) were collected, including average glucose levels, fasting glucose levels, amplitude of glycemic fluctuations, and sustained chronic hyperglycemia. Composite scores for neuropsychological testing were calculated by averaging test scores along
the domains of executive function, memory, and visuospatial abilities.
Results: No correlations existed between glycemic control variables
and neuropsychological test performance or composite scores. However,
impairments in cognitive functioning were present in the domains of
memory (Rey-Osterrieth Complex Figure Test, Buschke Selective Reminding Test List Total, CLTR, LDFR scores) and executive functioning
(Colour Trails Test).
Conclusions: Our sample of adults with T2D had significant cognitive
impairments in memory and executive function. No relationship between poor glycemic control and neuropsychological test performance
was found. Results support previous findings of cognitive deficits in
T2D, but contradictive of the link between poor glycemic control and
neuropsychological test performance. Future research is needed to identify biological factors related to lowered cognition in adults with T2D.

Episode Bipolar Disorder and Schizophrenia.
Objective: The study aimed at utilizing the Sri Lankan validated
Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status
(RBANS) test battery in identifying the relative magnitude of cognitive
deficits in first-episode schizophrenia and bipolar disorder and identify
the specific cognitive domains that are mostly deficit.
Participants and Methods: A total of 130 indivuduals were evaluated
. Neurocognitive functioning of age, gender education matched people
with bipolar disorder (n = 41), schizophrenia (n = 51) and healthy
controls (n = 51) without any history of psychiatric disorder, was compared using analysis of covariance . All participants were administered
the RBANS.The RBANS is a brief, standardised, cognitive screening
instrument which assesses multiple cognitive domains. Data collection
took place at Colombo South Teaching Hospital and National institute
of Mental Health.
Results: A comparison of the three groups showed significant differences on the RBANS total score and all of the measured domains. In all
of the comparisons, the schizophrenia group obtained the lowest scores,
followed by the bipolar disorder group, and then the normal controls
without psychiatric disorder. In the analysis of covariance of RBANS
total scores with the patient samples, the difference between schizophrenia and bipolar disorder remained significant after controlling for
a range of demographic and clinical variables. The bipolar disorder and
schizophrenia groups were most impaired on tests of memory, attention and language. The bipolar group performed significantly better on
tests of coding (speed of processing), verbal fluency and visuospatial/
constructional ability.
Conclusions: Overall, this study demonstrates that both first-episode
schizophrenia and bipolar disorder are associated with significant cognitive impairments, but those in schizophrenia are more severe.

Forms among Clinical Neuropsychologists in the U.S. and Canada.
Objective: Tracking neuropsychological change over time can pose a
challenge due to practice effects that occur when the same instrument is
used more than once with a given patient. Failure to account for practice
effects can lead to erroneous conclusions. One approach to handling
practice effects is the development of alternate/parallel test forms. As
part of a larger study on test usage practices among neuropsychologists,
the current study analyzed data related to neuropsychologists’ reported
utilization of instruments with alternate/parallel forms.
Participants and Methods: Respondents were 512 doctorate-level
psychologists from the U.S. and Canada affiliated with the National
Academy of Neuropsychology and/or the International Neuropsychological Society (25% usable response rate). Participants were asked to
report the frequency with which they use tests with alternate/parallel
forms and list up to four of these tests that they frequently administer.
Results: The overwhelming majority of respondents (95%) reported use
of tests with alternate/parallel forms, however only 23% of these respondents reported frequent use of such measures. Respondents younger than

reported using tests with alternate/parallel forms more frequently than

Performance on the California Verbal Learning Test-II Following
Stroke.
Objective: Previous research has found that stroke patients with unilateral right hemisphere damage (RHD) score significantly below the
normative mean on the California Verbal Learning Test (CVLT). This
study aimed to (1) replicate the previous findings using the second
edition of the test, the CVLT-II, and (2) determine if performance on
the CVLT-II differs by stroke location.
Participants and Methods: Thirty-seven hospital inpatients (mean
age=66.2, SD=12.1) completed the CVLT-II during a neuropsychological evaluation during stroke rehabilitation. Independent samples
t-tests were used to determine if significant differences on CVLT-II
performance were based on stroke location: right vs. left hemisphere
stroke (RHD vs. LHD) and anterior vs. posterior stroke (AL vs. PL).
Results: All stroke patients exhibited deficits on the total recall portion
of the CVLT-II. Those with LHD or PL performed more than 1SD below
the mean (M = 50, SD = 10), while those with RHD or AL performed
within 1SD below the mean. No significant differences were found for
CVLT-II performance between RHD (M=44.96, SD=14.19) and LHD

Forty Fourth Annual INS Meeting Abstracts
(M=39.55, SD=14.41), or between AL (M=44.27, SD=14.24) and PL
(M=38.80, SD=13.19).
Conclusions: Previous findings of RHD stroke patients performing close
to 2SD below the mean on the CVLT were not found here. This may be
due to the relatively updated normative database of the CVLT-II. Results suggest that the CVLT-II is not able to differentiate stroke location
based on test performance. Future research should be directed towards
determining if other commonly used verbal learning tests are sensitive
enough to discriminate verbal memory performance in stroke patients.

M.J. TAYLOR & R.K. HEATON. Characterizing Heterogeneity in
Normal Neurocognition.
Objective: In studies where healthy individuals have been compared
with patients, “normal neurocognition” has been assumed to constitute
one large homogenous group and modeled using a flat neuropsychological profile. The current project tests this assumption by examining
individual differences in absolute and relative neurocognitive profiles.
Participants and Methods: The neuropsychological profiles of neuromedically-healthy individuals were characterized using latent profile
analysis (LPA) on a normative dataset of the expanded Halstead-Reitan
Battery (eHRB). The neurocognitive domains underlying performance
on the eHRB were characterized and quantified using exploratory and
confirmatory factor analyses. Two LPAs were conducted on composite factor scores that were corrected for demographics (absolute profiles) and for both demographics and general cognitive ability (relative
profiles).
Results: The first LPA revealed individual differences in overall level
of ability, with some individuals simply performing better than others
across eHRB neurocognitive factors (i.e., working-memory, fluency, verbal memory, language, visuospatial cognition, perceptual speed, and
perceptual attention). The second LPA revealed patterns of individual
differences described by four pairs of latent classes with opposite relative
strengths and weaknesses. Moreover, these latent classes were found
to lie on a two dimensional continuum, characterized using principal
component analysis by verbal-to-perceptual and analysis-to-attention/
speed bipoles.
Conclusions: When demographic characteristics are controlled, individual differences in normal neurocognition are dominated by general
cognitive ability. However, at equivalent levels of general cognitive ability, latent classes of individuals are distinguished, which can be further
characterized by relative tradeoffs along two almost orthogonal bipolar
dimensions: verbal-to-perceptual and analysis-to-attention/speed.

develop dementia.
Results: Ninety participants (52.63%) developed incident dementia
(4.93±3.25 years between test and mild date). A Cox regression was
performed and, after removing stroke/PD subjects, accounting for the
survival time (time until date of diagnosis), and controlling for age at
NP test and education level, we found a significant difference between
groups for incorrect placement of the minute hand (HR=1.855; p<.05).
That is, those participants who eventually developed dementia were
more likely to misplace the minute hand at the time in which they were
deemed not to be demented.
Conclusions: This finding suggests that the CDT error ‘minute hand
not to correct number’ could serve as a preclinical marker of dementia.

Time: Digital Clock Drawing in the Framingham Heart Study.
Objective: The Digital Clock Drawing Test (dCDT) permits objective
assessment of cognitive behavior that may reflect brain integrity. The
current research defines the novel metric ‘percent intra-component
think time’ and its potential clinical application.
Participants and Methods: 726 stroke- and dementia-free participants from the Framingham Heart Study (age=67.85±9.61; education=15.52±3.15; MMSE=28.84±1.43; 47.5% women) were administered the dCDT to command and copy with hands set for “10 after
11”. Four age groups were constructed: 50s, 60s, 70s, and 80s+. dCDT
parameters included total time to completion, total drawing time or
‘ink time’, total non-drawing or ‘think time’, and four intra-component
latency measures of decision-making: (1) post clock face circle latency,
(2) pre 1st hand latency, (3) pre 2nd hand latency, and (4) inter-digit
latency. ‘Percent intra-component think time’ was calculated as: the
sum of the four intra-component latencies divided by total ‘think time’.
Results: In the command condition, total time to completion was longer
for 80s+ than other groups (post hoc test; p<.01). In the copy condition
total time to completion was longer for 70s and 80s+ than other groups
(post hoc test; p<.01). For both command and copy, total drawing time
(ink) comprised 35-40% of total time to completion, and non-drawing
time (think) comprised 55-60%, with no age group differences. Total
intra-component latencies accounted for approximately 30% of total
‘think time’. No group differences were observed.
Conclusions: The ability to measure precisely latencies during shifts
in task demands affords opportunity to measure key decision-making
components. Proportionally longer time spent making decisions (‘percent intra-component think time’) may reflect cognitive deficits even
in normal appearing drawings. Longitudinal changes in ‘percent intra-component think time’ should be explored as a potential cognitive
biomarker for emerging illness.

and Graphomotor Decision Making by Age Group: Framingham
Heart Study.
Objective: The Digital Clock Drawing Test (dCDT) permits precise,
reliable, and objective assessment of key cognitive constructs. These
measures may be used to track early emerging neurocognitive decline.
We determined the effect of age on drawing characteristics and a novel
metric of dCDT decision-making, termed intra-component latencies.
Participants and Methods: 726 stroke- and dementia-free Framingham Heart Study participants (age=67.85±9.61; education=15.52±3.15;
MMSE=28.84±1.43; 47.5% women) were administered the dCDT to

78
command and copy with hands set for “10 after 11”. Total strokes,
total time to completion, and four intra-component latency measures
of decision-making were computed: (1) post clock face circle latency,
(2) pre 1st hand latency, (3) pre 2nd hand latency, and (4) Inter-digit
latency. Four age groups were constructed: 50s, 60s, 70s, and 80s+.
Education and MMSE performance were co-varied.
Results: All following post hoc tests for age group comparisons were
significant at p<0.05. In the command condition, 80s+ participants
required more total strokes and total time to completion compared to
other groups. Inter-digit latency was longer for 70s compared to 60s;
and 80s+ compared to 50s and 60s. In the copy condition, 80s+ required
more total strokes than 50s and 60s; and the 70s and 80s+ groups had
slower total time to completion compared to younger groups. Post clock
face circle latency, and pre 1st hand latency were longer for 80s+ compared to 50s and 60s; inter-digit latency was longer in 80s+ compared
to other groups.
Conclusions: Age group differences are detectable on a standard neuropsychological test in cognitively intact individuals. More strokes and
longer decision-making latencies in copy versus command drawings may
reflect greater use of working memory and/or increased self-monitoring
behavior in older subjects.

A. POLEVOY, C. BREWER & M.I. OSTER. Utility of the RBANS
in Detecting Cognitive Impairment in Alcohol Use Disorders: A
ROC Study.
Objective: The neurotoxic effects of alcohol on the brain are well established; however, substance abuse treatment facilities do not always
administer neuropsychological tests to assess cognitive impairment. The
study examined the diagnostic accuracy of the RBANS in predicting
cognitive deficits. The researchers hypothesized participants with AST
and ALT elevations would score significantly lower on measures of
visuospatial skills, attention, immediate and delayed recall, and total
score on the RBANS.
Participants and Methods: The study included 45 adult alcohol abusers receiving inpatient detoxification treatment. As part of joining the
program at Keys to Recovery (Des Plaines, IL), the participants were
assessed using a brief neuropsychological test battery. The researchers
utilized a ROC analysis to evaluate the diagnostic utility of the RBANS.
Results: Scores were systematically calculated at various levels and
found AST > 90 IU/L and ALT > 100 IU/L are the most accurate
cutoff points. Attention, visuospatial, and total score modestly predict
cognitive impairment. Further, 1 SD below the mean yields moderate
predictive validity measures (SE = 0.75 SP = 0.70). Results indicate
modest scores for immediate memory and attention and moderate sensitivity and specificity for total score 1 SD below the mean (SE = 0.833
and SP = 0.641). Language (AUC = 0.45) and delayed memory (AUC
= 0.59) domains yielded statistically insignificant measures of predictive
validity.
Conclusions: Findings support the clinical utility of the RBANS in detecting cognitive impairment. RBANS is modestly effective in assessing
impairment related to immediate memory, attention and visuospatial
skills. Total score provides a moderate tradeoff between sensitivity and
specificity; it predicts global cognitive deficits associated with chronic
alcohol abuse. Findings suggest a cutoff of 1 SD below the mean is most
sensitive in determining cognitive impairment. Contrary to the initial hypothesis, the RBANS is not sensitive in predicting delayed recall deficits.

E.E. QUASNEY, J.R. WIENER & M.W. HAUT. Neurobehavioral
Examination Performance and Motor Intrusion Errors in Mild
Cognitive Impairment versus Dementia.
Objective: The Neurobehavioral Examination (NBE) was developed as
a rapidly administered screening measure of broad cognitive function,
with a specific focus on identifying signs of frontal lobe dysfunction.
The exam combines components of the neurologic exam with procedures
that assess motor, motor executive, sensory, visual, language, attention/
working memory, and memory. We investigated performance on the
NBE in individuals with MCI and dementia and examined the association between group membership (MCI versus dementia and Alzheimer’s
disease versus other dementia syndromes). We also examined a specific
error type, motor intrusions, on a go/no-go task.
Participants and Methods: ANCOVAs controlling for age, education,
and WRAT-4 Word Reading Standard Score were conducted to examine
differences between groups (MCI N=60, Dementia N=47; Alzheimer’s
N=18) on various NBE scores. Chi-square was used to examine the
association between group membership and the presence of a motor
intrusion on a go/no-go task.
Results: Significant differences emerged in Total NBE Correct, F(1,101)
= 48.10, p < .001, ηp2 = .323; Total NBE Errors, F(1,101) = 22.48,
p < .001, ηp2 = .182; and Total NBE Score, F(1,101) = 49.41, p <
.001, ηp2 = .329, with better performance in the MCI group than the
dementia group on all NBE variables. Chi-square analysis revealed that
motor intrusions occurred more frequently in dementia than MCI, χ2(1)
= 7.58, p = .006, and more frequently in Alzheimer’s disease than other
types of dementia, χ2(1) = 6.43, p = .013.
Conclusions: Results suggest that individuals with MCI perform better
than individuals with dementia on the NBE overall, thus supporting
its diagnostic utility. Motor intrusions occur more frequently among
(1) individuals with dementia relative to MCI and (2) individuals with
Alzheimer’s disease relative to other dementia syndromes.

Predicting Variance in Neuropsychological Test Performance
from Heart Rate and Anxiety.
Objective: Neuropsychological evaluations can be high stakes situations
requiring complex performance on unfamiliar tasks. This has the potential to cause elevations in anxiety, but the impact of this anxiety on
neuropsychological test performance is not well understood. Few studies
have included both self-report and physiological measures of anxiety.
Thus the current study measured both heart rate and self-reported anxiety levels. It was hypothesized that test performance would follow a
curvilinear pattern as heart rate and anxiety increased, especially for
the most difficult tasks.
Participants and Methods: Final analyses included 48 participants
split evenly into an anxiety induction and a control group to encourage a broader range of anxiety levels. All participants completed the
PASAT, the Stroop Test, the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test, the
Trail Making Test and the State/Trait Anxiety Inventory. Heart rate
and blood pressure were recorded during each measure. Performance
on each measure was predicted using three hierarchical regression equations; a linear and curvilinear relationship with heart rate, and one that
combined curvilinear heart rate, STAI, condition, and blood pressure.
Results: Results varied with each measure. Working memory dependent
tasks on the RAVLT and PASAT demonstrated a curvilinear relationship with heart rate following a u-shaped pattern. Performance on the
Interference portion of the Stroop Test demonstrated a linear relationship. Self-report measures of anxiety were not related to performance.
Conclusions: Heart rate is predictive of performance on neuropsychological measures, primarily in those reliant on working memory. However, the direction of this relationship was unexpected as performance
followed a u-shaped rather than hill-shaped pattern. This may capture

M. REYNOLDS, B. CLARK & S. HALL. A Significant Threat to
Neuropsychological Test Validity.
Objective: Neuropsychological test security is vital to the validity of
assessment. Previous research in our lab has shown that 71% of participants use the Internet to prepare for neuropsychological evaluations.
We investigated the availability of information related to neuropsychological tests on the Internet, a topic that has received little attention in
the research literature.
Participants and Methods: First, we decided a priori that we would not
reveal the terms used in this Internet search, as to not contribute to the
problem of threatened test security. We used the Internet search engine
“Google” to begin a search using a general question that a person with
no neuropsychological expertise might use to access initial results. We
obtained 899,000 results for this question. We then selected the first
five search results. One link provided us with a list of 52 commonly used
neuropsychological tests. This list also included information about the
type of cognitive information that the test was meant to assess. Lastly,
we searched for these tests on Google Images and YouTube to investigate
the extent of the information available.
Results: The protocols for 43% of the 52 tests were available on Google
Images. At least partial administration demonstrations were available on
YouTube for 54% of the 52 neuropsychological tests. These demonstrations revealed the test protocols and basic strategy of the tests.
Conclusions: A substantial amount of information regarding neuropsychological tests is available on Google Images and YouTube, threatening the validity of these tests. Individual practitioners may want to
consider this when obtaining informed consent and history taking. It is
recommended that professional neuropsychological associations begin
to develop guidelines regarding appropriate content for websites and
identify and continuously monitor websites that contain threatening
information.

Neuropsychologists’ Expectations are High for Poor Cognitive
Performance in Recreational Cannabis Users.
Objective: Empirical findings regarding the cognitive effects of cannabis are equivocal at best, and a recent meta-analysis found little or no
effect of cannabis on cognition (Shreiner & Dunn, 2012). Stereotype
threat, which Looby and Earleywine (2010) observed in cannabis users,
is one explanation for the variable findings. Similarly, the examiner
may introduce stereotype threat into the testing environment, affecting
cognitive performance. The present study examined evidence for the
perceived cognitive effects of medicinal and recreational cannabis use
within a sample of neuropsychologists (i.e., experts on cognition).
Participants and Methods: We sent an online survey to members of
the National Academy of Neuropsychology (NAN) and the International
Neuropsychological Society (INS). Respondents (N = 261) rated vignettes according to their beliefs about the potential cognitive effects of
recreational and medicinal cannabis use (e.g., in patients with insomnia,
anxiety, multiple sclerosis, or cancer) across nine domains: FSIQ, attention, memory, executive functioning, language, visuospatial functioning, motor functioning, processing speed, and effort. Recreational and
medicinal vignettes were matched with regard to method of ingestion
(e.g., pipe, joint), frequency of use, and duration of use.
Results: Prior to using paired sample t-tests to compare responses on
corresponding vignettes, the estimated effects of medical disorders alone
were subtracted from medicinal vignettes. Recreational cannabis users

79
were rated as having greater cognitive impairment when compared to
medicinal cannabis users (p < .001) across all nine cognitive domains.
Conclusions: Results suggest that neuropsychologists estimate greater
cognitive impairment in recreational cannabis users relative to medicinal cannabis users, despite a lack of empirical support to confirm the
negative cognitive effects of cannabis. Thus, future research should
utilize a design in which examiners are blind to user status to prevent
the potential effects of stereotype threat.

A.S. ROSENBLATT, N.J. PASTOREK, B. MILLER, J. ROMESSER,
A. SIM & J. LINCK. Evidence for Clinical Utility of
Neuropsychological Data Despite Performance Validity Failures.
Objective: Performance validity tests (PVTs) have been shown to explain significant variability in neuropsychological test performance.
However, patients with poor PVT performances often perform in the
normal range on some measures, suggesting greater nuance is needed
when predicting how performance invalidity impacts individual neuropsychological tests. The purpose of this study was to examine neuropsychological test performances by both the number and the level of
failure on PVTs.
Participants and Methods: 180 OEF/OIF/OND Veterans with a history of mTBI were seen for neuropsychological evaluation. The study
sample was 95.6% male with a mean age of 31.5 years (SD=6.3) and
mean education of 13.1 years (SD=1.6). Effects of number and level
of PVT failures were examined on a comprehensive set of neuropsychological test scores, dichotomized as at-or-above the normal range
(i.e., intact) by a cut z-score of -1.0. PVTs included WMT, TOMM,
RDS, CVLT-II FC, and Rey-15, each with empirically supported cut
scores. Nonparametric tests were used to examine the relation between
neuropsychological tests scores and number and level of PVT failures.
Results: Of those failing at least one PVT, 33.9% showed intact performance on at least two-thirds of neuropsychological measures (median
failed PVTs=2). Significant negative correlation was confirmed between
neuropsychological performance and number of PVTs failed (Kendall’s
tau=-.38). Of those below recognized cut scores but above chance-levels
on the WMT and TOMM, 53.6% and 51.0% showed intact performance on at least two-thirds of neuropsychological measures. Lower
PVT scores were also associated with more impaired scores.
Conclusions: This study showed that although PVT failures relate
to neuropsychological performance, intact neuropsychological performances may occur frequently depending on number or level of PVT
failures. While intact performance may not accurately represent one’s
true cognitive potential in the context of PVT failure, testing may still
help rule out frank impairment.

J.A. ROWLAND, H.M. MISKEY, T.W. BREARLY, S.L. MARTINDALE
& R.D. SHURA. Construct Validity of Auditory Consonant
Trigrams.
Objective: Auditory Consonant Trigrams (ACT) was initially developed to test immediate memory decay when rehearsal is prevented by
a distractor task. Subsequent studies have suggested the test measures
aspects of executive functioning, though few studies have empirically
evaluated the construct validity of the ACT. The purpose of this poster
is to present construct validity results of the ACT using a sample of
post-deployment Veterans.
Participants and Methods: For this study, 184 participants who
completed a standardized battery of neuropsychological measures were
evaluated. All participants passed the Word Memory Test and denied
a history of moderate or severe traumatic brain injury (TBI). The relationship between ACT performance and demographic characteristics,
history of mild TBI, and psychiatric disorders was tested with group

80
mean comparisons. Construct validity was explored by examining the
relationship of the ACT to 12 tests of processing speed, attention, verbal
memory, and executive functioning using regression analysis.
Results: ACT Total score reliability was adequate (α = .79). Performance on the ACT was related to education, estimated premorbid intellectual ability, and current major depressive disorder (MDD). Hierarchical linear regression suggested education (β = .17), estimated intellectual
functioning (β = .27), and psychomotor speed (β = -.20) significantly
predicted ACT performance. Results from post-hoc backwards stepwise
regression using the same variables suggested significant relationships
among the ACT Total score and years of education (β = .14), WTAR
(β = .30), Trails A (β = -.18), WAIS-III LNS (β = .16), and CPT-3
Commissions (β = -.15).
Conclusions: This study demonstrates that the ACT has adequate
psychometric properties. Education, intellectual functioning, and psychomotor speed were most salient to ACT performance. Additionally,
those with MDD showed significantly lower ACT Total scores, perhaps
secondary to slowed processing speed.

S. ROYE, M. CALAMIA, K. GREVE, K. BIANCHINI,
L.E. AGUERREVERE & K.L. CURTIS. Booklet Category Test:
Factor Structure and Neuropsychological Correlates in a Mixed
Clinical Sample.
Objective: The Booklet Category Test (BCT) is widely used to assess
executive functioning (Rabin et al., 2005). Previous research has investigated the factor structure of the BCT and found three distinct factors:
“Counting”, “Spatial Positioning” and “Proportional Reasoning” (Johnstone, Holland, & Hewett, 1997). This study explored the relationship
between BCT factors and a battery of neuropsychological measures
given to a mixed patient sample.
Participants and Methods: 137 patients (n=77 TBI, n=30 stroke,
n=30 other psychiatric or neurological diagnoses) who were classified as
giving adequate effort in a previous study (Greve et al., 2007) completed
the BCT and a number of neuropsychological tests.
Results: An exploratory factor analysis yielded a similar solution to
the previous three factor model (Johnstone et al., 1997). Participants
made few errors on the Counting subtests (subtests 1 and 2) reducing
the degree to which that factor could correlate with other variables.
Scores on the Spatial Positioning (subtests 3, 4, and 7) and Proportional
Reasoning (subtests 5 and 6) factors were similar in the magnitude of
their relationship to other measures of executive functioning: Wisconsin
Card Sorting Test total errors (r(134) = .41, r(134) =.42, both p<.05);
Stroop Color-Word performance, r(109) = -.37, r(109) = -.30, both
p<.05; phonemic fluency, r(130) = -.36, r(130) = -.36, both p<.05).
The factors were also similar in the magnitude of their relationship
with other measures (e.g., WAIS-III FSIQ, r(136) = -.49, r(136) = -.46,
both p<.05).
Conclusions: Findings replicate and extend previous research supporting the BCT as a multidimensional test whose factors significantly correlate with a number of other neuropsychological measures (e.g., Allen et
al., 2006). Given errors are made primarily on the Spatial Positional and
Proportional Reasoning factors, the similarities between those factors in
the size of their correlations with other measures supports the continued
use of the total error score in clinical practice.

S.L. SALINAS & S. PENNA. Older Patients Who Present With
Comorbid Depression and Cognitive Complaints: Why Full
Neuropsychological Testing Is Recommended.
Objective: The current study examined performance on a screening measure for cognitive impairment as well as traditional neuropsychological

measures in older veterans with suspected cognitive impairment with
and without depression.
Participants and Methods: All participants are veterans referred to
a Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) clinic due to reported concerns
of cognitive decline. As part of their work-up in the clinic, veterans
underwent neuropsychological battery, cognitive screening measures,
and medical work-up from a geriatric physician. Twenty-six of the 93
patients who completed neuropsychological testing endorsed clinically
significant rates of depression on the BDI-2 (cut off score of 20). Using
t-tests with Bonferroni correction, the current study evaluated whether
or not veterans with depression did more poorly on neuropsychological
testing than those who were not depressed.
Results: Scores on the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MOCA), a
screening measure of cognitive impairment, were negatively impacted
by those who reported moderate to severe depression. t(39.35)=1.96,
p=.057. However, no differences were detected between depressed and
non-depressed veterans on standardized neuropsychological measures
assessing specific cognitive domains (e.g. memory, attention, executive
functioning).
Conclusions: In a rapidly aging population, quick, efficient screening
measures of cognitive decline are increasingly relied on when assessing
for cognitive impairment. As the data here indicate, traditional neuropsychological measures do not appear to be affected by patient’s emotional state. However, global screening measures such as the MOCA are
more influenced by a patient’s emotional functioning. Thus, patients
who present with comorbid depression and cognitive complaints would
be better served to undergo full neuropsychological testing to rule out
depression/pseudodementia versus an actual neurodegenerative process.

Characteristics of Emotion Word Fluency Test Responses and
Depression in Healthy Young Adults.
Objective: The literature suggests that individuals with depression perform similarly to controls on tasks of phonemic fluency, but demonstrate
deficits on tasks of semantic fluency (Henry & Crawford, 2005). Semantic fluency tasks have yet to be investigated in terms of an affective
category (i.e., emotions). This type of measure may be particularly
relevant to individuals with affective disorders, such as depression.
Participants and Methods: A sample of undergraduate students
(N=102, Mage=21.9, 89 females) was administered the Beck Depression
Inventory (BDI-II; Beck et al., 1996) and the Emotion Word Fluency
Test (EWFT; Abeare et al., 2009), in which participants are required to
generate as many emotion words as they can in one minute.
Results: The relationship between BDI-II scores, age of acquisition
(AoA), and the arousal characteristics of words were calculated. Results
demonstrated associations between BDI-II scores and AoA variables
r(102)=-.203, p=.04. There was also a negative correlation between
BDI-II scores the number of words with calm arousal ratings, r(101)=.197, p=.05.
Conclusions: Regardless of depression scores, emotion semantic fluency was not disrupted in this sub-clinical sample. However, the age
of acquisition and arousal characteristics of the words generated by
individuals reflects the underlying differences in affective semantic
retrieval. Individuals with higher levels of depression demonstrated a
less sophisticated emotional vocabulary and a more highly arousing
semantic memory bias, which manifested as a lack of production of low
arousing, calm affective words. Future research should examine these
relationships in a clinical sample.

J. UPSHAW, M. LIBBEN & H. MILLER. The Efficacy of
Neuropsychological Assessment Composite Scores as a Predictor
of Discharge Destination After Stroke.
Objective: Comprehensive assessment of cognitive domains following
stroke may better predict independent (IND) or dependent (DEP) discharge destination from hospital than single neuropsychological tests.
This study aimed to determine (1) if composite scores for memory,
visuospatial abilities, and executive functioning better predict discharge
destination than individual neuropsychological tests, and (2) which cognitive domain (memory, visuospatial abilities, and executive functioning) is the strongest predictor of IND or DEP discharge from hospital.
Participants and Methods: Sixty-two stroke inpatients (IND=24,
DEP=38) were seen for neuropsychological assessment during acute
rehabilitation. Composite scores were calculated by averaging T-scores
of the tests comprising the respective cognitive domains. The relationship between composite scores, individual test scores, and discharge
destination was examined using logistic regression, independent samples
t-tests, and ANOVAs.
Results: In the composite score model (R2=0.50), only the memory
composite (MC) (B=-0.09) was an independent predictor. In the individual test model (R2=0.22), the RCFT-Copy (B= 0.06), WCST-PE (B=
0.14), and WCST-Categories (B= -0.13) were independent predictors
(p < .05). The MC, RCFT-Copy, and WCST Categories were greater
in the IND group than the DEP group, while scores for the WCST-PE
were greater in the DEP group.
Conclusions: These findings demonstrate that (1) the RCFT-Copy,
WCST PE, WCST Categories, and MC can accurately predict discharge
destination (IND or DEP) for stroke patients. There was no indication
that composite scores better assess cognitive abilities to predict IND or
DEP discharge destination. Findings do indicate that MC is a stronger
predictor of discharge destination (IND or DEP) than visuospatial abilities, and executive functioning.

E. SEGAL, D.Z. PRESS & M.G. O’CONNOR. The Clinical Utility of
the Boston Naming Test as a Measure of Semantic Memory.
Objective: We examined the utility of the Boston Naming Test (BNT)
as a test of semantic retrieval by comparing it to other tests designed to
assess semantic access. Originally conceived to detect anomia in aphasic
individuals, the BNT has been appropriated to assess loss of semantic
knowledge suggestive of memory dysfunction in non-aphasic individuals
as it has a semantic memory component. It has clinical application, for
example, in diagnosing Mild Cognitive Impairment and Alzheimer’s Disease. Forgetting the names of everyday objects is a common presenting
symptom complaint in individuals with these disorders. However the
suitability of using the BNT on a wider population than for which it was
originally designed merits investigation.
Participants and Methods: Neuropsychological data from 100 subjects
(45 female, 55 male; age range = 26-87, mean age = 64 yrs ±12) were
analyzed with simple linear regression. We wanted to determine whether
age and education would have similar effects on BNT scores, phonetic
and semantic fluency scores, and long-delay retention scores.
Results: (1) Age accounted for 10% of the variance in semantic fluency
scores and 16% of long-delay retention percent-correct scores, but only
1.3% of BNT scores and 0.5% of phonetic fluency scores; (2) education
accounted for 10% of the variance of phonetic fluency scores, 4% of the
variance of percent-correct long-delay retention scores, 5% of semantic
fluency scores and 4% of BNT scores.
Conclusions: Age was less of a factor on the BNT than expected given
the known impact of age on other semantic retrieval tests. While the
BNT is used widely to assess naming problems, it also serves as a proxy
of semantic loss arising from medial temporal lobe degeneration, and
opportunity exists to redesign the test to increase its utility as a test

81
of semantic loss by making sure age is a relevant variable that is accounted for.

Relationship Between Demographic Variables and Performance
on a Newly Developed Remote Memory Test of Famous Name
Discrimination.
Objective: We previously reported findings for a newly developed remote memory measure, the Famous Name Discrimination Test (FNDT),
which compares the discrimination of the names of well-known public
individuals from remote and recent time periods. For example, a Mild
Cognitive Impairment (MCI) group showed poorer performance than
a healthy control (HC) group for identifying recent famous names, but
not remote famous names. Baseline performance was also a significant
predictor of cognitive decline 18 months later in a group of HC, and an
MCI group showed further decline in discrimination performance after
18 months for both recent and remote famous names. Here, we present
findings on the relationships between age, education, and gender and
the performance of older adults on the FNDT.
Participants and Methods: 247 cognitively-intact participants, aged
65-90 (M = 74.06, SD = 5.43), 70% female, with fifteen years of average education were administered the FNDT, which is composed of
30 famous and 30 unfamiliar names. There were 10 recent (less than
10 years of public exposure) and 10 remote famous names (at least 40
years from initial fame). Names were presented on a computer screen
for 4 seconds. Accuracy and response time (RT) were recorded via
button press.
Results: Remote famous names (96.23%) were identified significantly
more accurately and faster (by about 200 msec) (t = 3.50, p = .004) than
recent famous names (84.85%; t = -4.84, p < .001). Age, education and
gender were not significantly correlated with discrimination accuracy
or RT for recent or remote famous names (p’s > .05).
Conclusions: These findings indicate a minimal impact of basic demographic variables on FNDT performance in older adults. This finding is
an important consideration for the use of the FNDT in a clinical setting.

Confirmatory Factor Analysis on the Immediate Post-Concussion
Assessment and Cognitive Testing (ImPACT) at Baseline.
Objective: The purpose of this study was to examine the dimensionality
of the hypothetical constructs that compose the Immediate Post-Concussion Assessment and Cognitive Testing (ImPACT), a popular, computerized assessment of neurocognitive function after concussion. The
factor structure of ImPACT is hypothesized to consist of four different
domains for clinical interpretation: Verbal Memory, Visual Memory,
Visual Motor Speed, and Reaction Time.
Participants and Methods: A confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was
conducted on retrospective baseline ImPACT data from 495 collegiate
student athletes at the University of Florida. The CFA was conducted
using SPSS AMOS on a four factor, oblique model.
Results: Fit indices suggested poor model fit for the proposed four factor solution in our sample. Significant overlap was found between the
Reaction Time and Visual Motor Speed factors and between the Visual
Memory and Verbal Memory factors. Individual subtests varied significantly in the amount of variance explained by each of the four factors
to which they were assigned. Parameter estimates, factor loadings, and
correlation matrices are presented.

82
Conclusions: Our findings indicate that the existing factor structure
of the ImPACT test may not be ideal according to CFA and may be
improved by a different interpretive framework such as the two-factor
solution proposed by Schatz and Maerlander (2013). Additionally, the
structure of specific subtests within factors may benefit from further
investigation and refinement.

A. SORRELL & A. BENITEZ. Construct Validity of the NIHToolbox Cognition Battery Fluid and Crystallized Composite
Scores in Cognitively Healthy Older Adults.
Objective: The NIH-Toolbox Cognition Battery (NIHTB-CB) is a new
series of computerized tests yielding composite scores of fluid and crystallized intelligence. Fluid abilities are thought to reflect changes in
neurobiological integrity due to aging, while crystallized intelligence
remains fairly static even in old age. We sought to demonstrate the convergent and discriminant validity of these composite scores using gold
standard neuropsychological tests, demographic estimates of premorbid
intelligence, and MRI volumes.
Participants and Methods: 51 cognitively healthy older adults (Age:
67.8 ± 5.4, 64.7% female, 94.1% White) underwent neuropsychological
testing and brain MRI. Fully adjusted FLU and CRY scaled scores from
the NIHTB-CB, raw scores of the gold standard neuropsychological tests,
and T1-MPRAGE images submitted to NeuroQuant® for volumetric
analysis (volumes in cm3 normalized to intracranial volume) were analyzed using Pearson’s correlations and Hotelling’s t tests.
Results: CRY scores, more than FLU scores, correlated with word
reading tests (i.e. AmNART, WRAT Reading; r’s=|0.74-0.81|, p<0.01)
and a demographic estimate of premorbid intelligence (i.e. years of
education, r=0.39, p<0.01). FLU scores, more than CRY scores, correlated with gold standard neuropsychological tests (i.e. digit symbol
coding, trailmaking tests; r’s=|0.26-0.46|, p<0.05-0.01) and inferior
and lateral ventricular volumes (r’s=|0.23-0.27|, p<0.05). Both CRY
and FLU scores moderately correlated (r’s=|0.26-0.43|, p<0.05-0.01)
with neuropsychological tests that may comparably tap both abilities
(i.e. letter and category fluency, WMS-R delayed story percent recall).
Conclusions: The NIHTB-CB Crystallized and Fluid Composite scores
demonstrate adequate construct validity for use in cognitively healthy
older adults.

M.C. ADLER, B. SMITH & E.M. CROUSE. General Unhappiness
and Dissatisfaction Impacts Elevations on the Behavior Rating
Inventory of Executive Function-Adult: An Emotional, Not
Cognitive, Connection.
Objective: Evidence from child and adult studies demonstrate that the
relationship between subjective report of executive functioning (EF)
and performance on object measures is tenuous (Rabin et al., 2006;
Toplak et al., 2013). This study sought to determine the extent to which
self-report of EF on the Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function-Adult Version (BRIEF-A) is influenced by performance on EF tests
and self-report of general unhappiness and dissatisfaction.
Participants and Methods: Thirty eight veterans completed a neuropsychological evaluation, passed performance validity tests, and
completed a Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory-2 (MMPI-2)
and BRIEF-A in a valid manner. An EF Index was calculated using
the average of normalized scores on EF measures for each participant.
Correlation coefficients were calculated among BRIEF-A clinical scales
and index scores, the MMPI-2 RCd scale, and the EF Index.

Results: BRIEF-A index scores correlated significantly with RCd (Behavior Regulation Index: r=.51, Metacognition Index: r=.52, Global Executive Composite: r=.60, p≤.001). All BRIEF-A scales also significantly
correlated with RCd (rs ranged from .40 to .68, ps from .01 to <.001),
with the exception of Emotion Regulation (r=.25, p=.13) and Organization of Materials (r=.25, p=.14). Correlations among BRIEF-A scales
with the EF Index were all non-significant (rs ranged from .02 to .24),
with the exception of Task Monitoring (r=.38, p=.02).
Conclusions: In general, BRIEF-A scales and index scores are much
more strongly associated with general unhappiness and dissatisfaction
than they are with actual performance on tests of executive abilities.
To our knowledge, the susceptibility of the BRIEF-A to unhappiness
and dissatisfaction has been under-examined. These results help answer
previously raised questions (Yehyawi et al., 2011) regarding the influence of rater biases (e.g., distress) on perception of EF impairments.
Implications regarding the nature of performance and metacognition
are discussed.

Choosing Appropriate Control Group Participants in Studies of
Veterans: Characteristics of Orthopedically Injured and Uninjured
OEF/OIF/OND Veterans.
Objective: Research addressing deployment-related traumatic brain
injury (TBI) is fairly complex due to a high prevalence of co-morbid
conditions, multiple exposures, and the lack of acute medical records.
Therefore, there is a need for a well-defined, matching control group.
This study compared deployment-related characteristics, everyday functioning, and cognitive performance in recently deployed veterans who
had not sustained any injuries with those who had orthopedic injuries
during deployment, but who were without TBI.
Participants and Methods: Participants included 37 individuals who
had been deployed and who were without injuries and a group of 24
individuals who reported at least one orthopedic injury during deployment. The Mayo-Portland Adaptability Inventory-4, Community Integration Questionnaire, Veterans RAND 36 Item Health Survey, Brief
Pain Inventory, Barratt Impulsiveness Scale -11, and PTSD Checklist
– Civilian were used to assess daily functioning. Cognitive performance
was measured using the Controlled Oral Word Association Test, Trail
Making Test, Color-Word Interference Test, and Verbal Selective Reminding Test.
Results: Participants with and without a history of extra-cranial injury did not differ significantly in age, gender distribution, education,
post-deployment interval, level of combat exposure, or current level of
intellectual functioning. Substance abuse issues were rarely reported
in both groups. Participants with history of orthopedic injury were not
significantly different in their current symptom reporting and did not
experience more limitations in daily activities. There were no significant
between-group differences in cognitive performance.
Conclusions: Orthopedic injuries sustained during deployment did not
have any lasting effect on participants’ health, cognition, and daily
functioning. These results indicate the two groups are comparable and
that their data could be combined to create a single control group.

Forty Fourth Annual INS Meeting Abstracts
impairment in individuals with neurological insult or disease. Previous
construct validation research using healthy adults supported the interpretation of the NIHTB-CB tests as measures of reading, vocabulary, episodic memory, working memory, and combined executive functioning/
processing speed. Because many clinicians want to use the NIHTB-CB
to measure cognition in individuals with neurocognitive deficits across
a broad range of medical, neurological, and developmental conditions,
the current study evaluated if the tests measure the same cognitive
constructs in individuals with acquired brain injury.
Participants and Methods: 392 adults, diagnosed with either a traumatic brain injury or a stroke completed the NIHTB-CB as well as
established neuropsychological measures (RAVLT, PPVT-R, WRAT-IV
Reading, WAIS-III LNS, CD, and SS, DKEFS CWIT IN, and BVMT-R)
as part of a multisite research project. Confirmatory factor analyses
(CFA) was conducted using SPSS AMOS Software. Alternative models
of cognition were tested and goodness of fit indices (AGFI, RMSEA, TLI,
CFI, and BIC) were compared to evaluate model fit.
Results: The results of the CFA suggest that a 5-factor model comprised
of language, episodic memory, working memory, processing speed, and
executive functioning had the best fit to the data. CFA analysis of the
NIHTB-CB core seven subtests alone yielded supported a three- factor
structure of Language, Memory, and Executive functioning. Cross-loadings and error covariances indicated that individual NIHTB-CB measures may draw on multiple cognitive abilities.
Conclusions: This research marks the first evaluation of the NIHTB-CB
tests in a clinical population of individuals who an acquired brain injury
and are likely to have cognitive impairment. Overall the results suggest a
strong model fit for the NIHTB-CB for a 5 factor solution that represents
the construct domains of the NIHTB-CB tests.

B. VERMILION, L.J. RAPPORT & C.G. WONG. Can You Hear Me
Now? Phonetic and Semantic Analysis of a List-Learning Task.
Objective: The objective of this study was to evaluate phonetic, phonotactic, and lexical properties of the Hopkins Verbal Learning Test –
Revised (HVLT-R) six alternate forms. Hearing loss is common among
older adults; however, most verbal memory tests are administered with
auditory stimuli. The phonetic properties of words used in verbal memory tests could disadvantage examinees with hearing loss and could
cause differential equivalence of alternate forms.
Participants and Methods: The data consisted of 144 words from the
six forms of the HVLT-R. Each form has 12 words for learning and
free-recall trials, and 12 foils for recognition trials. Word frequency
was determined using SUBTLEX (US) norms. Number of syllables
and phonemes, neighborhood word density, and phonotactic positional
probability were derived from the Irvine Phonotactic Online Dictionary
(IPHOD) database.
Results: Kruskal-Wallis and ANOVA tests with planned contrasts using
Mann-Whitney and t tests indicated significant differences across the six
HVLT-R forms. For learning trial words, forms differed significantly
with large effects on number of syllables and phonemes, word frequency,
and neighborhood density. Phonotactic positional probability showed
meaningful effect size, which was nonsignificant due to low power associated with the limited population of words per list. Recognition foil
words showed a medium effect size for differences on word frequency
and word density, but small effects on phonemes, syllables, and positional probability.
Conclusions: HVLT-R alternate forms are not equivalent for word
frequency, neighborhood density, phonemic and syllabic structure. Differences in phonetic, phonotactic, and lexical properties across the six
forms may pose problems of differential reliability and validity for persons with hearing impairment. Future research should directly examine
the associations of these word properties with performance protocols
from patients with and without hearing loss.

E. WELTON, T. RUBINSTEIN & B. FREILICH. A Brief Attention,
Memory, and Frontal Abilities Screening Test (AMFAST) for
Children and Adults.
Objective: The present study describes the development and effectiveness of a novel, empirically-based cognitive screening measure designed
to assess impairment in processing speed, attention, memory, and executive skills which are present in many neurologic and psychiatric
disorders in both children and adults. To date, no other screening measure (e.g., MOCA) specifically evaluates these domains exclusively. The
AMFAST requires minimal training to administer and can be effectively
used by treating clinicians in 10 minutes to determine if comprehensive
neuropsychological testing is needed.
Participants and Methods: 32 cognitively normal individuals were
recruited as the normative sample. They represent a highly diverse
Bronx community sample from ages 8-89. Roughly equal numbers of
males/females of various ethnic backgrounds and education levels were
included. A mixed clinical sample, used to classify how accurately the
AMFAST identified impairment, was comprised of patients evaluated
by the authors via comprehensive neuropsychological assessment with
evidence of cognitive impairment.
Results: A scoring system was created based on the distribution of the
responses in the normative sample. An overall cutoff score of ≤75/100
(96% of the normative sample scored >75) suggests comprehensive
testing is highly recommended. With this cutoff, the AMFAST accurately classified 95% of the overall sample, with 83% sensitivity and
97% specificity.
Conclusions: The AMFAST is a novel, empirically-based cognitive
screening measure that can be administered by treating clinicians to
identify the presence of attention, memory, processing speed, and executive deficits in children and adults, and to determine the need for
comprehensive neuropsychological testing. The AMFAST correctly classified 95% of the overall sample using a cutoff of ≤75.

Order of Test Administration Affects Verbal Fluency Performance.
Objective: The order that neuropsychological measures are administered has been shown to impact an individual’s performance and can led
to validity issues. Few studies have examined the impact of test order
effects on tests which assess a similar cognitive ability, such as verbal
fluency. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether or not
there are order effects between phonemic (FAS) and semantic fluency
(animals) when administered successively.
Participants and Methods: This pilot study utilized a random sample
method, which yielded 62 healthy participants. All participants were
prescreened for previous brain injuries, significant mood disturbances,
and other neurological disorders such as attention-deficit disorders as
well as learning disabilities. The sample was divided into two groups
based upon administration order. Group 1 was administered FAS immediately followed by animals, while Group II was given reverse administration. Independent samples t-tests were conducted to assess for
group differences.
Results: Groups were similar on gender and did not significantly differ
on demographic variables such as age and education. Results indicated
a significant test order effect for phonemic fluency on semantic fluency.
Specifically, when compared to Group II, Group I had significantly lower
T-scores on semantic fluency t(61) = 3.12, p = .002, r = .37. Results also
indicated an effect for semantic fluency on phonemic fluency. Group II
demonstrated significantly higher T-scores on FAS, when compared to
Group I t(61) = -2.339, p = .022, r = .31.

84
Conclusions: These results indicate possible test order effects in assessing phonemic and semantic fluency when administered successively,
resulting in either under and over inflation of verbal fluency scores,
depending upon the order of administration. These results have implications both in terms of clinical interpretation as well as for test
administration procedures. Similar research in clinical populations is
in progress.

K.L. ZANE, N.A. EMMERT & J.D. GFELLER. Detecting Insufficient
Effort in Persons with Post-Acute Traumatic Brain Injury using the
Conners’ Continuous Performance Test-II.
Objective: The Conners’ Continuous Performance Test-Second Edition (CPT-II), a measure of attentional processes, has recently been
examined as a measure of insufficient effort. The present study investigated CPT-II indicators of limited effort in persons with post-acute
traumatic brain injury (TBI) of varying severity. We hypothesized that
persons with mild TBI who failed effort testing on the Word Memory
Test (WMT) would have lower CPT-II scores compared to persons with
mild or moderate to severe TBI who passed. We also hypothesized that
CPT-II effort indicators would demonstrate some utility to detect insufficient effort in persons with TBI.
Participants and Methods: The present study utilized archival data
from a clinical sample (N = 132) of adults who sustained a TBI. All
participants completed the CPT-II and WMT as part of a larger neuropsychological evaluation. Participants were divided into 3 groups based
on brain injury severity and WMT performance (pass/fail): Mild TBI
(MTBI)-Pass (n = 68), MTBI-Fail (n = 19), and moderate to severe TBI
(MSTBI)-Pass (n = 45).
Results: A multivariate analysis of variance revealed performance differences on four CPT-II variables (Omissions, Hit Response Time Standard Error, Variability, and Perseverations). Univariate and post hoc
analyses indicated that the MTBI-Fail group exhibited impaired CPT-II
scores relative to the MTBI-Pass and MSTBI-Pass groups. Moreover,
the Receiving Operating Curve (ROC) area for the CPT-II Omissions
variable (.72) suggested fair properties as an indicator to classify persons
giving adequate versus insufficient effort (p < .004).
Conclusions: Results from the current study indicate that individual
CPT-II variables have some utility to identify low effort in persons with
post-acute TBI. In particular the CPT-II Omission variable has some
clinical utility to “rule in” or “rule out” insufficient effort. Additional
research of the CPT-II as a measure of effort among persons with TBI
is encouraged.

A. ALKOZEI & W.D. KILLGORE. Exposure to Blue Wavelength
Light Suppresses Anterior Cingulate Cortex Activation in Response
to Uncertainty During Anticipation of Negative or Positive Stimuli.
Objective: Blue wavelength light has been used as an effective treatment
for some types of mood disorders, including depression and seasonal
affective disorder. The neurobiological mechanism behind this effect,
however, remains unclear. One possible explanation for this effect may
be that blue light influences functioning of the emotion-regulation neurocircuitry when processing emotional stimuli. We hypothesized that
acute exposure to blue wavelength light would directly affect the functioning of the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, amygdala, insula, and
anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) during an emotional anticipation task.
Participants and Methods: Twenty-nine healthy 18-32 year olds
(15 females, mean age = 21.57) were randomized to receive an acute

thirty-minute exposure to either blue (active) (n=14) or amber (placebo)
light (n=15), immediately followed by functional magnetic resonance
imaging (fMRI). During scanning, participants completed a task that
involved presentation of cues that portended an upcoming positive or
negative emotional stimulus of certain or uncertain valence. Participants
also reported on their depressive symptoms using the Beck Depression
Inventory (BDI-II).
Results: In contrast to placebo light, participants in the blue light group
showed significantly (p < .003) reduced activation within the rostral and
dorsal ACC during uncertain anticipation (i.e., uncertainty regarding
whether a positive or negative stimulus would be shown) in comparison
to certain anticipation (i.e., assured exposure to a positive stimulus).
Notably, within the blue, but not the placebo group, greater depressive
symptoms correlated with deactivation within the rostral ACC (r=-.59,
p<.02).
Conclusions: Findings suggest that blue light exposure may lead to
suppression of emotional brain responses during anticipation of uncertain outcomes. As this effect was correlated with greater depressive
symptoms, these findings may point to one potential neurobiological
mechanism by which light exposure improves mood.

A. ALKOZEI & W.D. KILLGORE. Exposure to Blue Wavelength
Light is Associated with Increased Dorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex
Responses During a Working Memory Task.
Objective: Consistent long-term exposure to blue enriched white light
has been associated with increases in self-reported alertness, concentration, work performance and decreases in fatigue and sleepiness. The aim
of this study was to investigate whether a short single exposure to blue
light would lead to measurable changes in functional brain responses
during a working memory task.
Participants and Methods: Twenty-nine healthy 18-32 year olds (15
females, mean age = 21.79) were randomized to receive a 30-minute
exposure to either blue (active) (n=14) or amber (placebo) light (n=15),
immediately followed by a working memory task (N-Back task) during
functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI).
Results: In contrast to placebo, participants in the blue light group
showed significantly greater activation within the dorsolateral prefrontal
cortex (DLPFC) with increases in working memory load (two back>zero
back) (k = 69; x = -48, y = 14, z = 22; p = .01, FWR corrected at the
cluster level). There was a trend that participants in the blue group
had faster reaction times during conditions of high cognitive load in
comparison to participants in the placebo group (MBlue = 574.09ms
(203.81ms); MPlacebo = 692.89ms (222.71ms), p = .10).
Conclusions: The results suggest that a short single exposure to blue
light is sufficient to produce measurable changes within the DLPFC,
a brain area recruited during heavy cognitive load. This may explain
why previous studies have reported increases in subjective alertness
and performance after long-term blue light exposure. Our results point
in the direction that blue light exposure may be associated with better
performance, albeit the results did not reach statistical significance. It
is possible that while 30 minutes of blue light exposure is sufficient to
lead to increases in activation within certain brain areas, longer exposure is necessary to produce objective behavioral changes. Replication
with a larger sample size and varying durations of blue light exposure
is therefore necessary.

H. GAGNON & R.L. SKEEL. The Effect of Self-Criticism on Working
Memory Performance Following Success and Failure.
Objective: Maladaptive self-criticism (SC) refers to a form of self-concept, shaped by negative self-evaluation and self-judgment that is targeted at various aspects of the self. It has been associated with various
psychopathologies and health vulnerabilities, as well as diminished goal
progress. Failure has been reported to engender a sense of self-punitive worthlessness, provoking intense sensitivity and fear. Given the
heightened response to failure, the objective of the present study was to
examine the impact of failure and success on performance on working
memory measures.
Participants and Methods: 218 participants with varying levels of
trait SC (low, moderate, and high) were randomly assigned to either a
success or a failure condition. Participants completed a baseline working
memory task, followed by a success/failure manipulation on a separate
task, and then completed a second working memory task.
Results: Results demonstrated varying feedback-dependent test-retest
performance as it relates to levels of SC. While low self-critics did not
differ in test-retest scores, moderate and high self-critics were impacted
by success and failure. Failure resulted in a decrease of performance
in moderate self-critics, while high self-critics displayed an increase in
retest scores. Conversely, after success, moderate self-critics displayed
an increase, while high self-critics displayed a decrease in performance
at retest.
Conclusions: Findings shed light on how high self-critics may perceive
and respond to failure versus success, which has important implications
for factors that impact motivation and goal-directed behavior. Findings
are discussed with respect to the effects of stress on brain networks
responsible for emotion processing and reward feedback, in order to
clarify the neurological basis of SC and goal-directed behavior.

M. AZAR, E. HUEY, K. COLLINS, B. ROHL, E. LOUIS &
S. COSENTINO. Awareness of Cognitive Abilities in Individuals
with Essential Tremor.
Objective: There is growing recognition that individuals with Essential tremor (ET) can demonstrate cognitive impairment secondary to
cerebellar dysfunction and are also at increased risk for neurodegenerative disorders. As the perception of cognitive changes can vary widely
across neurologic conditions, the aim of this study was to determine
the extent to which individuals with ET accurately perceive specific
cognitive changes.
Participants and Methods: 55 non-demented individuals with ET
underwent cognitive testing. Using a modified Brief Anosognosia Rating Scale, participants and informants separately rated participants’
cognitive abilities in the domains of multitasking, memory, and word
finding. Partial correlations adjusted for age, education, and gender
were used to measure the strength of the association between ratings in
these 3 domains and performance on tests of these abilities including
verbal fluency switching, delayed verbal memory, and confrontation
naming, respectively. Fischer’s z-tests were used to detect differences
in the strength of the association between performance and self vs informant ratings in each domain.
Results: For multitasking, self-ratings were more strongly associated
with performance (r=.46, p<.01) than informant ratings (r=.10, p=.49),
p=.03. For memory, informant ratings were more strongly associated
with performance (r=.46, p<.01) than self-ratings (r=.01, p=.96),
p<.01. Similarly, informant ratings for word finding were more strongly
associated with performance (r=.37, p=.01) than self-ratings (r=.02,
p=.92), p=.03.
Conclusions: Participant ratings regarding multitasking were more
closely related to performance than informant ratings. The opposite
pattern was observed for memory and word finding. Dissociations
in self-report across cognitive domains have implications for seeking

85
patient versus informant report when ascertaining the presence of specific cognitive symptoms in individuals with ET.

K.A. CARBINE, K. SLINN, J. LECHEMINANT & M.J. LARSON. The
Effects of Exercise and Time of Day on Inhibitory Control towards
High- and Low- Calorie Food Cues.
Objective: There is an increasing interest in the role of executive and
inhibitory control functions in food intake and obesity. Decreased ability
to inhibit responses to food cues may be associated with eating behaviors
and body weight. We examined the influence of food calorie status (high
vs low), time of day (morning vs evening), and exercise (exercise vs rest)
on food-related response inhibition during high- and low-calorie Go/
No-Go tasks. We hypothesized faster reaction times (RTs) and greater
accuracy in the morning and exercise conditions when responding to
low-calorie foods, reflecting enhanced inhibitory control.
Participants and Methods: RT and accuracy data were collected while
61 healthy-weight participants completed two food Go/No-Go tasks between 7-10am or 7-10pm, once after resting and once after 45 minutes
of treadmill walking at 3.8mph. All participants completed tasks using
high-calorie foods as No-Go stimuli and low-calorie foods as No-Go
stimuli and recorded food intake on days of participation.
Results: In a 2-calorie (high, low) x 2-exercise (rest, exercise) x 2-time
(morning, night) ANOVA, RTs were faster towards low- relative to
high-calorie foods (p<.01). A calorie by exercise interaction showed
high-calorie food RTs were faster after exercise relative to rest, whereas
low-calorie food RTs remained constant across conditions (p=.05). No
main effects or interactions for accuracy were significant (ps>.12). Pearson correlations relating caloric intake to accuracy and RTs showed that
when inhibiting towards high-calorie foods after resting, accuracy is
negatively related to caloric intake (r=-.35, p=.04).
Conclusions: Exercising may be effective in managing the increased
attention individuals have towards high- relative to low-calorie foods.
Inhibitory control towards high-calorie foods may affect regulating food
intake after periods of inactivity. Time of day does not seem to affect
food-related inhibition. Other measures of cognitive control, like EEG,
should be used to examine food-related inhibition.

J.E. COHEN-GILBERT, M.M. SILVERI & L.D. NICKERSON. Impact
of Acute Alcohol and Nicotine use on Emotional Impulsivity:
Associations with Resting State Perfusion in Reward Circuitry.
Objective: A high percentage of individuals co-use alcohol and nicotine,
which together lead to more severe substance abuse disorders compared
to use of either substance alone. However, cognitive and neural mechanisms that underlie the interactive effects of these drugs to facilitate couse are still poorly understood. The current study examined the impact
of acute alcohol and nicotine challenges on emotional impulsivity and
on cerebral blood flow (CBF) in key reward-processing brain regions,
acquired at rest using PCASL fMRI.
Participants and Methods: Seven males who were light to moderate
smoker/alcohol drinkers completed both placebo nicotine patch + alcohol (PA) and 14mg nicotine patch + alcohol (NA) conditions in randomized order. Emotional impulsivity was measured via an emotional
Go-NoGo task that featured negative, positive, neutral or scrambled
distractor images.
Results: A repeated-measures ANOVA examining the impact of both
drugs on NoGo trial accuracy revealed an increase in impulsivity (reduced NoGo accuracy) for positive trials, in response to alcohol, across
both PA and NA conditions. No main effect of nicotine was observed.
Nicotine and alcohol were found to increase CBF in the nucleus accumbens. In the NA condition relative to nicotine alone, the change

86
in CBF in right nucleus accumbens was significantly correlated with
reaction time on Go trials.
Conclusions: While the small sample size of this pilot study precludes
firm conclusions regarding the role of emotional impulsivity in alcohol
and nicotine co-use, these findings suggest that the interplay of positive
emotion, reward-related circuitry and impulsivity may have important
implications for understanding how alcohol and emotion interact to
increase risky behavior in young adults who co-use alcohol and nicotine.

Early Life Trauma Impacts the Association between Gray Matter
Integrity and Memory in Combat-Exposed Veterans.
Objective: Early Life Trauma (ELT) has been shown to impact cognition well into adulthood. However, little is known about the relationship
between gray matter integrity of regions affected by ELT and cognitive
performance. In the current study, we used the California Verbal Learning Test (CVLT) to examine memory in Veterans with and without a
history of ELT.
Participants and Methods: 233 Veterans from the Translational Research Center for TBI and Stress Disorders (TRACTS) were recruited
in the current study. History of ELT was based on reports of sexual
abuse, physical abuse or family violence before 18 years old (ELT+ N
=79; ELT- N = 154). Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Symptoms (PTSD)
were measured using the Clinician-Administered PTSD scale. Cortical
thickness and subcortical volumes were measured using the tools provided by the FreeSurfer suite.
Results: Veterans with ELT performed worse on the standardized short
delay free recall, but not long delay recall, compared with Veterans
without ELT. When looking at cortical thickness, Veterans with ELT
showed a positive association between thickness of the right superior
temporal gyrus and total number of intrusions, while Veterans without
ELT showed a negative association. A similar positive association was
found in ELT between the number of intrusions and the volume of the
left amygdala as well as bilateral hippocampus.
Conclusions: Our findings suggest that ELT may influence direction of
the relationship between brain integrity and behavior that is typically
observed, both at a cortical and subcortical level, in areas sensitive to the
impact of stress. The decreased performance in short-delay recall further
indicates that Veterans with ELT may suffer more from interference
compared with Veterans without ELT.

G. GALINDO, M.A. FRAGA & R.I. MACHINSKAYA. Effect of
Emotional Valenced Stimuli on Working Memory Performance.
Objective: Working memory (WM) is the ability to keep information
cognitively in course for a brief period of time, but with enough duration
as to complete a task. Few is known about how the different emotional
valences of the perceived information provoke effect over WM, since it
is known that for WM task performance, motivated behavior receives
important emotional influence. The objective of the present study was
to determine the possible effects of different emotionally valenced visual
stimuli (i.e., pictures of scenes or facial expressions) on decision making
in a working memory task in young adults.
Participants and Methods: A total of 27 subjects university students,
randomly selected, participated in the study. Data was acquired from
23 right handed subjects (20.22 yr mean age, SD = 1.47), 52.2% male
(20.09 yr old mean age, SD = 1.7), 47.8% female (20.35 yr mean age,
SD = 1.3). Instruments and procedure, influence of emotional valence in

a WM task was measured using content from the International Affective
Picture System (IAPS), subjects were asked to remember the first image
of the pair, compare the second image with it. Accuracy of response (AR)
measured by the number of correct responses, and reaction times (RT)
were obtained for each subject.
Results: Results show that the RT is shortest for pictures with neutral
valence and longest for negative valence, MANOVA statistics showed a
significant main effect of emotional valence. It was found that the AR is
highest for pictures with neutral valence and lowest for negative valence.
Conclusions: The main finding of the present study was that emotionally charged IAPS images were processed worse than neutral pictures
during the WM task. We also observed an effect of emotional valence
on RT, which was longer for negative pictures than for positive pictures.

M. RAMÍFEZ-FLORES & M.T. GARCIA. Skills of Theory of Mind
in Mexican children of 3 to 5 years old.
Objective: Theory of Mind (ToM) is the ability of understanding the
mental states (desires, believes and thoughts) of other people and of
ourselves, and its goal is to understand and predict their behavior. The
aim of this study was to explore the cognitive and emotional abilities of
ToM in Mexican children of 3, 4 and 5 years old, and to analyze if these
abilities were influenced by age, sex or social variables such as type of
school, siblings and parents’ education.
Participants and Methods: The study was divided in two phases. In
the first phase we translated, adapted and applied the test Scales of
Theory of Mind given by Wellman & Liu (2004) in a population of 20
Mexican boys and girls of 3, 4 and 5 years old. In the second phase we
assessed, with the same test, 60 Mexican children of the same ages from
different schools (private and public).
Results: Results showed significant differences in the development of
the abilities of ToM across ages, specifically between 3 and 4 years old,
and between 3 and 5 years old (X2 = 20.18, p=.000). Also we observed
a positive correlation between ToM and age of the children (r=.589,
p= .000 < 0.05).
In regard of the social variables, a factorial static analysis was performed
to determine which kind of social aspects affect the children’s performance in this test and it was found that the children’s education, their
age and siblings explain the 46% of variance in the test.
Conclusions: In conclusion there’s a relation between the age and the
development of ToM, nevertheless there are social variables such as
siblings and children’s education that could be affecting the performance
in this test. Likewise it can be observed that the development of this
ability is related with other cognitive process such as memory. Also the
results of this investigation are similar with others that had been made
in different continents, suggesting that maybe the development of ToM
could be overall.

C.E. HARRISON & S. ROGERS. Identifying the Specific FrontalExecutive and Processing Speed Deficits in Parkinson’s Disease.
Objective: Studies show that cognitive decline is a sequelae of Parkinson’s disease (PD), but much of this research has focused on general
cognitive domains, to the exclusion of differentiating specific cognitive
abilities within these domains. In the present study, the authors examined the specific executive and processing speed abilities that are involved in PD, while controlling for overall level of cognitive impairment.
Participants and Methods: 214 older adults (93 women, M age =
73.61, M education = 14.84) participated in neuropsychological assessment as part of outpatient neurology evaluations. All patients were

Forty Fourth Annual INS Meeting Abstracts
taking carbidopa-levodopa. Measures completed included MMSE,
MoCA, Trails A & B, WAIS-IV Similarities, Coding, Arithmetic, and
Letter-Number Sequencing, and DKEFS Color Naming, Word Reading,
and Inhibition.
Results: Those with PD performed worse on Trails A, t(193) = 2.66,
p < .01, WAIS-IV Coding, t(161) = 2.09, p < .04, and Letter-Number
Sequencing, t(120) = 3.16, p < .01. ANCOVAs controlling for MMSE/
MoCA scores showed worse performance on Trails A, F(1, 190) = 9.51, p
< .01, WAIS-IV Coding, F(1, 158) = 3.98, p < .05, and Letter-Number
Sequencing, F(1, 115) = 4.31, p < .05 among those with PD. There were
no significant differences in WAIS-IV Arithmetic or Similarities, Trails
B, or DKEFS Color Naming, Word Reading, or Inhibition.
Conclusions: The field of neuropsychology tends to speak of processing speed deficits and a frontal-executive syndrome accompanying PD
pathology, but this seems to represent an overgeneralization of each
domain. Working memory and visual processing speed in particular appear to be affected by PD pathology, but the remaining frontal-executive
and processing speed abilities appear to remain preserved, even when
overall level of cognitive impairment is controlled. These findings aid
our understanding of the diagnosis and pathophysiology of PD, as well
as provide guidance for the customization of treatment and cognitive
training for those suffering from PD.

M. ISHIDA & T. ARAI. Perceptual Integration of Locally Timereversed Speech in Japanese.
Objective: This study investigates how temporally inverted phonetic
information of “locally time-reversed speech” can be integrated and
perceived. Listeners listened to Japanese words and non-words in which
every certain length of speech (e.g., 50ms) was reversed on the horizontal time axis. Previous studies suggested that the intelligibility of locally
time-reversed speech gradually deteriorates as the length of flipped
segments becomes longer, but showed different deterioration curves;
some studies reported 70% intelligibility while the others 0% intelligibility when every 100ms was flipped along the time axis. The current
study attempts to explore the relationship between the reversal time
window length and the intelligibility of locally time-reversed speech,
by adopting Japanese language which has CV (consonant+vowel) as a
basic linguistic unit, and by considering the ratio of stop and fricative
consonants in speech which presumably have different tolerance to the
local time distortion.
Participants and Methods: Participants were 40 Japanese native
speakers. Half of them was randomly assigned to the fricative-dominant stimuli group, and the other half to the stop-dominant stimuli
group. They listened to a pair of a locally time-reversed word (or nonword) spoken by a male speaker, and an unreversed word (or non-word)
spoken by a female speaker in a row, and judged if the first and the
second speakers spoke the same or different words. There were four
different stimuli pairs: word-word (same), nonword-nonword (same),
word-nonword (different), nonword-word (different).
Results: The results suggested that fricative- dominant words were significantly more tolerant to the local time distortion than stop-dominant
words; Fricative-dominant words maintained more than 80% intelligibility with 110 ms reversal window length, while stop-dominant words
showed less than 60% intelligibility.
Conclusions: The intelligibility of locally time-reversed words is likely
to be susceptible to the ratio of fricative and stop consonants in speech.

W.T. MCCUDDY, S. POTTS & A. PORCELLI. Cognitive and
Cardiovascular Flexibility Relates to Stress Induced Habitual
Decision-Making.
Objective: The goal of the current study is to examine the extent to
which individual differences in cognitive and cardiovascular flexibility
protect goal-directed decision-making after exposure to acute stress.

87
Further, the current study aims to assess the relationship between these
variables and functional neuroimaging data during a decision-making
paradigm designed to assess goal-directed versus habitual behavior.
Participants and Methods: After completing a neuropsychological
test battery, which included Trails A and B, WAIS-IV Digit Span, a
computerized STROOP task, and Conner’s Continuous Performance
Test (CPT), we examined whether acute stress promoted expression of
simple financial preferences “overtrained” to the point of habit in the
face of a changing environment (N = 28). After exposure to either an
acute stressor or control procedure participants performed the same decision making task during fMRI scanning, with an added reversal phase.
Cardiac flexibility is operationally defined here by the high frequency
domain (HF) of heart rate variability (HRV), which provides a measure
of parasympathetic activation during the stress procedure.
Results: During fMRI scanning, after stimuli values were altered stressed
participants made significantly more habitual decisions, although these
decisions were now financially detrimental. Within the stress group (n
= 14) a negative relationship between the HF measure during the acute
stress procedure and number of habitual responses after stress reached
significance (r = -64, p < .05). Additionally, preliminary analysis of
neuropsychological measures revealed a significant correlation between
raw Trails B scores and number of post-stress habitual decisions (r =
.68, p > .01).
Conclusions: These results suggest that greater levels of cognitive and
cardiovascular flexibility might buffer the negative effects of stress on
decision-making.

L.A. OLIVERA FIGUEROA, R.P. JUSTER, J.K. MORIN MAJOR,
M.F. MARIN & S.J. LUPIEN. A Time to be Stressed? Time
Perspectives and Cortisol Dynamics Among Healthy Adults.
Objective: This study investigated whether Time Perspective (TP)
profiles like Balanced Time Perspective (BTP) and Negative Time Perspective (NTP) in healthy men and women would be divergently associated with cortisol dynamics in relation to a well-validated psychosocial
stressor, known as the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST).
Participants and Methods: Sixty-one healthy adults (Men = 32,
Women = 29) from Montreal ranging in age from 18 to 35 (M = 22.9,
SD = 4.1 years) participated. TP was measured according to two profiles: maladaptive Deviation from Balanced TP (DBTP) and adaptive
Deviation from Negative TP (DNTP). Eight salivary cortisol samples
were analyzed using area under the curve with respect to ground (AUCg)
and to increase (AUCi). Statistic analyses involved partial correlations
controlling for depressive symptoms.
Results: Results for both sexes showed that while controlling for depressive symptoms, higher DBTP scores were associated with lower
cortisol AUCg scores (r = -.272, p = .035) but not with cortisol AUCi
scores (r = -.124, p = .344). In contrast to DBTP, higher DNTP scores
were associated with higher cortisol AUCg scores (r = .258, p = .046)
but not with cortisol AUCi scores (r = .210, p = .108), while controlling
for depressive symptoms.
Conclusions: While results are modest, correlational, and require replication among diverse populations, our results nevertheless show for the
first time that cortisol systemic output (AUCg) is negatively associated
with maladaptive DBTP scores and positively associated with adaptive
DNTP scores. This association is exclusive to overall HPA-axis systemic
output and not to stress reactive increases or decreases (AUCi). These
findings may point to pervasive psychobiological modulation that must
be explored further cross-culturally, as well as in clinical research. In
summary, the observed cortisol dynamics are interpreted as having been
influenced by each participant’s respective TP profile.

D.J. PALOMBO, M.M. KEANE & M. VERFAELLIE. The Effect of
Semantic Future Thinking on Temporal Discounting: A Critical
Role for the Medial Temporal Lobes.
Objective: The capacity to envision the future plays an important role
in many aspects of cognition, including our ability to make optimal,
adaptive choices. Past work has shown that medial temporal lobe
(MTL) structures are implicated in decisions that draw on episodic
future thinking. By contrast, little is known about the role of the MTL
in decisions that draw on semantic future thinking. Accordingly, the
present study investigated whether the MTL contributes to one form
of decision making, namely intertemporal choice, when such decisions
depend on semantic consideration of the future.
Participants and Methods: Patients with MTL damage and healthy
controls performed an intertemporal choice task that drew on semantic
future thinking, such that, prior to decision, participants were required
to generate specific items that they would purchase with the future
reward.
Results: We found that, relative to a baseline condition involving standard intertemporal choice, healthy individuals were more inclined to
select a larger, later reward over a smaller, present reward after engaging
in semantic future thinking. By contrast, amnesic patients with MTL
damage were paradoxically less inclined to wait for a future reward
following semantic future thinking.
Conclusions: These findings suggest that the MTL is necessary for
making optimal decisions that draw on semantic future thinking, and
thereby broaden the role of the MTL in aspects of decision making.

K. REITER & K.A. NIELSON. Cognitive reserve offsets memory
decline and the influence of APOE ε4.
Objective: Cognitive reserve (CR) is a theoretical construct that explores
lifestyle factors that influence the trajectory of cognitive changes with
age and the maintenance of independent daily functioning. Most studies
assess CR as “achievement”, via a composite score of education, occupation, and verbal IQ, while some also include lifestyle choices such as
activities. The current study seeks to determine how CR, measured with
both achievement and late life activities, influences cognitive functioning
in healthy, cognitively intact older adults who vary by their genetic risk
for Alzheimer’s disease by the apolipoprotein-E ε4 allele.
Participants and Methods: Thirty-seven adults (age 51 to 84) completed neuropsychological assessment and genetic testing. A CR composite score was computed via principal components analysis (PCA)
of education, occupation, estimated IQ, and current lifestyle activities.
PCA was also conducted on neuropsychological measures to examine
common constructs. Two (High/Low CR) x 2 (ε4 + /-) ANCOVA was
conducted for each cognitive factor, regressing for age.
Results: PCA revealed 5 cognitive components: word list memory, fluency, processing speed, narrative memory, and digit span. High CR
led to better narrative memory (p = .05). CR also interacted with ε4
to produce better fluency (p<.05) and digit span (p<.05) in ε4 carriers
vs. non-carriers.
Conclusions: Cognition was differentially influenced by CR and ε4
inheritance. CR significantly benefitted memory for contextualized
material such as stories, articles, books, etc., which has relevance for
everyday functioning. Moreover, CR particularly benefitted those most
at risk for AD in the domains of verbal fluency and working memory,
both of which rely heavily on attentional capacity. Thus CR may help to
offset the trajectory of cognitive decline with advancing age in memory
and attention, and this offset may be particularly notable in those at
genetic risk for AD.

D. SMITH, C.L. ARMSTRONG, M.T. LONG, C. MURPHY,
S. KNIGHT & M.J. FISHER. Development of Cognitive Tests of
Cerebellar Function.
Objective: The cerebellum has a long and steep developmental trajectory, potent neural stem cells, and rapid learning capacity, and it is
relevant to the cognitive outcomes of many neurological disorders. Its
role in human non-motor cognition is recognized, but more empirical
support and understanding is needed. As the single most common site
of pediatric brain tumors, more precise cognitive markers of cerebellar
function are needed. We present early findings on tests of implicit cognitive function that are available by open-source.
Participants and Methods: Children (N=12, age 10.6y) with left,
right, or mid/bilateral cerebellar tumors, and healthy controls (N=11,
age=9.5y) yielded valid results on tests with empirical evidence from
normal, clinical, and functional imaging studies. Tests of implicit cognition were: (1)Serial Position, (2)Timing Functions, (3)Audio-Visual
Attention Shift, (4)Balls-in-a-Bottle. A test of explicit cognition was (5)
Phonological Working Memory.
Results: The hypothesized cerebellar-specific cognitive functions were
partially supported. (1)Patients’ learning effect was reduced on Serial
Position (p<0.005). (2)Patients were less accurate than controls in their
perception of longer tonal time intervals on the Timing Function test
(p<0.05). (3)Patients were less accurate in responding to the target
at shorter and longer intervals between cue and target when shifting
attention from auditory to visual attention (p<0.02 to p<0.0002). With
increasingly longer time elapsed, patients were less accurate and slower
than controls (p<0.0001). (4)There were no differences in estimating vs.
counting Balls-in-a-Bottle. (5)Patients’ accuracy in recalling words of
increasing phonological length was not significantly inferior to controls,
though means were lower at all lengths.
Conclusions: These preliminary results from our study of cognitive
processes that activated the cerebellum in prior reports, suggest that
cerebellar-specific cognitive tests have potential for clinical application
with further validation.

R. SMITH, A. ALKOZEI, J. BAO & W.D. KILLGORE. Successful
Goal-Directed Memory Suppression is Associated with Increased
Inter-Hemispheric Coordination Between Right and Left FrontoParietal Control Networks.
Objective: The neural basis of voluntarily suppressing conscious access
to one’s own memories has recently received considerable attention, with
several studies finding evidence that this process engages frontal and
parietal cognitive control regions. However, researchers to date have
not yet examined the way right and left hemisphere cognitive control
networks coordinate with one another during memory suppression.
Participants and Methods: Forty-eight participants (25 female; 1845 years of age) completed a Think/No Think task for memories of
emotionally unpleasant visual scenes while undergoing functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). We used psychophysiologic interaction
(PPI) analyses to examine functional connectivity between right and left
hemisphere frontal-parietal control regions during memory suppression.
Results: Right frontal-parietal regions were activated to a greater degree
by the “No Think” (NT) than “Think” (T) condition, whereas left frontal-parietal regions were activated by the reverse contrast. Participants
who were better at memory suppression, as assessed by greater numbers
of forgotten memories in the NT than T conditions, also had greater
functional connectivity between multiple right and left hemisphere control regions. This was true of connectivity between right (Peak Voxel
= 64, -34, 38) and left inferior parietal cortex (Peak Voxel = -24, -68,
46; T = 4.47) and between right (Peak Voxel = 6, -58, 54) and left
precuneus (Peak Voxel = -18, -66, 58; T = 5.00). We also observed
this pattern of connectivity between right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex
(DLPFC; Peak Voxel = 30, 34, 28) and primary visual cortex bilaterally
(Peak Voxel = 14, -78, -4; T = 4.76).

Forty Fourth Annual INS Meeting Abstracts
Conclusions: This suggests that individual differences in memory suppression ability may be partially explained by underlying differences in
task-specific inter-hemispheric coordination. It also suggests that right
DLPFC may be more successful at suppressing visual imagery in those
who are better at suppression.

J. SNEIDER, M.M. SILVERI & L.D. NICKERSON. Acute Alcohol
and Nicotine Effects on Hippocampal-based Memory Performance
and Resting State Quantitative Perfusion.
Objective: A high percentage of individuals co-use alcohol and nicotine, which together lead to more severe substance abuse disorders
compared to use of either substance alone. Despite established findings
of alcohol-related memory alterations in animal and human studies,
little is known regarding the underlying neurobiological mechanisms of
co-administration. This study examined memory performance on a virtual water maze task (vWMT) and cerebral blood flow (CBF) acquired
at rest using PCASL fMRI following nicotine and alcohol challenges.
Participants and Methods: Six males who were light/moderate
smoker/alcohol drinkers were randomized into placebo nicotine patch +
alcohol (PA) and 14mg nicotine patch + alcohol (NA) conditions. Offline
vWMT performance and CBF data were acquired prior to (baseline) and
following an oral acute alcohol challenge during scanning.
Results: Breath alcohol levels (BrAL) achieved prior to vWMT testing
were 0.077±0.026 (PA) and 0.075±0.016 (NA). Relative to the baseline, in the PA condition, significantly worse memory retention (-11%)
was observed, which correlated with higher BrALs. Significantly lower
resting state hippocampal CBF also was observed in the PA condition
(-15%) relative to the baseline. No significant memory or CBF decrements were observed in the NA condition.
Conclusions: Impaired memory retention associated with acute alcohol
exposure is consistent with previous animal studies. Further, alcohol-related memory impairment was not observed when alcohol and nicotine
were co-administered, suggesting that nicotine may mask some of alcohol’s impairing effects, as well as minimize effects on resting state CBF.
Such masking may enhance co-use of these substances, which during
acute exposure may be advantageous, but under chronic co-use conditions may have more significant consequences, such as greater severity
of substance abuse disorders and higher rates of relapse.

M. THAI, H. OKABE, J. DEGUTIS, S. LAGANIERE, M.A. HALKO
& M. ESTERMAN. Intermittent Theta Burst Stimulation of the
Dorsal Attention Network Cerebellar Node Improves Selective and
Sustained Attention.
Objective: Attention is one of the most commonly impaired domains
in neuropsychological populations. The core cortical network supporting selective and sustained attention is the dorsal attention network
(DAN). Although transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) of select
cortical nodes of the DAN can impact attention, little is known about
how whole-network modulation of the DAN impacts attention. Previous
work has demonstrated TMS of the cerebellum can be used to upregulate whole-network DAN functional connectivity. Using this cerebellar
network TMS approach, we hypothesized that increasing functional
connectivity within the DAN would improve selective and sustained
attention.
Participants and Methods: We administered intermittent theta burst
TMS (iTBS, a 2 s train of TBS [3 pulses at 50Hz, repeated at 200ms
intervals] is repeated every 10 s for a total of 190 s [600 pulses]) to the
midline cerebellar node of the DAN and, as a control, the right cerebellar

89
node of the default mode network (DMN) to 10 young, healthy adults at
80% of motor threshold. These targets were localized using individual
resting-state MRI scans. Participants completed the attentional blink, a
measure of selective attention, and the gradual onset continuous performance task (gradCPT), go/no-go sustained attention task, immediately
before and after stimulation, in two sessions (DAN and DMN) separated
by 1-2 weeks.
Results: Stimulation to the DAN improved selective attention, increasing accuracy on the attentional blink on average by 10% (p<.01), and
trended toward improving sustained attention, decreasing commission
errors for the gradCPT (p<.08). In contrast, stimulation to the DMN
did not affect performance on either task.
Conclusions: These results suggest that temporarily increasing functional connectivity in the DAN via cerebellar stimulation can enhance
selective and sustained attention. This has important implications for
the future use of iTBS to ameliorate attention deficits in neuropsychological populations.

A.A. WANK, M.M. KEANE & M. VERFAELLIE. Future Thinking
About Self Versus Other in Patients With Medial Temporal Lobe
Amnesia.
Objective: Research over the last decade has provided compelling evidence that a network of midline regions play a critical role in imagining
events in the future (episodic future thinking). However, the specific
contribution of each region to aspects of episodic future thinking remains less clear. One such region, the medial temporal lobe (MTL),
is critical for generating and/or recombining details in the service of
future simulations. Another midline region, ventromedial prefrontal
cortex (vmPFC), is thought to mediate representations of pre-existing
knowledge, including knowledge related to the self. Previous work has
demonstrated that in patients with amnesia, memory is enhanced when
it can be supported by pre-existing knowledge (Kan et al., 2008). Here
we examined whether pre-existing knowledge can also benefit future
thinking in patients with MTL lesions by comparing generation of future
events under conditions that differ in the extent to which they draw on
self-knowledge.
Participants and Methods: Nine patients with lesions to the MTL and
18 aged- and education-matched healthy control participants imagined
future events either from the perspective of the self (e.g., imagining
yourself going to a national park) or that of others (e.g., imagining your
doctor going apple picking). Participants’ descriptions of future events
were scored for number of episodic details.
Results: MTL patients showed an intact benefit associated with description of future events from a self-perspective, despite showing an overall
reduction in the generation of episodic details. This effect remained
when co-varying for familiarity in the ‘other’ condition.
Conclusions: These results suggest that integration of self-related
knowledge in future simulations does not depend on the MTL. These
findings extend previous research by demonstrating that patients with
MTL lesions can benefit from pre-existing knowledge to support not
only memory but also future thinking.

Neurophysiological Behavioral Inhibition (BIS) and Behavioral
Activation (BAS) Systems Are Related to Sleep Quality.
Objective: An estimated 50-70 million U.S. adults live with a sleepwake disorder, resulting in impaired daily functioning, increased
healthcare costs, and morbidity. The Reinforcement Sensitivity Theory
(RST) has previously been utilized to examine the individual differences

90
associated with sleep-related disorders. RST is comprised of distinct
neurophysiological systems that relate to approach and withdrawal
behaviors, including the Behavioral Activation System (BAS), and the
Behavioral Inhibition System (BIS). BAS is associated with left frontal
alpha activity (measured through EEG) and approach behavior, while
BIS is associated with right frontal activity and withdrawal behavior.
Previous research has suggested that elevated BIS levels are associated
with emotional dysregulation and poor sleep quality.
Participants and Methods: Taking the next step in this study, the relationships between BIS, BAS, frontal EEG asymmetry, and self-reported
sleep quality using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) were
examined in 75 university students. It was hypothesized that BIS would
be positively associated with the PSQI, while the opposite relationship
would be observed for BAS. It was also predicted that greater right than
left baseline resting frontal asymmetry scores would be significantly
related to poorer sleep quality.
Results: While associations were observed, they were opposite as hypothesized. BIS was weakly associated with the PSQI, r (75) = -.246, p
<.05), while no association was observed for BAS. Further, greater left
activity was associated with the PSQI for FP1, r (52) = .408, p <.01),
F7, r (53) = .477, p <.01), FT7, r (52) = .362, p <.01), and FC3, r
(50) = .328, p <.05) when compared to homologous right hemisphere
scalp sites.
Conclusions: These results, however, do indicate that sleep quality is
associated with self-reported behavioral inhibition and frontal EEG
asymmetry. Implications for these findings are discussed.

H. WEISS & K. LOW. Exploring the Relationships of Dissociative
Experiences, Sleep and Cognition in Undergraduates.
Objective: Because previous studies have found both positive and
negative relationships between dissociation and cognition in healthy
individuals, this study aimed to clarify the relationship between dissociation as assessed by the DES and various aspects of attention, including
working memory, selective, divided and sustained attention. Based on
the mixed literature and recent findings connecting dissociative experiences to abnormal sleep as measured by the Iowa Sleep Experiences
Scale, we hypothesized that sleep experiences might have a non-linear
association with dissociation and with certain neurocognitive dimensions
while controlling for mood.
Participants and Methods: 76 undergraduates completed a battery
of questionnaires measuring dissociative experiences, sleep, and mood
as well as neurocognitive tasks measuring working memory, selective,
divided and sustained attention.
Results: Correlational analyses revealed negative relationships between
the more pathological subscales, amnesia and derealization, of the Dissociative Experiences Scale and divided and selective attention. Dissociation and abnormal sleep experiences were positively related, but this
relationship was non-significant when controlling for mood.
Conclusions: The more pathological dissociative experiences had
unique relationships with cognition, which could indicate that they
represent phenomena distinct from the more common absorption dimension of dissociation. The negative relationship between dissociation
and selective and divided attention suggests that dissociative experiences
may be due to a decreased ability to process multiple stimuli simultaneously. Last, because controlling for mood eliminated the relationship
between dissociation and sleep, it is crucial that the growing body of
research built upon sleep-related hypotheses consider the role of mood
in these relationships.

Cerebrovascular Injury & Disease - Adult)

Neurobehavioral Symptom Inventory (NSI) Cognitive Items Do
Not Predict Cognitive Dysfunction.
Objective: The Neurobehavioral Symptom Inventory (NSI), a self-report measure of postconcussive symptoms, is part of the VA’s Comprehensive Traumatic Brain Injury Evaluation (CTBIE). Recent work
by French et al. (2014) concluded that NSI items intended to assess
cognitive dysfunction (inattention, forgetfulness, slowed thinking/disorganization) do not reliably predict impairment on objective neuropsychological measures. Rather, NSI cognitive item endorsement was better
accounted for by psychiatric distress as measured by the Personality
Assessment Inventory. The current study aimed to: (1) determine if
similar findings would be observed on additional neuropsychological
measures and the MMPI-2-RF and (2) delineate between veterans performing below, at, and above expectation on objective testing.
Participants and Methods: The sample included veterans who completed a valid MMPI-2-RF and a neuropsychological evaluation within
one year of NSI/CTBIE administration. Cognitive functioning was examined using mean t-scores of relevant neuropsychological measures.
Results: Correlations between NSI cognitive items and relevant neuropsychological measures were generally small (inattention: 0.07-0.17;
forgetfulness: 0.03-0.18) with the exception of slowed thinking/disorganization which evidenced larger correlations with Stroop subtests
(0.25-0.43) and Trails B (0.28). NSI cognitive items were generally
more highly correlated with MMPI-2-RF scales measuring internalizing dysfunction, somatic/cognitive concerns, and perceived helplessness (attention: 0.28-0.42; forgetfulness: 0.21-0.34; slowed thinking/
disorganization: 0.18-0.42). With regard to NSI cognitive items’ predictive utility, only 4-12% of veterans reporting significant cognitive
dysfunction exhibited low scores on objective testing while the majority
exhibited intact (70-85%) or above average (10-26%) performances.
Conclusions: The current results are consistent with previous findings and suggest NSI cognitive items are poor predictors of cognitive
dysfunction.

J.L. PRILUCK, X. BONILLA, C. EVANS & R. MOSS. Prolonged
Neuropsychological Deficit Following mTBI.
Objective: Investigators have enthusiastically argued about the reasonability of attributing prolonged mTBI symptoms to a recently incurred
mTBI. This study aimed to highlight quantifiable, clinical characteristics
of mTBI that did not remit after the typical three-months post-injury
recovery window.
Participants and Methods: This study presented Ms. S, a 40 year-old
Hispanic female, and Mr. V, a 26 year-old middle-eastern man, with
prolonged post-concussive complaints which continued at both fourmonths and 16-months post-injury. Data were obtained through clinical interviews, behavioral observations, neuropsychological measures,
neuroimaging, and electroencephalogram. Symptom validity testing was
done, including free standing and embedded measures.
Results: Data indicated severe memory and attention deficits consistent
with the minority of patients whose post-concussive symptoms persist
beyond three-months. Notably, patients’ histories included previous
head injury, and Ms. S had received documented accommodations
throughout her schooling due to the severe, childhood TBI.
Conclusions: These case studies offer both a verifiable, quantitative
glimpse at some of the minority of patients presenting with prolonged
mTBI symptoms, as well as suggest a reasonable explanation for their
prolonged deficits. It is therefore concluded that these case studies
suggest a subset of mTBI patients whose symptoms persist due to the
accumulated effects of previous TBI. These case studies will hopefully
provide impetus for larger-scale neuropsychological studies of patients

with prolonged mTBI symptoms. This research may provide additional,
quantifiable data that may be systematically reviewed. In turn, this will
aid methodically categorizing patients with prolonged mTBI complaints
by group, prognosis, and treatment recommendations.

Characteristics as Predictors of Community Integration Following
Combat Deployment.
Objective: Problems with social functioning, family relationships, and
initiation are highly prevalent among individuals who were deployed
to Iraq and Afghanistan. This study investigates the influence of demographic and deployment-related characteristics on community integration and participation in recently deployed veterans.
Participants and Methods: Participants included 141 recently deployed veterans (Age (years): mean= 33.9, SD= 6.8; Education (years):
mean= 14.3, SD= 1.8, Time since deployment (years); mean= 5.1, SD=
2.4) with a history of at least one traumatic brain injury during deployment. The Participation Index of Mayo-Portland Adaptability Inventory-4 (M2PI) and the Community Integration Questionnaire (CIQ)
were used to assess current level of community functioning and participation. The Combat Exposure Scale (CES) was used to assess war
zone stressors. Basic demographics and deployment- related information
were also collected.
Results: A multivariable ordinary linear regression revealed a significant effect of the CES total score (p= 0.04) and age (p= 0.002) on CIQ
total score and CES total score (p= 0.03) and time since deployment
(p= 0.002) on M2PI. More severe combat exposure negatively affected
integration and independence and resulted in greater functional impairment. Younger individuals and those with longer post-deployment
interval reported better community integration and functioning.
Conclusions: Deployment-related characteristics and demographic
features are important predictors of social and family functioning, initiation, and other aspects of community integration following combat
deployment.

present results on whole brain intrinsic functional connectivity in ASD in
later childhood; results suggest that hyperconnectivity within the several
large-scale networks, and especially the salience network, can correctly
classify autism cases. This network participates in attention allocation
to salient stimuli and may contribute to diminished interest in social
interaction. Dr. Eigsti will present data on activation of different brain
areas during language processing in adolescents with high-functioning
autism and those who have moved off the autism spectrum, to explore
the mechanisms of this ‘optimal outcome’. Dr. Fein will present a brief
discussion, considering the developmental implications of the 4 papers
from infancy through adolescence, and consider ways to characterize
the phenotype that may be crucial for integrating findings from disparate samples.

R. SCHULTZ. MRI Findings from the Collaborative Infant Brain
Imaging Study (IBIS).
The Infant Brain Imaging Study (IBIS) is a multisite prospective longitudinal study of babies and toddlers at risk for autism spectrum disorder
(ASD) by virtue of having an older sibling with ASD. This talk will
focus on results from the first data collection period (n ~400 high risk
ASD and ~150 low risk), when data were collected at age 6, 12 and
24 months, with diagnostic grouping tied to the 24 month outcomes.
At each time point parents completed questionnaires and interviews,
and infants underwent cognitive, diagnostic and MRI assessments, including structural MRI for neuroanatomical comparisons and diffusion
MRI for interferences about white matter connectivity and gray matter
microstructure. Results suggest that the recurrence risk for autism is
~20%. Significant cognitive and clinical symptoms of ASD emerge by 12
months of age. Gross motor differences emerged at 6 months. Key white
matter fiber bundles showed less steep growth trajectories between 6
and 24 months. “Sticky” visual attention was observed at 7 months, and
gaze shift latencies correlated with white matter fractional anisotropy
of select tracts. The corpus callosum (CC) was enlarged starting at 6
months (especially anterior portions), and CC size correlated positively
with repetitive behaviors at age 24 months. Radial diffusivity inversely
predicted CC thickness, suggesting myelination and axon composition
differences. At 24 months, those with ASD showed significantly decreased local and global network connectivity “efficiency”. Overall brain
size began to deviate in those with ASD at 6 months, with significantly
larger brain size and cortical surface area by 24 months. Gray matter
microstructure showed differences (suggestive of delayed dendritic development) at 12 and 24 months in sensory motor cortices, and cortices
that have functional roles in in older children and adults in perspective
taking and affective processes.

A. DIMARTINO. An Emerging Paradigm for Examination of
Autism in Early Brain Development.
Functional magnetic resonance (fMRI) imaging is a powerful means
to non-invasively map neuronal circuits underlying cognitive and
emotional processes. Yet, despite its promise to accelerate our understanding, diagnosis and treatment of mental illnesses such as autism,
progress has been slow. To accelerate the fMRI translational potential
in autism, we shifted focus into younger individuals, whole brain measures, and their relation with early index of outcomes. Specifically, we
used resting-state fMRI (R-fMRI) in natural sleep in 32 preschoolers
with autism (M age=57±10 months, 28 males). We profiled the intrinsic brain functional organization using data driven R-fMRI measures
amenable to full-brain examination without a priori hypotheses. These
included regional homogeneity (ReHo) and Voxel Mirrored Homotopic
Connectivity (VMHC) - which index local and interhemispheric connectivity, respectively - amplitude of low frequency fluctuations (fALFF),
and degree centrality (DC) - a graph theory network measure used to

92
characterize information flow throughout the entire connectome. As a
first step, we examined the relationship between each of these measures
and verbal proficiency measured by the expressive language scale of the
Vineland Adaptive Behavioral Scale-second edition (VABS-II). Each
R-fMRI measure captured specific aspects of the brain- language relationship in preschoolers with ASD. For example, homotopic connectivity
of associative occipital cortex was positively related to the verbal proficiency skills, while local connectivity of medial and lateral prefrontal
cortex was negatively correlated to VABS-II scores. Finally, analyses
also revealed a negative relationship between verbal proficiency and
interhemispheric homotopic connectivity for sensorimotor cortex. While
highlighting the role of thalamic-visual and sensorimotor networks for
verbal proficiency in ASD, our approach shows the potential for natural
sleep fMRI to identify neuronal signatures of autism that can eventually
serve as predictive markers of later outcome.

V. MENON. Functional and Structural Brain Organization in
Autism: Linking Physiology and Behavior.
An understanding of how the brain produces cognition ultimately depends on knowledge of its large-scale organization and wiring. The
human brain undergoes protracted structural and functional changes
during which it constructs dedicated large-scale brain networks comprised of discrete, interconnected, brain regions. Aberrations in brain
connectivity have been widely reported in autism, but their relation to
its three core symptoms – social communication, language and repetitive-restricted behaviors are unknown. In this talk I will describe recent
progress in our understanding of large-scale brain networks in autism
and demonstrate that its three core deficits can be linked to distinct
features of atypical brain connectivity in affected individuals. I will also
describe progress in development of connectivity based biomarkers of
the disorder and predictors of symptom severity. Although under-connectivity has been posited to be a hallmark of atypical brain organization
in autism, emerging findings in children with autism are painting a
decidedly more complex picture, one that has thrown into sharp relief
the challenges facing our understanding of brain connectivity over the
lifespan in autism. At the same time, they open new possibilities for a
deeper understanding of the neurobiological origins of the disorder. In
this vein, I will describe findings from a computational “virtual brain”
model which demonstrates that regional imbalance in excitation and
inhibition (E/I imbalance) in a few key hubs can lead to altered global
brain connectivity similar to those observed in individuals with autism.
Our model provides novel mechanistic insights into the neurophysiology
of the disorder. Implications of our findings for early detection and
treatment of autism will be discussed.

I. EIGSTI, B. CASTELLUCCIO, M. STEVENS & D. FEIN. Functional
Brain Activation During Language Comprehension in Youth with
Verbal Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), Typical Development,
and Optimal Outcomes from ASD.
Research has followed a group of youth with a history of autism spectrum disorder (ASD), who no longer have symptoms of the disorder and
who have typical language, social, cognitive and adaptive skills (dubbed
an “optimal outcome,” OO). Studies of head circumference in OO suggest enlarged brain volumes between ages one-two years, suggesting
early brain differences in OO, consistent with an ASD diagnosis at that
time. In this talk, we describe functional and structural brain differences
in youth with OO, highlighting mechanisms of plasticity that may underlie their developmental behavioral trajectories. We present results from
an fMRI study of youth with OO (n=16), ASD (n=23) and TD (n=20),
as they performed a sentence comprehension task. Results across groups
showed activations for sensory-motor regions; in anterior and posterior
language areas; and in visual areas. There was also deactivation in the

medial default network. Group differences suggested no evidence of full
“normalization” in the OO group (exemplified by OO, TD π ASD); there
were several regions where both OO and ASD groups had significantly
greater activations than the TD group, but did not differ from each
other. The predominant pattern suggested neural compensation, such
that the OO group showed heightened activation relative to both ASD
and TD groups. We also report diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) results,
which describe fractional anisotropy (FA), radial diffusivity (RD), and
axial diffusivity (AD) of white matter tracts, which were broadly consistent with the fMRI data in showing that the OO group differed from ASD
and TD groups in most tracts where there were group differences. We
suggest that these neural patterns are markers of functional plasticity,
potentially suggesting an extended period of neural reorganization. A
critical question is that of causality: does behavioral change reflect the
results of neural plasticity, or was the plasticity causally implicated in
behavioral progress? We discuss with reference to the infant stroke,
dyslexia, and cognitive aging literatures.

Role in Preventing, Understanding, and Treating Alcohol and
Marijuana Use in Adolescents and Young Adults.
Symposium Description: This symposium focuses on the role of neuropsychological functioning in emergent substance use disorders (SUDs),
particularly in regards to the two most commonly used substances:
alcohol and marijuana. The four presentations will progress along a
developmental continuum from early adolescence (Presentations 1 & 2)
to young adulthood (3 & 4) and will address the role of neuropsychology in preventing, understanding, and treating this important public
health issue:
(1) Dr. Squeglia will describe how neuropsychological test data, in combination with an innovative machine learning technique, can be used to
predict which youth will initiate heavy drinking during adolescence. The
ability to identify an at-risk child before heavy alcohol use is initiated
could have significant public health implications.
(2) Dr. Jacobus will discuss how neuropsychological functioning and
brain development are affected after adolescents initiate heavy alcohol
and marijuana use. Given the increasing prevalence of marijuana use
and changing legal policies, understanding the long-term neuropsychological and behavioral effects of marijuana use is an increasingly
important topic.
(3) Dr. Bidwell will examine the role of risky decision making in SUDs,
comparing risk-taking in emerging adults to older adults. These findings
suggest risk-taking is more salient in emerging adults, suggesting more
targeted assessment and treatment are essential during early adulthood.
(4) Dr. Schacht will conclude by examining the interplay between neuropsychological functioning, genetics, and alcohol treatment. His findings
suggest that genetic variation moderates medication effects on response
inhibition, suggesting that individualized alcohol treatment that selectively targets neuropsychological functioning could hold promise.
Dr. Gruber, the discussant, will integrate the presentations and discuss
the public health implications of these findings and the role of neuropsychology in helping prevent and treat SUDs.

S. TAPERT. Neurocognitive Predictors of Initiating Heavy Alcohol
Use during Adolescence.
Background: Underage drinking is a major public health and social
problem for adolescents in the US. Being able to identify an at-risk child
before they initiate heavy alcohol use could have immense clinical and
public health implications; however, few investigations have explored
individual-level precursors contributing to adolescent substance use.
This investigation combined machine learning with neuropsychological
(NP) data to determine whether we can predict heavy alcohol use initiation by age 18 in a group of substance-naïve adolescents.
Methods: Participants (N=137) were healthy alcohol-naïve adolescents
(ages 12-14) who underwent NP testing and structural and functional
magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI and fMRI) and were followed annually. By age 18, 71 youth (52%) initiated heavy alcohol use and 67
remained non-users. Random forest classification, a machine learning
tool, generated individual-subject alcohol use outcome predictions for
41 demographic, 26 NP, 68 sMRI, and 68 fMRI variables.
Results: The final random forest model was 75% accurate, with good
sensitivity (73%) and specificity (76%), and included 34 predictors
contributing to heavy alcohol use by age 18, including demographic
factors (e.g., being male, higher SES, early dating), worse NP performances (e.g., Digit Vigilance Test, Block Design, and Matrix Reasoning),
thinner cortices, and less brain activation in diffusely distributed brain
regions. Including the sMRI and fMRI variables increased the predictive
accuracy of the model from 65 to 75%.
Discussion: Together, random forest models and neuropsychological
data can provide individual-subject predictions of adolescent substance
use with a reasonably high level of accuracy. Moreover, this study helps
clarify the effects of a range of neurocognitive factors on initiating alcohol use during adolescence and suggests a mix of demographic, NP,
and neuroimaging indices could be integral in identifying youth at risk
for underage drinking.

J. JACOBUS, L.M. SQUEGLIA, N. CASTRO & S. TAPERT. The
Adolescent Brain Pre- and Post Alcohol and Marijuana Initiation.
Background: Marijuana use has become increasingly prevalent over the
past decade and changing legal policies have aroused public concern
about the potential for use to increase further among youth. The need
to understand its long-term effects on developing adolescent neuropsychological (NP) functioning has become increasingly important.
Methods: Participants (N=46) are healthy adolescents (ages 13-14) assessed prior to the onset of any substance use and again approximately
5 years later. Half initiated alcohol use and half initiated alcohol and
heavy marijuana use (i.e., minimum of 50 lifetime marijuana uses).
Groups were demographically matched and given the same NP, structural magnetic resonance imaging, and psychopathology measures at
the same ages.
Results: Increasing cognitive performance over time was observed for
both groups, however marijuana initiators did not show improved performance on some measures of processing speed post-baseline (ps<.05).
Adolescents who initiated alcohol and marijuana use post-baseline
showed significantly increasing externalizing symptomatology that was
not present at baseline (p<.05), and increased thickness estimates in
frontal brain regions by follow-up (ps<.05) compared to those who
initiated alcohol only by late adolescence/early adulthood.
Discussion: Based on this finding and prior studies from our laboratory,
it is hypothesized that ongoing analyses with larger sample sizes will
continue to show worse NP functioning and increased cortical thickness

93
in youth who initiated alcohol and marijuana use compared to alcohol
only by early adulthood. Heavy marijuana and alcohol use into young
adulthood may be associated with altered neural tissue development
that can have neurobehavioral consequences. Investigation pre- and
post-initiation of substance use will help us understand neural changes
that may be the result of problematic use versus pre-existing differences
that are also likely to play a role in neural outcomes.

and Substance Use in Emerging Adults.
Introduction: Emerging adulthood (ages 18-25) receives increasing attention as a distinct developmental stage. Heavy alcohol use is associated
with neuropsychological functioning such as risky decision-making; we
compare this in emerging adults (EA) and control adults (CA) using
an fMRI task.
Methods: 159 (64 F) EA reporting a wide range of alcohol, cigarette, and
cannabis use were included and compared to 101 (44 F) control adults
(CA) aged 26-31, matched to EA on gender and substance use. Scan
acquisition and preprocessing followed standard procedures.
Balloon Analogue Risk Task: Subjects may “pump” a simulated balloon,
with each inflation earning money, or cash-out before the balloon bursts
and winnings are lost. Subjects also pump “no-risk” control balloons
that never burst.
Behavioral results: Groups did not differ on the number of no-risk balloon pumps, but CA averaged fewer risk balloon pumps than EA (t =
-2.50; p=.01). Heavy drinking did not predict risk behavior (mean
risk – no-risk balloon pumps) in either group, even after controlling
for cannabis/cigarette use.
fMRI results: When analyzing EA and CA separately during risk-taking,
and controlling for cannabis/cigarette use, heavy drinking was associated with increased striatal activation in EA, but not CA. When comparing EA and CA risk-related differences directly, CA showed greater activation than EA in several regions, including the superior frontal gyrus.
Discussion: After matching on gender and substance use, CA took fewer
risks and showed greater prefrontal activation than EA during risk-taking. Heavy drinking was positively correlated with risk-related striatal
activation in EA but not CA. This suggests that compared to typical
adults, EA recruit less executive control during risk-taking, and that
their striatal response to risk-taking is more strongly related to drinking
behavior, which implicates targeted neuropsychological assessment and
treatment for younger adults with substance use disorders.

J. SCHACHT, K.E. VORONIN & R.F. ANTON. Dopaminergic
Genetic Effects on the Neural Correlates of Response Inhibition
Among Young Adults with Alcohol Use Disorder.
Impairments in neuropsychological function have been reported among
individuals with Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD), particularly for tasks
that require inhibition of prepotent responses, and impaired function
impedes successful AUD treatment. Dopamine (DA) signaling in the
prefrontal cortex (PFC) is one of several neurochemical influences on
neuropsychological function, and both low and high DA tone are associated with poor function. In the PFC, DA is primarily inactivated
by the enzyme catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT). The val158met
single nucleotide polymorphism in the COMT gene is associated with
differential COMT function, such that val-allele homozygotes, relative
to heterozygotes, display increased enzymatic activity and lower PFC
DA, while met-allele homozygotes display the opposite phenotype. This
study examined the effects of val158met genotype on brain activation
associated with response inhibition among 35 young adults with AUD.
Subjects were genotyped and completed an fMRI response inhibition
(stop-signal) task after 7 days of treatment with the DA partial agonist

94
aripiprazole or placebo. Irrespective of treatment group, COMT genotype moderated activation associated with successful response inhibition
in several cortical areas, including the dorsomedial PFC and inferior
frontal gyri (cluster-corrected p < .05), such that both val- and met-allele homozygotes displayed weaker activation than heterozygotes. Although the study blind will not be broken until December 2015, analyses
conducted with A/B treatment coding suggested that COMT genotype
also moderated treatment effects on task-related activation. Preliminarily, these data suggest that DAergic genetic variation affects neuropsychological function in AUD, as well as pharmacological attempts
to remediate such function. Consideration of genetic differences may
ultimately allow the development of individualized treatments that selectively target neuropsychological function, an integral aspect of AUD.

Symposium 4. Chaotic Order, Language
Connectivity, and a Generalizing Treatment of
Aphasia
Chair: Stephen E. Nadeau

12:45–2:15 p.m.
S.E. NADEAU. Chaotic Order, Language Connectivity, and a
Generalizing Treatment of Aphasia.
Symposium Description: The predominant source of order in multicellular living organisms is chaotic order—order that emerges from the dynamic interaction of large numbers of interacting units and determines
both form and function. In the brain, representations are population
encoded, that is, they reflect the combined activity of large numbers of
units (neurons, micro-columns) that are extensively connected with each
other. Knowledge resides in the connections (synapses). Dr. Nadeau will
begin this symposium with a discussion of neural mechanisms underlying phonologic and semantic function that relies heavily on the science
of population encoded representations—parallel distributed processing.
He will conclude with a brief introduction to neural mechanisms underlying grammatic function. These posited mechanisms make strong
predictions about the connectivity of Broca’s region, predictions that
have been born out in high angular diffusion imaging (HARDI) studies
of the neural connectivity underlying language function, to be presented
by Dr. Bohsali in the second part of this symposium. Evidence from
aphasia studies also suggests that there are both phonological and whole
word networks that translate concept representations into word form,
and that there are at least two perisylvian networks that support sublexical and word sequence knowledge, one phonologic, one involving
grammatic morphology. Dr. Bohsali’s work confirms both hypotheses.
Finally, the comprehensive model of language presented here provides
clear insight into why treatments for anomia following stroke have
shown so little evidence of generalization to untrained exemplars or
daily verbal communication, even as it demonstrates opportunities for
the development of aphasia therapies that will generalize. Dr. Kendall
will conclude the symposium with a discussion of a therapy she has
developed, phonomotor, and clinical trial evidence of its efficacy and
capacity for generalization.

S.E. NADEAU. Language Function Through the Lens of Population
Encoding and Parallel Distributed Processing.
Our conceptualization of the neural basis of language function still relies
heavily on the Wernicke-Lichtheim model. However, this model provides no basis for understanding the nature of representations in the

various domains of the model, or the nature of the processes occurring
between domains. The science of parallel distributed processing (PDP),
which is predicated on population encoding of representations, has provide enormous insight into the fundamental mechanisms involved. PDP
models have been subjected to extensive computer simulations and have
demonstrated an enormous capacity for replicating normal human behavior. When damaged in various ways, they also replicate the behavior
of individuals with brain damage. Rehabilitation studies of damaged
computer simulated networks have made startling predictions that have
later been born out in human subject studies. This presentation will
begin with a discussion of how meaning (semantics) can be supported
by population encoded representations, how this PDP conceptualization
provides a logical explanation for the errors and error types exhibited by
patients with aphasia, and how it can be reconciled with evidence from
cognitive neuropsychology that semantics is represented in specialized
forms in disparate brain regions. The second portion of the presentation
will introduce the neural basis for phonology and the neural network
capacity for encoding of phonologic sequence knowledge. The presentation will conclude with a brief introduction to the multicomponent
representation of grammatic function in the brain and the predictions
it makes for neural connectivity underlying language function.

A. BOHSALI. Neural Connectivity Underlying Language Function.
We employed high angular diffusion imaging (HARDI) to map neural
connectivity underlying language function in 18 normal young male
participants, guided by hypotheses borne of the language literature.
HARDI substantially transcends problems mapping fibers that take
sharp bends or cross other pathways that afflict older diffusion tractography methods, thereby enabling direct mapping between cortical
regions. We found extensive interconnectivity between the 3 established
components of Broca’s region (BR), pars orbitalis, pars triangularis, and
pars opercularis, and between these components and ventral portions
of area 6. All 4 regions connect extensively via a topographically organized, anterior to posterior dispersion of fibers, to middle and superior
temporal gyri. Studies from aphasia suggest at least 2 major connections between BR and post-central cortices, one supporting naming
from semantic representations via a phonological route and one via a
whole word route. They also suggest more than one anterior to posterior
network supporting sequence knowledge, one primarily instantiating
phonologic sequence knowledge, the other knowledge of grammatic
morphologic sequence and phrase structure rules. Our results provide
strong support for these hypotheses. We discovered 2 very large pathways that plausibly support sublexical sequence knowledge, one linking
pars opercularis and Wernicke’s area via the extreme capsule, one linking inferior area 6 to inferior portions of the supramarginal gyrus via
a supra-Sylvian pathway. We also found extensive connectivity, likely
involving the arcuate fasciculus, between pars opercularis, area 6, and
temporal cortices linked to semantic function, including ventral area
22, area 21, and area 20. We found very limited connections between
BR, mainly pars orbitalis and pars triangularis, and cortices plausibly
supporting semantic function, traveling via the uncinate fasciculus and
the occipito-temporal-frontal fasciculus.

D.L. KENDALL. Phonomotor Therapy: an Intrinsically
Generalizing Approach to Aphasia Therapy.
Anomia, the most common and disabling component of aphasia after
stroke, is typically remediated using whole words and tasks such as confrontation naming, repetition, phonologic cueing, and picture matching.
While these traditional aphasia therapies improve naming performance,
knowledge gained tends to be limited to words actually trained and there
is, at best, very limited improvement in performance with untrained

Forty Fourth Annual INS Meeting Abstracts
words (Edmonds, Nadeau & Kiran, 2009; McNeil et al. 1997; Nickels,
2002; Wisenburn & Mahoney, 2009). The potential for generalization
is doomed to be modest if treatment is focused on neural networks
that link substantially orthogonal domains of knowledge (e.g., word
meaning and word sound) and therefore encode few regularities. New
approaches that circumvent this limitation by focusing on knowledge
domains characterized by extensive regularities are being developed
and show considerable promise. One treatment, called phonomotor,
is inspired by a parallel distributed processing (PDP) model of lexical
processing. Because of the extensive regularities in phonological sequence knowledge, training of a subset of sequences can generalize to
all native sequences. Because phonologic sequence knowledge is engaged
in the production of all words, such training can also generalize to untrained exemplars. Through intensive, multi-modal (auditory, motor,
orthographic, tactile-kinesthetic, and conceptual) training of phonemes
and 1-, 2- and 3-syllable real- and nonword phoneme sequences, the
neural connectivity supporting phoneme sequence knowledge can be
enhanced and word retrieval improved. Data from our open trial of
60 hours of phonomotor in 26 participants suggest that the treatment
improves confrontation naming performance on trained words and
generalizes to naming of untrained words at 3 months post treatment
termination, to some aspects of discourse production, and to indicators
of quality of life (Kendall et al, 2008, Kendall et al 2012, Kendall 2015).

R.L. BUCKNER & T. HEDDEN. The ready brain: Amyloid burden
alters the longitudinal relationship of performance to neural
responses during task anticipation and execution.
Objective: This study tested how amyloid burden in cognitively
healthy older adults alters the longitudinal relationship between performance and brain activity during anticipatory or execution phases of
a rule-switching task. We predicted that individuals with higher baseline
amyloid burden would exhibit an altered relationship between activity
and performance over time.
Participants and Methods: Participants were 102 healthy older adults
(baseline age 66-85) from the Harvard Aging Brain Study. Cortical
amyloid burden was measured at baseline with Pittsburgh Compound
B. Participants performed a rule-switching in-scanner task where they
were cued to respond to the size, shape or color of each stimulus. Brain
activity was measured at baseline and 3-year follow-up in a priori prefrontal and parietal regions during the anticipatory and execution phases
of each task block in a 3-Tesla fMRI scan. Task accuracy and switch
costs were measured behaviorally. Analyses focused on the effect of
amyloid burden on associations between behavioral performance and
brain activity during each task phase over time.
Results: Behaviorally, individuals with higher amyloid at baseline
showed increasing switch costs over time. In higher amyloid individuals, lower anticipatory activity at baseline was associated with increased
switch costs over time, while increased execution activity over time was
associated with increased switch costs over time. In contrast, individuals
with lower amyloid burden at baseline had lower switch costs, higher
baseline anticipatory activity, and did not show a relationship between
switch costs and activity.
Conclusions: These results indicate that amyloid burden alters the
relationship between anticipatory versus execution-related brain activity
and performance during a rule-switching task. Amyloid burden may
have longitudinal effects on executive function that impact the ability

95
to anticipate and respond to rule switches, in addition to its well-studied
relationships to episodic memory.

The Effect of Blood Pressure on Processing Speed and White
Matter Microstructure Abnormalities in Healthy Older Adults.
Objective: Hypertension in middle age is associated with worse cognitive performance, white matter disease, and increased probability of
dementia. Evidence for an association between hypertension and worse
neurocognitive outcomes in late-life is mixed. Less is known about the
effect of mild elevations in blood pressure on cognition and white matter disease in older healthy adults. We investigated the effect of blood
pressure on cognitive and white matter microstructure change over time
in sample of largely (72%) normotensive non-demented older adults.
Participants and Methods: Ninety-eight older adults aged 75+ free
of neurological disease, unstable cardiovascular disease, and significant
cognitive impairment (i.e., Mini-Mental State Examination score ≥ 24)
completed measures of executive functioning / processing speed and diffusion tensor imaging (fractional anisotropy; FA) of the corpus callosum
and periventricular pathways . Twenty-four hour ambulatory systolic
blood pressure (ABP) was also recorded. Participant s completed all
measures at baseline and two years later. A series of mixed-effects linear
models were computed to analyze the effect of baseline systolic blood
pressure on cognition and DTI values at baseline and two year follow-up.
These models included main fixed effects for time and blood pressure,
their interaction, and random intercepts using maximum likelihood estimates. Age, gender, and education were included as covariates.
Results: Linear modeling revealed time by blood pressure interactions
for measures of processing speed (Coding;p = .04 ) and sustained attention (CPT; p =.02) as well as FA of the splenium (p = .01) and cingulate-hippocampal tract (p = .01). Elevated blood pressure at baseline
was associated with worse neurocognitive outcome over time. Models
with executive functioning measures were not significant.
Conclusions: Even subtle elevations in blood pressure can detrimentally impact cognition and white matter integrity in older healthy adults.

Sociodemographic and cognitive predictors of memory trajectories
across educational groups.
Objective: Low educational attainment is a risk factor for more rapid
cognitive aging, but there is substantial variability in cognitive trajectories within educational groups. The aim of this study was to determine
the factors that confer resilience to memory decline within educational
strata.
Participants and Methods: We selected 2592 initially non-demented
White, Black, and Hispanic participants from the longitudinal community-based Washington Heights/Inwood Columbia Aging Project who
had at least two visits. Trajectory of memory was represented as the
probability of belonging to a stable-high memory class (range=0-1),
extracted from a growth mixture model. Educational attainment groups
were classified as Low (≤5 years), Medium (6-11 years) and High (≥12
years). Multiple group regression analyses determined if the relationship
of sociodemographic (age, race/ethnicity and gender), cognitive (composite scores for executive, language/semantic and visuospatial tests)
and reading level predictors differed across the groups.
Results: Predictors of memory trajectory significantly differed across
educational strata.The best predictors of high and stable memory performance in the Low education group were higher reading ability, better
language/semantic scores and being female; for the Medium group were

96
higher scores on executive and language/semantic tests, being female
and younger age. Among the High group, predictors were the same as
for the Medium group and being non-Hispanic White was an additional
predictor.
Conclusions: Although people with very few years of education are
at higher risk for cognitive decline and dementia, our results suggest
that regardless of age and race, reading level and language skills may
represent potential sources of developing cognitive resilience in people
with fewer than 6 years of school. We found that cognitive resilience
factors differ across educational strata, and thus potential intervention
targets may be more effective if they are specifically tailored depending
on educational experience.

Cognitive Performance across Mid and Late Adulthood: Analyses
in Two Cohort Studies.
Objective: Racial disparities exist for health and cognitive outcomes
across the lifespan. Many physical health disparities appear less prominent in late life, which is likely due to higher mortality rates for African Americans. This study examined whether this attenuation of racial
disparities at older ages observed for physical health outcomes can be
extended to cognitive outcomes in mid-life and late-life samples. Evidence of selective survival with respect to cognition would imply that
conventional risk factor patterns for dementia may be distorted among
older African Americans, and clinical predictions based on less selected
white peers will be inaccurate.
Participants and Methods: Z-score composites of executive functioning and episodic memory were computed for 3,857 (10.5% African
American; median age 57) participants in Midlife in the United States
(MIDUS) and 2,729 (53.8% African American; median age 75) participants in the Washington Heights-Inwood Columbia Aging Project
(WHICAP). Cross-sectional associations between race and cognition
were examined as a function of age.
Results: Independent of main effects of age, birth cohort, sex, education and chronic health conditions, significant age by race interactions
indicated that racial disparities in both domains were larger at younger
ages than older ages in both samples. Independent associations between African American race and cognition in younger vs. older ages
were -0.420 vs. -0.333 for memory and -0.855 vs. -0.673 for executive
functioning in MIDUS; -0.398 vs. -0.264 for memory and -0.463 vs.
-0.324 for executive functioning in WHICAP.
Conclusions: Attenuation of racial inequalities at older ages can be
extended to cognitive outcomes, which likely reflects selective survival.
Research on cognitive disparities or on race-specific causes of cognitive
outcomes in old age must incorporate corrections for selective survival
if the goal is to identify causal predictors of cognitive outcomes, rather
than merely statistical predictors.

Plenary C. Modulating Brain Networks to Promote
Recovery from Brain Injury
Presenter: Alvaro Pascual-Leone

2:30–3:30 p.m.
A. PASCUAL-LEONE. Modulating Brain Networks to Promote
Recovery from Brain Injury.
Following a brain insult (e.g. following a stroke or traumatic brain
injury), or as a consequence of the alteration of function in a specific
brain region (for example due to a sustained change in afferent input or
efferent demand), the affected neural network adapts fluidly. This neural plasticity can confer no perceptible change in the behavioral output
of the brain, lead to changes demonstrated only under special testing
conditions, or cause behavioral changes that may constitute symptoms
of disease or represent paradoxical functional facilitations. A consequence of such a formulation is the notion that the manifestations of
focal brain dysfunction are ultimately defined by brain plasticity. Thus,
disability after a brain insult, is the consequence of plasticity, just as
through plasticity it might be possible to recover from the functional
consequences of a brain insult.
The challenge in interventional cognitive neuroscience and rehabilitation is to guide the plastic changes across the lifespan, or following a
brain insult, in order to promote the best functional outcome for a given
individual. This requires modulation of neural networks. The challenge
is to learn enough about the mechanisms of plasticity and the nature of
dynamics of neural networks to be able to suppress changes that may
lead to undesirable behaviors while accelerating or enhancing those that
result in a behavioral benefit for the patient. Neurostimulation, including non-invasive brain stimulation techniques, provide an opportunity
to modulate plastic brain networks in a controlled and specific manner,
and a growing body of evidence supports its utility in promoting recovery of function after a brain injury.
Learning objectives:
1. Explain the brain networks.
2. Discuss the localization of dysfunction and symptoms as a consequence of network impact of a lesion
3. Demonstrate the feasibility of modulating brain networks and discuss
approaches to do so.
4. Discuss implications of modulating brain networks for recovery from
injury.

Parent and Teacher Reports of Adaptive Behavior: A Diagnostic
Perspective on Special Education Students.
Objective: Since adaptive behavior determines the severity of an intellectual disability diagnosis in DSM-V, accurate measurement of this
construct is essential. Though the ABAS-II manual reported high parent-teacher correlations among typically developing children (Harrison
& Oakland, 2003), discrepancies in parent and teacher report of children with neurodevelopmental disorders are common on other adaptive

behavior measures (e.g., VABS; Hundert et al., 1997). The present study
investigated if parent-teacher concordance on the ABAS-II is lower when
children in special education are rated, relative to typically developing
children. Lower agreement between raters in this population may complicate diagnostic formulation.
Participants and Methods: Subjects included 93 students with parent
and teacher ABAS-II ratings archived from evaluations at 2 special education schools. The sample was 83% male, primarily Caucasian (56%)
or African American (31%), and 13.6 (SD=3.5) years old on average.
Autism (58%), Other Health Impairment (20%), and Emotional Disability (15%) were the most common special education classifications.
Estimated cognitive functioning was in the borderline range, on average
(M=76, SD=19).
Results: Correlations between parent and teacher reports of adaptive behavior were moderate (composite r’s ranged from .32-.46) and
smaller than those reported in the test manual (z’s>1.88, p’s<.061).
At the group level, parents rated their children as having poorer overall adaptive skill than did teachers (t(91)=-2.31, p<.05, d=-0.26). At
the individual level, the differences between parent and teacher scores
averaged about 1 standard deviation. For diagnostic purposes, using a
General Adaptive Composite below 70 as a cutoff, 34% of parents and
teachers disagreed on children’s adaptive skills, with parents endorsing
impairment more often than teachers.
Conclusions: These results highlight the importance of obtaining multiple perspectives in the diagnosis and educational planning of students
with neurodevelopmental disorders.

validity of these measures is unclear, making clinical interpretation
difficult. This study aims to examine whether performance on objective
EF measures predict parent and teacher rated EF.
Participants and Methods: We examined data from 53 children (ages
8-18) referred for neuropsychological evaluation from 2008-2015. EF
was assessed via Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function
(BRIEF) parent (P) and teacher (T) ratings and objective measures
that assess at least one aspect of EF measured by the BRIEF (D-KEFS
subtests, CPT-II, WISC-IV subtests, Hooper Visual Organization Test
(HVOT), Children’s Category Test, and CVLT-C).
Results: BRIEF-P and -T Behavioral Regulation (BRI) and Global Executive Composite (GEC), but not Metacognition (MCI), scores were
significantly correlated (p<.05). Multiple regression analyses were used
to determine factors that predict BRIEF index scores. CPT-II commissions, HVOT, and DKEFS Trail Making Test (TMT) 4 scores accounted
for a significant amount of the variance of GEC scores (p<.05). WISC-IV
digit span (forward and backward) and CPT-II (commissions and block
change standard errors) explained a significant amount of the variance
of BRI scores (p<.05). MCI scores were not predicted by any objective
measures. However, several objective measures significantly predicted
individual MCI and BRI subscales.
Conclusions: CPT-II, WISC-IV digit span, DKEFS TMT, and HVOT
emerged as the most robust predictors of BRIEF-P and -T ratings. These
findings suggest that these specific EF measures capture concepts that
are generalizable to various applied academic and behavioral contexts.
Implications of these findings will be discussed.

of a Self-Regulation Subscale Using Specific Items From the
Behavior Rating Scale of the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler
Development.
Objective: To develop a standardized instrument to measure self-regulation in early childhood.
Participants and Methods: This study describes the development of a
Self-Regulation Subscale using specific items from the Behavior Rating
Scale of the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development. We
selected items based on existing literature describing development of
self-regulatory capacity in early childhood. A sample of normal subjects
(n = 77) age 36 months was used to test validity of findings.
Results: The Self-Regulation Subscale demonstrated good psychometric
properties (mean = 40.12, sd = 4.11). It was found to have high convergent validity, as there were significant positive associations (p < 0.05)
with Bayley Mental Development Index (MDI) scores at 12 months and
sibling Child Behavior Checklist Deficient Emotional Self-Regulation
(CBCL DESR) scores at 9 years.
Conclusions: The Subscale may be useful in assessing the development of self-regulatory capacities in early childhood. Significant positive
associations with MDI and DESR scores are consistent with existing
literature indicating that the development of self-regulatory capacity is
continuous and does not stabilize until 9 years. Future research should
investigate reliability and discriminant validity of the Subscale, as well
as clinical implications.

M. BONINO & A.L. FERNANDEZ. Reliability of the Test de
Velocidad de Denominación for Early Detection of Dyslexia.
Objective: The Test de Velocidad de Denominación (TVD) was developed in order to measure naming speed in children between 4 and 9
years old. Naming speed is an early indicator of children at risk of developing dyslexia. This study was designed to estimate the reliability of
the Test de Velocidad de Denominación (TVD) with a test-retest design
in a sample of children from pre-school and primary school
Participants and Methods: The TVD was administered twice to a
sample of 93 children between 4 and 8 years old. Mean time between
administrations was 7.13 ± 0.52 days. All of the children attended to
two public schools in Cordoba city, Argentina. The correlation coefficient was calculated in order to assess the test stability. Learning effect
between test administrations was assessed with a mean differences t-test.
Results: The mean score for the test was 79.19 ± 30.47 seconds, and
71.8 ± 22.4 for the retest. Pearson’s r correlation coefficient was .93.
The difference between test and retest means was statistically significant
(p= 0.000).
Conclusions: The TVD has an excellent stability. The significant learning effect suggests that an alternative form should be developed to be
used when individuals need to be assessed more than once.

of Demographic Variables on a Speed Naming Test For SpanishSpeaking Children- The “Test de Velocidad de Denominación”
Objective: The Test de Velocidad de Denominación (TVD) was developed in order to measure naming speed in children between 4 and
9 years old. Naming speed is an early indicator of children at risk of
developing dyslexia. Validity studies were presented previously. In this
poster data are presented on the normative data and the influence of
demographic variables on time to complete the test.
Participants and Methods: Six-hundred and seventy eight children from public (20%) and private (80%) schools of Cordoba city,

98
Argentina, were included. Children were from pre-school and primary
(up to 3rd grade) school. Forty-eight percent were female.
Results: Mean time to complete the test decreased significantly as children progressed in school (p=0.0000; eta^2=0.41). The most significant decrease was between the last pre-school year and 1st grade. An
ANCOVA showed that children from private schools had significantly
shorter times than those of public schools but only during the pre-school
years. Parents educational level had an influence on the TVD scores only
if they had less than 12 years of school. No significant differences were
found between male and female.
Conclusions: These data confirm that naming speed decreases as the
children grow/progress in school. There is a feedback between naming
speed and learning to read: an adequate naming speed ensures an appropriate learning to read process, but learning to read improves naming speed, in return. Socio-economic variables play an important role
possibly influencing early cognitive stimulation; however, the schooling
process seems to level the pre-existent differences.

Psychometric properties of the Questionnaire of Executive SelfAwareness (QESA) for Children.
Objective: People with an accurate representation of their own cognitive functioning (i.e., cognitive self-awareness) are more likely to
make use of appropriate strategies to regulate their behavior in dayto-day life. However, due to the lack of appropriate instruments to
appraise self-awareness, few studies have examined the development
of this ability among children. The aim of the present study is to test
the measurement properties of the self-rating and other-rating form of
the Questionnaire of Executive Self-Awareness (QESA) designed to tap
children’s knowledge of their executive functioning.
Participants and Methods: Participants were 317 typically developing children aged from 7 to 14 years old. A group of 29 children who
had sustained moderate to severe TBI from closed head trauma also
participated in the study.
Results: Confirmatory factor analyses carried out on the QESA confirmed the eight-factor structure of the two versions of the scale. Convergent validity was revealed with significant correlations between the
QESA and the parent version of the BRIEF, the DEX-C, and the CHEXI.
The two forms of the QESA were also shown to be able to distinguish
between children who sustained a traumatic brain injury (TBI) and
control participants. Finally, a self-other discrepancy score was computed to assess children’s level of executive self-awareness. A statistical
difference was observed between the TBI groups and the control group
on the latter score, suggesting that self-awareness impairments could
be a consequence of TBI in children.
Conclusions: Overall, the good psychometric properties of the scale
were established.

M. MESSER, J. GREENE, P.K. ISQUITH, G.A. GIOIA,
L. KENWORTHY & S. GUY. Behavior Rating Inventory of
Executive Function, Second Edition (BRIEF2): Analyzing and
Interpreting Ratings from Multiple Raters.
Objective: We examined the correlations, mean differences, and calculated the percentage of sample obtaining various T-Score differences on
the BRIEF2 among various interrater dyad samples (parent, teacher,
and self-report).
Participants and Methods: BRIEF2 interrater reliability was assessed
in subsamples of the typically developing (TD) standardization sample
(n = 115-632) and the combined clinical sample (n = 287-1,426). This
included examining the correlations between dyads of raters for a subsample of matched raters. In addition, effect size for mean differences
were calculated for each BRIEF2 scale and index. Percentages of these

samples that obtained various T-Score differences on the Index scores
and GEC score were calculated.
Results: Overall, the correlations between raters are moder¬ate to
strong for TD children and low to moderate for clinical groups. The
mean differences between BRIEF2 scores are relatively small. For parent
and teacher ratings, approximately 53-59% of cases reported scores
within 10 T-score points. As expected the agreement of the parent–
parent sample was higher, with approximately 67-76% of being within
10 T-score points. Agreement in the Teacher–Teacher sample was even
higher, with approximately 70-76% of cases bring within 10 T-score
points of each other. Agreement within 10 T-score points for adolescents
when compared to parents and teachers ratings was approximately 5863% and 51-59% of cases, respectively.
Conclusions: Pairs of raters with similar perspectives, namely, parent–
parent and teacher–teacher, tend to be correlated more highly than raters who see the child from different perspectives. The lowest correlations
were seen between adolescent and either parents or teachers. Gathering
multiple perspectives in the assessment of a child’s functioning provides
a more comprehensive set of data. An interpretive strategy that includes
comparison of dyads or triads of raters’ views is desirable.

M.J. HAMBERGER, M. SMITH, W.S. MACALLISTER,
A.C. WILLIAMS & W.T. SEIDEL. Auditory and Visual Naming
Tests for Children.
Objective: The most commonly used naming measure for children has
been the Boston Naming Test (BNT). However, this test was developed
for adults and its use with children is problematic due to: 1) inclusion of
uncommon, low frequency items (e.g., yoke), confounding naming assessment with vocabulary, 2) use of line drawings, adding the potential
confound of perceptual processing, and 3), lack of normative data for
delayed or cued responses, both of which reflect naming difficulty. Further, the BNT, like most naming measures, is limited to visual naming.
Considerable work has shown greater sensitivity of auditory description
naming in identifying temporal lobe based naming deficits in adults.
We aimed to develop complementary visual (VN) and auditory naming
(AN) tests for children, ages 6-15 years, addressing these and other
shortcomings in current naming tests for children.
Participants and Methods: Participants were 182 healthy children
(106 girls) who were administered the 36-item AN and VN tests, WASI,
WIAT Reading, and Digit Span. AN and VN items were comparable
in word frequency and familiarity. Performance measures included
accuracy, mean RT, and Tip-of-the-tongue (‘TOT’=responses ^2 sec
+ items requiring phonemic cue). Data were stratified by 2-year age
intervals for analysis.
Results: Multivariate ANOVA revealed no differences among age groups
in IQ or standardized reading scores (P>.05). AN and VN accuracy
scores were also comparable across groups, except for children ages
6-7 earning significantly lower scores than other groups. AN and VN
RT and TOT scores were lower in age groups 6-7 and 8-9 (P < .05);
however, scores were comparable among children age 10 and older.
Pearson correlations indicated naming performance was unrelated to
gender, reading and digit span scores.
Conclusions: Naming, as assessed by both auditory and visual cues,
appears to stabilize after age 9 years. Overall, preliminary results suggest
that these AN and VN tests promise age appropriate naming measures
for school aged children. NIHNS35140(MH)

Forty Fourth Annual INS Meeting Abstracts
D.J. HINDS, J.H. BERNSTEIN & F. YOUSSEF. Taking the (NIH)
Toolbox to Trinidad and Tobago.
Objective: 1. Assess the use of the Toolbox (TB) in Trinidad & Tobago
(T&T). 2. Document cognitive, language and social-emotional characteristics of children entering primary school.
Participants and Methods: 68 children (34 M) entering primary school
in 5 schools in Port-of-Spain and their parents. Age range: 4y10mo–
6y7mo. Children were seen individually at school using the Kindergarten
Language Screening Test, 2nd Edition (KSLT2) and the TB Cognitive
Battery. Parents completed social and emotional questionnaires.
Results: 67.6% of children completed all 7 TB tasks, providing analyzable data; 6 tasks = 82.3%, 5 = 92.6%, 4 = 98.5%. Failures resulted
from limited attention and inability to get into task set. Obtaining completed questionnaires from parents was a challenge (34% responses).
Initial analyses of TB data yielded main effects for gender, age group
and school community. Girls were better readers: Oral Reading F (1,
66) = 4.45, p < .05. Age group differences were found in Oral Reading
F (4, 62) = 10.85, p < .001; Flanker F (4, 61) = 3.22, p < .05; Picture
Sequence Memory F (4, 50) = 3.08, p < .05; Picture Vocabulary F (4,
62) = 3.21, p < .05; KLST2 F (4, 62) = 3.50, p < .05. School differences
were found in List Sorting F (4, 41) = 3.02, p < .05; Picture Sequence
Memory F (4, 53) = 5.04, p < .01. TB language measures (Oral Reading - r(68) = .49, p < .001; Picture Vocabulary - r(68) = .43, p < .001)
were significantly correlated with the KLST2.
Conclusions: These initial results indicate that the TB can be successfully used in a non-US setting. TB language scores correlate with those
from the KLST2. Culture-specific factors such as school community
play a role in children’s performance. Lessons learned: need to adapt
research requirements to local setting; impact of variable literacy levels
on recruitment, consent, data collection; implications for future funding
requests.

& K.R. KRULL. Functional consequence of cognitive impairment
in long-term survivors of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia
(ALL): the role of cancer symptoms.
Objective: To examine the association of cognitive impairment with
cancer symptoms and daily functional status in childhood ALL survivors
treated on a chemotherapy only protocol.
Participants and Methods: 213 survivors (mean age=14.8 years;
time since diagnosis=7.7 years) were assessed at >5 years post-diagnosis. Testing included measures of executive function (Delis-Kaplan
Executive Function System; Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-IV
[WISC-IV]), processing speed (WISC-IV; Grooved Pegboard), visual-spatial processing (Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence),
memory span (WISC-IV), and attention (Conners CPT-II). Symptoms
(e.g., pain, worry, cognitive, communication) and daily functional status
(physical, emotional, social, school) were reported by parents using the
PedsQL. Association of cognitive impairment with symptoms and functional status was tested using regression analysis. The extent to which
cognitive impairment influences functional status through symptoms
was tested using mediation analysis.
Results: Cognitive impairment (>1SD below age-adjusted norm) was
identified in 18-41% of the survivors. Impaired executive function,
processing speed, and memory span were associated with high cancer symptoms (all p’s<0.05), typically driven by perceived cognitive
and communication problems. Impaired executive function, processing
speed, visual-spatial processing, and memory span were associated with
poor functional status (all p’s<0.05). In each cognitive domain impairment was associated with poor school function (all p’s<0.05). Impact
of cognitive function (except attention) on overall functional status was
mediated by overall cancer symptoms (all p’s<0.05).
Conclusions: Although the frequency of impairment in survivors
treated with chemotherapy was less than that seen with radiation therapy, cognitive impairment is related to elevated cancer symptoms and
decreased functional status. Mediation analyses indicate that cognitive
function works through cancer symptoms to impact functional status.

A.M. O’BRIEN & J.E. CASEY. Test-Retest Reliability of the ImPACT
with a Canadian Sample of Healthy Young Athletes.
Objective: Although baseline neurocognitive assessments are highly
recommended for tracking concussions in athletes who play high-risk
sports, there are currently no measures available specifically for use
with children. The most widely used assessment tool, the Immediate
Post-concussion Assessment and Cognitive Testing (ImPACT), was
developed for adults. According to the test manual it can also be used
with children as young as 11 years old. Despite this assertion, there is no
published study regarding the psychometric properties of the ImPACT in
children younger than high-school age. The purpose of the present study
was to determine the two-week test-retest reliability of the ImPACT
neurocognitive test in a healthy sample of young athletes.
Participants and Methods: Participants (n=34) included healthy
Canadian athletes ages 11-14 (15% female) that had not sustained a
concussion within the previous three months. Participants completed
the baseline ImPACT neurocognitive test and then returned for a re-test
approximately 14 days later (M=14.32, SD=1.55).
Results: Overall, the ImPACT neurocognitive test has at least fair
test-retest reliability with intraclass correlation coefficients for absolute agreement ranging from 0.36 to 0.75. In addition, the standard
error of measurement (SEM) was calculated and revealed that some
composite scores were more accurate than others with SEMs ranging
from 0.07 to 9.44. The Visual-Motor Speed composite demonstrated
the highest reliability.
Conclusions: The study demonstrates that the ImPACT neurocognitive
test may be appropriate for use with children as young as 11 years
old based on test-retest reliability at a 14-day interval. The accuracy
of scores, however, varies depending on the composite scores. These
findings provide some psychometric support for the use of the ImPACT
with athletes younger than high-school age and emphasize its use only
as part of a comprehensive baseline evaluation.

I. O’DESKY, B. FECHTER, D. COLOGNORI & D. MARKS. Use of
Executive Functioning as a Predictor of ADHD and NLD.
Objective: Children with NLD are often diagnosed with ADHD. Research suggests that attention problems in NLD may result from issues
distinct from those in ADHD and differences in executive functioning
(EF) could help differentiate these groups. It was hypothesized that
subjects meeting screening criteria for ADHD would differ significantly
from subjects meeting screening criteria for NLD on four measures
of EF used on the NEPSY-II(Animal Sorting, Auditory Attention and
Response Set and Design Fluency)and that performance on EF tasks
of visual-spatial reasoning would predict NLD while performance on
measures of attention would predict ADHD.
Participants and Methods: Participants completed an extensive battery of cognitive functioning. NLD Screening Criteria included a VCI
>PRI by at least 15 points on the WISC-IV and impaired score on
the Rey-Osterrieth Complex Figure Test. ADHD-I Screening Criteria
included a CPT-II score ≥ 70 and T-score ≥ 60 on the Conners 3 Inattention scale.
Results: 20 subjects met NLD criteria and 17 subjects met ADHD-PI
criteria. In support of the first hypothesis, groups differed significantly
on the Design Fluency task, p = .02. In support of the second hypothesis, a model including the four NEPSY-II subtests was significant, p <
.01. When predicting ADHD, a model including the four subtests was
not significant, p = .880 and no individual subtests were predictors.
Post-hoc analyses showed that verbal fluency semantic, p = .896 and
phonemic, p = .891 did not predict NLD.

100
Conclusions: Children with NLD and ADHD both present with EF
deficits. Results suggest that those with NLD may be more likely to show
EF deficits in visual-spatial area. This distinction is important as NLD
and ADHD may present similarly but the etiologies of their attention
problem may be different. Design Fluency scores may be helpful for
differential diagnosis of ADHD and NLD and this can help ensure that
the child receives relevant interventions and accommodations.

T.W. OLIVIER, B. SHIEH, R. PLOTKIN, L.A. JACOBSON &
J. REESMAN. Preliminary Examination of WISC-V Indices in a
Clinical Sample of Children with Hearing Loss.
Objective: Multiple studies have examined use of previous versions
of the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (WISC) with children
who have hearing loss, with results suggesting it is useful within this
population (Krouse & Braden, 2011). With the release of the WISC-V,
additional research is needed to examine performance patterns given
this population’s unique concerns (Reesman et al., 2014). No studies to
date have examined WISC-V performance in children with hearing loss.
Participants and Methods: Performance on the WISC-V was examined in a retrospective review of children with and without hearing
loss referred for evaluation to a large urban neuropsychology department with a specialty clinic for hearing loss. Our sample included 10
children (7 male) ages 7 to 14 (M=11.29, SD=7.51), all with hearing
loss (sensorineural n=3; conductive n=5, mixed n=2). Three children
used auditory supports (hearing aid n=2, cochlear implant n=1). An
age- and gender-matched clinical sample without hearing loss was used
for comparison (n = 10).Instructions were presented using the child’s
language preference.
Results: Independent samples t-tests examined group differences on
WISC-V indices between children with hearing loss and controls. Results
revealed no significant differences (p > .05) between the groups on
WISC-V Full Scale IQ [(M=89.90, SD=15.60), t(18) = .032]; Verbal
Comprehension [(M=87.10, SD=15.31), t(18) = .921]; Visual Spatial
[(M=94.80, SD=22.17), t(18) = - .013]; Fluid Reasoning [(M=91.60,
SD=18.72), t(18) = .696]; Working Memory [(M=91.20, SD=13.57),
t(18) = - .760]; or Processing Speed [(M=89.10, SD=22.08), t(18) =
.230] indices.
Conclusions: This study provides preliminary support of the hypothesis
that clinically-referred children with hearing loss earn similar scores
on the WISC-V when compared to clinically-referred hearing peers.
Given the heterogeneous nature of hearing loss, these findings should be
replicated and extended with larger, more diverse samples of children
with hearing loss compared to hearing peers.

A Comparison of Two Prospective Memory Tests in Clinically
Referred Children: Influence of Distracter Task.
Objective: Prospective Memory (PM) has become an increasing focus of
research with both typically developing and clinically referred children.
This study is part of an effort to produce a convenient and ecologically
valid measure of PM that can be incorporated into the neuropsychological examination. The Prospective Memory Screening (PROMS) and
the Memory for Intentions Screening Test (CMIST) were compared in
samples of clinically referred children, using different types of distracter
(ongoing) tasks to determine the influence of those tasks on scores.
Participants and Methods: Participants in Study 1 were 75 children
and adolescents (mean age 9.6 years) referred for attention and learning
disorders. The CMIST was administered using a word search as the
distracter task, while the PROMS was administered using academic
testing as the distracter. Test administration was counterbalanced to
prevent order effects.

Participants in Study 2 were 22 clinically referred children and adolescents (mean age 9.2 years). For both measures on this occasion,
however, the distracter task was identical, i.e., the popular “Minecraft”
game. Again, tests were counterbalanced.
Results: In Study 1, there was a moderately strong correlation (r =
.64, p <.001) between the PROMS and the CMIST. PROMS scores
were slightly lower overall, possibly reflecting the greater demands of
academic testing as a distracter.
In Study 2, there was once again a moderately strong correlation (r =
.62, p < .01). Here, however, CMIST scores were lower, suggesting that
when the distracter task is the same, the greater cognitive demands of
the CMIST make it more difficult.
Conclusions: Although further investigation of reliability and validity
is needed with both of these measures, the fact that they are reasonably well correlated with each other indicates that one or both may
ultimately be useful as indicators of PM in both typical and clinically
referred children.

A.M. RACH, J.V. WETHE, M. HOWARD, A. STARLING &
D. DODICK. Age-Based Child-SCAT3 and SCAT3 Normative Values
Using a Youth Football Population.
Objective: Since the release of The Standardized Concussion Assessment Tool (SCAT3) and the pediatric version for children under the age
of 13 (Child-SCAT3) studies examining the normative properties of the
tools in youth 12 years of age and younger have yet to be published. The
relative paucity of baseline assessments within concussion management
protocols has increased the need for normative data. The purpose of
this study was to provide normative data for the SCAT-3/Child-SCAT3
component and domain scores in a population of youth football players.
Participants and Methods: Pre-season Child-SCAT3/SCAT3 data was
collected from 114 youth football players. Athletes with a diagnosis of
ADHD (n=6) or LD (n=3) were excluded. The 105 athletes were male,
ranged 10–13 years of age, and seven players self-reported a previous
concussion.
Results: Average composite scores on the Child-SCAT3 were 25.54 for
the SAC Total Score, 2.60 for the BESS, and 5.21 for athlete and 4.5
for parent-report on the PCSS. Average scores on the SCAT3 were 26.5
for the SAC Total Score, 5.17 for the BESS, and athletes endorsed an
average of 5.2 symptoms. One-way ANOVA revealed a main effect of
age on the SAC domains of Orientation [F (2, 80) = 3.6, p <.05], and
Delayed Recall [F (2, 80) = 6.1, p <.01], and the Total Score [F (2,
76) = 3.6, p <.05]. Younger athletes performed more poorly than older
athletes. Age was not related to BESS or symptom report.
Conclusions: Age significantly influences performance on baseline cognitive screening measures. Athletes aged 10 years or younger achieve
scores significantly lower than older peers. This age related variability
supports the importance of obtaining baseline cognitive screening scores
for post-injury comparison. Although age did not influence balance or
pre-season symptom report, given that athletes endorsed symptomatology at baseline, obtaining a baseline symptom checklist is important for
post-injury comparison before returning the athlete to play.

T.A. RENTERIA-VAZQUEZ & J. TURNBULL. Reading Skills in a 3
Year-Old Boy Diagnosed With Hyperlexia: Case Report.
Objective: This case study describes the neuropsychological, developmental, and socioemotional functioning of a 3 year-old boy (EJ) with
an obsessive interest in letters/words and superior word reading that
emerged spontaneously. Whether this characterization alone should
define the term Hyperlexia (Hyl) is a matter of debate. The common
definition emphasizes a core discrepancy between superior word reading

Forty Fourth Annual INS Meeting Abstracts
ability and weaker reading comprehension ability. However, terminological confusion ensues: Is Hyl a distinct disorder, a feature of a disorder, or on a continuum inclusive of non-clinical populations? We take
Grigorenko et al.’s, (2003) position that Hyl should be reserved for
individuals with autism spectrum disorder and apply this to EJ’s case.
Participants and Methods: EJ is a 3-year-old Caucasian boy. The child
was administered standardized neurocognitive and academic tests and
the Castelli Animation Test. Caregivers were administered normative
behavior checklists.
Results: On the WPPSI-IV, EJ displayed very superior performance
on the verbal comprehension/working memory indices, but a significantly discrepant average performance on the visual spatial index. He
displayed very superior word reading abilities (SS=158-244) and strong
but reduced reading comprehension abilities (SS=115-175). Qualitative
data, (research test) results, and parents/teacher ASD rating scales were
consistent with ASD.
Conclusions: Overall, EJ’s profile raises ambiguities and terminological
confusion, even in the context of a commonly accepted definition of Hyl.
His word reading is significantly higher than expected for his age and his
reading comprehension. Despite the large discrepancy, EJ was able to
understand much of what he read. At the same time, EJ showed a clear
bias for the explicit and concrete aspects of what he read. Such nuances
are lost within Hyl definition that rest upon neurocognitive concepts, but
are uniquely captured by a focus upon more global processes involved
in the processing of individuals with ASD.

A.D. SCHMID, K. LINNEA & J. LICHTENSTEIN. An Examination
of WAIS-IV Digit Span Sequencing in a Clinical Sample.
Objective: While WAIS-IV Digit Span Sequencing (DSS) is conceptualized as a working memory measure, the construct validity of this task
has been questioned. Clinical experience suggests that DSS performance
is more consistent with WAIS-IV Arithmetic (AR) than with Digit Span
(DSF) or Digit Span (DSB). Therefore, it was hypothesized that DSS
measures an aspect of number sense above working memory. As little
research has been conducted on this concept, this study explored the
relationship between DSS and other tasks measuring number sense and
working memory in a clinical sample.
Participants and Methods: The data of 27 male (55.6%) and female
(44.4%) adolescents, ages 16-17 years (M = 16.33, SD = .48) referred
for outpatient neuropsychological evaluation was retrospectively analyzed. Correlation and multiple regression analyses were conducted to
examine the relationship between DSS and various potential predictors.
Variables included DSF, DSB, AR, and either Trail Making Test Part A
or DKEFS Trail Making Test Condition 3 (TNS).
Results: Using WAIS-IV FSIQ as a control variable, partial correlations
revealed a significant and positive association between DSS and AR
(r=.51, p <.01). No additional significant correlations emerged. Within
multiple regression analyses, AR and TNS significantly predicted DSS
in the expected direction (B=.59, p<.05 and B =.31, p<.05). Although
DSB also emerged as a significant predictor of DSS, the association was
negative (B =-.37, p<.05).
Conclusions: These results support our clinical observations that aspects of number sense significantly contribute to DSS performance.
Unexpectedly, DSS was inversely correlated with DSB, suggesting that
they may be measuring different constructs. This has implications for
the use of the Digit Span composite score within clinical populations.
Further, these findings highlight the need for a re-examination of how
DSS is clinically interpreted.

M.E. SELEME, Y. ROMERO & L. ROJAS. Pilot Study to Assess the
Development of Executive Functions in Cuban Preschoolers Using
Two Tests Developed in Brazil.
Objective: To assess the development of the executive functions in a
sample of cuban preschoolers using the Cancellation Attention Test and
the Trail-making Test for Pre-schoolers developed in Brazil.
Participants and Methods: A total of 39 children between 5 and 6
years old, females and males, performed the tests that evaluate attention
and cognitive flexibility. The results were statistically analyzed with the
Mann-Whitney U Test for mean differences.
Results: No significant differences were found between the two age
groups, 5 vs. 6 years old, in any of the variables from the Cancellation
Attention Test and the Trail-making Test for Pre-schoolers.
Conclusions: Both 5 and 6 years old children behaved as an homogeneous group regarding the proper development of the executive functions assessed by the Cancellation Attention Test and the Trail-making
test. The results show a correspondence between the mean values of
the overall variables of both tests and the mean values of the Brazilian
norms.The Brazilian tests were useful to assess the executive functions
and cognitive flexibility in the cuban sample studied. Our study suggests

K. SKILLICORN, L.A. JACOBSON, T. ZABEL, E.F. JONES &
A.E. PRITCHARD. Psychometric Equivalence of Online and
Paper-and-Pencil Caregiver Behavior Ratings.
Objective: Benefits of online versus paper-and-pencil (P&P) data collection include increased sample size, and reduced costs and errors;
however, research has been mixed regarding the comparability of online
measures to their P&P counterparts (Buchanon, 2003; Carlbring et al.,
2007; Joinson, 1999). The study compared the psychometric properties of parent/caregiver behavior ratings completed online versus P&P,
hypothesizing psychometric equivalence.
Participants and Methods: Participants included 4,345 caregivers
of children aged 5-18 (64% male). Behavior ratings, including standardized measures such as the ADHD Rating Scale-IV (DuPaul et al.,
1994) and Colorado Learning Difficulties Questionnaire (Willcutt et
al., 2011), were collected as part of routine care in a neuropsychology
outpatient clinic. Ratings were completed either online (n=3831) or
via P&P (n=514).
Results: The two groups were similar on child age, sex, and behavior/
symptom severity, but caregiver education was significantly lower in
the P&P group (χ2=186.39, p<.001). Across administration formats,
scale inter-item reliabilities were similar and all fell within an acceptable
range (Cronbach’s αs>.70). Comparison of results of group-specific
exploratory factor analysis suggested nearly identical factor structures
for each measure across administration formats, with factor loadings
correlated very highly across groups (rc ranged from .977-.999 across
measures). The P&P group generated significantly more missing data
across measures (t(4031)=5.21, p<.001).
Conclusions: Despite differences in caregiver education across groups,
caregiver ratings of child behavior evidenced comparable psychometric
properties (i.e., inter-item reliability, scale factor structure, factor loadings) across administration formats. Online ratings may offer substantial clinical and research benefits while maintaining the psychometric
properties of the original P&P measures.

M. VASSERMAN, M. MAIMAN, M. JORGENSON, G. WITKIN &
W.S. MACALLISTER. WISC-V Profiles in Children with ADHD and
Learning Disabilities.
Objective: There are no independent studies examining WISC-V profiles of children with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder or Learning Disabilities. We aimed to evaluate sensitivity of WISC-V to presence
of cognitive impairment in this group.

102
Participants and Methods: 43 clinically referred children received
the WISC-V as part of a clinical neuropsychological evaluation. Means
and standard deviations were computed for index and subtest scores
and t-tests assessed differences between groups on WISC-V variables.
Results: Participants ranged in age from 6–15 (Mean=9.20).
Thirty-two children had ADHD, 18 had LD, 14 had co-morbid ADHD/LD. Ten children had unspecified ADHD, LD or language disorder. For the sample, the Processing Speed Index was
the weakest composite (Mean=96.95;SD=17.46), followed by
Working Memory Index (Mean=99.84;SD=16.3). The Verbal Comprehension Index (Mean=103.58;SD=12.55), Fluid Reasoning Index (Mean=104.49;SD=16.05) and Visual Spatial Index composites
(Mean=104.79;SD=15.39) were strongest. The General Ability Index,
on average, (Mean=104.42;SD=14.82) was stronger for our sample than
the Cognitive Proficiency Index (97.88; SD=16.58). On a subtest level,
Figure Weights was strongest (Mean=11.37; SD=2.94), while Coding
was weakest for the group (Mean=9.44;SD=3.68). Using scaled score of
5 or lower as threshold for impairment, Coding was the most frequently
impaired task, (11.6% of sample). Within the Digit Span subtests, Digit
Span Sequencing was most commonly impaired (11.6%), followed by
Digit Span Backwards (9.3%). No children were impaired on block
design, similarities, figure weights, or visual puzzles. There were no
group differences in any subtest or index scores between those with
ADHD and/or LD and those without.
Conclusions: In this sample of children with ADHD/LD high rates of
impairments were not seen on any of the WISC-V variables, though
groups performed better on tasks of general abilities than cognitive
proficiency.

Executive Functions/Frontal Lobes
B.A. BAILEY, C.C. FECK, M. SCITURRO & S.C. HEATON. The Role
of Executive Functioning in Youth Self-Esteem.
Objective: Self-esteem (SE) has been defined as the ratio of reality
to ideal, such that success in areas of personal importance leads to
improved SE. Low youth SE is predictive of poor outcomes such as
delinquency and aggression. Executive functioning (EF) has been implicated as a predictor of success in areas important for development
and maintenance of SE (e.g., academics & peer relations), but little is
known about the direct relationship between EF and SE. The current
study sought to explore the relationship between youth SE and EF,
with particular focus on the relative contribution of parent-report and
performance-based measures of EF.
Participants and Methods: Participants (205 youth ages 8-16 referred
for neuropsychological assessment) were administered the Behavioral
Rating Inventory of Executive Functioning (BRIEF) and the Creature
Counting task of the Test of Everyday Attention for Children (TEA-Ch)
to assess EF. SE was measured using the youth self-report version of
the Behavioral Assessment Scale for Children (BASC).
Results: Bootstrapped step-wise regression analysis revealed that the
Inhibit subscale of the BRIEF was significantly associated with SE
(R2=.03, p<.05) but accounted for little variance. After accounting for
parent-report of inhibition skills, no significant associations remained
between SE and other BRIEF scales nor performance on the Creature
Counting task.
Conclusions: Stronger SE was seen in youth with stronger behavioral
inhibition skills. This suggests a relationship between executive functioning and self-esteem, but the performance-based measure failed to
exhibit this relationship, and the variance explained by parent-reported
EF was small. Future studies are needed to confirm that this relationship
is best captured through rating scale assessment methods. It will also
be important to examine the role of EF in SE in the context of broader

youth functioning, as parent-reported EF plays only a small role in this
likely complex model.

The Role of Parent-Reported vs. Performance-Based Executive
Functioning in Youth Academic Achievement.
Objective: Research has indicated that executive functioning (EF)
broadly predicts academic achievement. Though recent research has
highlighted differences between rating scales and tests of EF, little
is known about these assessment methods as they relate to academic
achievement (AA). The current study sought to determine the association between youth AA and both performance-based and parent-report
EF measures.
Participants and Methods: EF was assessed in a mixed clinical sample
of 77 youth ages 8-18 with the Creature Counting subtest of the Test of
Everyday Attention for Children (TEA-Ch, to age 16) and parent ratings
on the Behavioral Rating Inventory of Executive Functioning (BRIEF).
AA was measured using word reading, math calculation, and spelling
tasks from the Woodcock Johnson Tests of Achievement (WJ-Ach) or
the Wechsler’s Individual Achievement Tests (WIAT).
Results: Results revealed significant correlations between Creature
Counting performance and both reading and spelling AA (r=.37 &
r=.41, p<.05). In contrast, parent-rated problems with EF (BRIEF Shift
scale) only correlated with lower reading AA (r=-.29, p≤.05).
Conclusions: Results indicate that the performance-based task is a
stronger, broader predictor of AA. Greater parent-reported attentional
control (as assessed by the Shift subscale) was associated with better
word reading. However, greater performance on the Creature Counting task (which also measures attentional control) was more strongly
associated with word reading and was associated with higher spelling performance. This study provides support for the use of performance-based measures of EF in assessments conducted for educational
recommendations. Future studies should continue to explore benefits
of performance-based and parent-report methods and their ability to
predict other academic indicators such as grades.

M. CARLIER & Y. DELEVOYE-TURRELL. Assessment of
inhibition predetermines the tolerance to physical effort.
Objective: Objective: The tolerance to effort is defined as a trait that
influences one’s ability to continue exercising at an imposed level of
intensity even when the activity becomes uncomfortable or unpleasant.
In the present study, we hypothesized that inhibition capacities will
predetermine the ability to resist to higher efforts as suggested by the
strength model of self-control (Audiffren and André, 2014). The more
efficient one’s inhibition ability, the more one should be tolerant to
physical effort and resist to the urge to stop.
Participants and Methods: Participants and methods: 45 healthy individuals participated in the study. The inhibition capacities were assessed
using the anti-saccade task (Miyake, 2000). The tolerance threshold was
assessed using the PRETIE-Q questionnaire and two groups were determined (high vs. low tolerance). Physical activity consisted in cycling
for 40 minutes, at a self-set intensity defined as “somewhat difficult”
on the Perceived Exertion Scale (RPE 13). Feelings were assessed every
5 minutes using the Feeling Scale. Power output was measured at the
same frequency on the ergo cycle (TechnoGym).
Results: Results: The low tolerance group revealed an inhibition ability
that was significantly weaker (i.e., less effective) than the high tolerance
group: they provided fewer correct answers in the anti-saccade task
especially in the incongruent condition. The low tolerance group was
also characterized by slower reaction times. During physical activity,

Forty Fourth Annual INS Meeting Abstracts
for the same level of perceived effort, the low tolerance group produced
less power output than the high tolerance group with similar levels of
affective responses.
Conclusions: Conclusion: High tolerance individuals may have the ability to resist longer to the emergence of negative feelings, which helps
them produce more physical output than low tolerance individuals.
Assessment of inhibition may be a tool to predict tolerance to physical
effort and thus, predict the emotional experience of Adapted Physical
Activity used for rehabilitation.

M. CLEM, A. HOLLAND, R. PEREZ & P. STAVINOHA. Parental
Ratings of Executive Functioning in Pediatric Survivors of
Medulloblastoma and Pilocytic Astrocytoma.
Objective: The present study compared parental ratings of executive
functioning (EF) in pediatric survivors of medulloblastoma (MB) and
pilocytic astrocytoma (PA) and examined factors contributing to those
ratings. It was hypothesized that parental ratings would reflect worse
EF in MB patients due to their history of irradiation, unlike PA patients.
Participants and Methods: 36 survivors of MB and 20 survivors of
PA completed a brief neuropsychological battery including the Wechsler
Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence. Parents completed the Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Functioning (BRIEF).
Results: Univariate tests indicated no significant group differences with
regard to socioeconomic status (SES), gender, age at testing, ethnicity,
or medical variables other than history of irradiation. However, PA
survivors were younger at diagnosis (p < .01). The PA group demonstrated significantly higher FSIQ and was rated as having significantly
more problems on BRIEF scales of Emotional Control, Initiate, Working
Memory, Plan/Organize, Organization of Materials, and Monitor (all p <
.05). Regression analyses showed that SES, FSIQ, age at diagnosis, and
medical variables did not predict parental ratings of EF.
Conclusions: Findings regarding FSIQ are consistent with known effects of irradiation. However, the hypothesis was not supported, as PA
survivors were described as having greater problems with EF. Research
has shown older age at time of diagnosis and tumor resection is associated with stronger EF for MB and PA patients. Present findings suggest
that younger age at diagnosis may be an even greater risk factor than
irradiation in terms of EF late effects for these groups, which may help
inform treatment decisions if supported by further research. Alternatively, parental ratings of EF may more prominently reflect rater bias
than actual EF. Specifically, varying parental expectations for EF based
on general level of disability (related to treatment intensity; FSIQ) may
result in biased reports of perceived EF deficits.

E. CRAUN, S. KAPLAN, C. WILLIAMS, K. WESTERHAUS &
M.M. WONG. Executive Functioning Moderates the Association
Between Parent-Child Relationship and Alcohol Use.
Objective: Alcohol use increases in emerging adulthood (i.e., 18-25
years). This may be due to the fact that emerging adults often live
outside the home, away from their parents’ supervision, allowing for
an increase in risky behavior. Closeness in a parent-child relationship
may mitigate this risky behavior. Indeed, previous research reported that
closeness of the parent-child relationship is protective against alcohol
use (Petraitis et al., 1995). A risk factor for alcohol use is executive
functioning (EF) ability (Wong et al., 2010), where deficits in the flexibility of behavior, inhibition of responses, and planning for the future
is associated with increased alcohol use. The purpose of this study is to
assess how EF ability moderates the relationship between parent-child
closeness (PCC) and alcohol use in a population of emerging adults.
Participants and Methods: This study examined 239 college students
between the ages of 18 to 25. Participants completed the Parent-Child
Closeness scale, Rutgers Alcohol Problems Inventory, and the Tower

103
of Hanoi. A regression model was employed to evaluate the association
between PCC and alcohol use, moderated by EF ability.
Results: Tower scores significantly moderated the relationship between
PCC scores and number of alcohol problems (ΔR2=.02, F(1, 201)=
5.39, p< .05). Additionally, Tower scores also significantly predicted
a decrease in alcohol problems (b=-1.74, t=-2.82, p<.05). Subsequent
probing of the interaction showed that among individuals with low
(b=-2.09, t=-3.83, p<.005) to average EF (b=-1.19, t=-2.92, p<.005),
PCC was negatively related to alcohol problems, such that participants
who were close to their parents had fewer alcohol problems. Among individuals with high EF, PCC had no relationship with alcohol problems.
Conclusions: These results suggest that high EF abilities are a robust
protective factor against alcohol use. For those with low to average EF
abilities, parent-child relationship may act as a protective factor to
drinking problems.

K. CROCFER & J. REESMAN. Parent Ratings of Executive Function
in Children with a History of Hearing Loss.
Objective: Multiple studies have examined the clinical utility of the Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Functioning- Parent form (BRIEF)
in various clinical populations. The present study sought to examine the
impact of the presence of hearing loss on parent ratings on the BRIEF
in clinically referred samples of children with and without hearing loss.
Participants and Methods: Parent ratings were examined in groups
of children with and without a history of hearing loss. Our hearing loss
sample included 34 children (61.8% male) ages 8-14. Twenty-nine of
the children reported past use of auditory supports (e.g. hearing aids,
cochlear implant) with twenty-seven of the children presently using auditory supports. The majority (n=29) were diagnosed with hearing loss
prior to age two years. An age and gender matched sample of children
without hearing loss was used for comparison (n=34). Parent ratings on
the BRIEF were examined for each group individually and comparisons
between groups were examined via independent samples t-tests.
Results: Examination of scores on the BRIEF for both groups demonstrated an average group rating above the mean. Significant differences
between the groups were noted only on the Monitor scale of the BRIEF
demonstrating that children in the sample with hearing loss were actually rated closer to the average range (M=55.91; SD=12.49) than
children without hearing loss (M=62.35; SD=12.21); t (66)= -2.15,
p= .035.
Conclusions: Present results suggest that parents of children with or
without hearing loss tend to rate their children similarly when presenting
for clinical evaluation. Presence of hearing loss within the context of
additional concerns of neurocognitive impact that prompt referral for
neuropsychological evaluation may not contraindicate use of parent
rating scales designed for parents of children with typical hearing status.
Additional study of parent ratings and relationship to child’s performance on performance based measures is still necessary, particularly
for children with hearing loss.

Between Depression and Externalizing Behavior in Children and
Adolescents.
Objective: Children and adolescents with depression are at increased
risk for externalizing problems, such as aggression and delinquency.
However, the mechanisms underlying this comorbidity remain poorly
understood. This study examines executive dysfunction as a potential
moderator of the relationship between depressive symptoms and externalizing behaviors in youth.

104
Participants and Methods: 170 participants aged 8-17 were recruited
as part of an ongoing investigation of youth presenting for psychological
assessment at a general hospital. Parents rated executive dysfunction on
the Behavior Rating of Executive Function (BRIEF) and externalizing
problems on the Behavior Assessment System for Children (BASC-2).
Youth rated their own depressive symptoms on the self-report BASC-2.
Results: In a hierarchical regression model, youth externalizing problems were predicted by the interaction between depressive symptoms
and executive dysfunction. The association between depressive symptoms and increased externalizing problems was strongest for youth with
greater executive dysfunction.
Conclusions: Results suggest that depressed youth with executive dysfunction may be at particular risk for externalizing problems. This study
highlights executive dysfunction as a risk factor for future investigation,
as well as a potential target for intervention among depressed youth.

Extending the “cross-disorder” relevance of executive functions
to dimensional neuropsychiatric traits in youth.
Objective: Executive functions (EFs) are promising mediators of the
underlying genetic risk that is now known to be shared across different neuropsychiatric conditions; yet, evidence that the same cognitive
functions are impaired across different forms of psychopathology comes
primarily from separate studies of individual categorical diagnoses versus controls. Given growing support for dimensional models that cut
across traditional diagnostic boundaries, we aimed to determine, within
a single cohort, whether performance on measures of EFs predicted
variation in symptoms of different psychopathological conditions known
to share genetic liability.
Participants and Methods: Data include 393 youth, ages 8 to 17,
enrolled in the Longitudinal Study of Genetic Influences on Cognition
(LOGIC). This project ascertains DNA and dimensional cognitive and
psychiatric phenotypes on consecutive referrals to a pediatric assessment
clinic within the Psychiatry Department at Mass General . First, we used
MPlus to model three cognitive factors (working memory, shifting, and
executive processing speed) that loaded on a second-order EF factor.
Then,we related this EF factor to variation in symptom dimensions of
autism, mania and psychosis.
Results: The EF factor predicted variation in our three target traits
but not in a negative control (somatization). Moreover, this EF factor
was primarily associated with the overlapping (rather than unique)
variance across the three outcome measures, suggesting it related to a
general increase in psychopathology symptoms across those dimensions.
Conclusions: Findings extend support for the relevance of EFs to neuropsychiatric conditions that share underlying genetic risk.They suggest
that EFs relate to the dimensional spectrum of these disorders and
not just the clinical diagnoses. Moreover, results have implications for
bottom-up models linking genes, cognition, and a general psychopathology liability.

Working Memory Load Negatively Impacts Moral Acceptability
Judgments.
Objective: Working memory plays a prominent role in dual process
theories of decision-making (Evans & Stanovich, 2013).These theories examine the role of effortful, controlled processes and automatic,

intuitive processes in decision-making. However, the moral reasoning
literature has emphasized higher order concepts, such as agency, utilitarian distinction, etc, with less research conducted on basic processes
such as working memory.
Participants and Methods: Participants (N = 102) were presented
with vignettes describing unpleasant moral decisions, with outcomes
early in passages to minimize working memory demands. Participants
rated how appropriate they found the vignette outcome. Outcomes were
categorized as positive, neutral or negative valence. It was hypothesized
that under greater working memory load participants would be less
successful in overcoming automatic reactions or coming to counter-intuitive conclusions.
Results: A significant main effect was observed with positive vignettes
rated most acceptable, negative vignettes least acceptable, and neutral vignettes falling in-between. A significant interaction effect was
also found between vignette valence and working memory load. Those
in working memory load conditions rated vignette acceptability less
positively than those in non-working memory load conditions. This
difference was greatest when participants were presented with vignettes
with incongruent outcomes such as a positive vignette in which participants are presented with an unpleasant moral situation (i.e. – cannibalism) that results in a positive outcome (i.e. – refusing to engage in
cannibalism).
Conclusions: The interaction effect observed in this study supports
findings that working memory plays an important role in moral decision
making. Notably, it illustrates working memory was necessary in overcoming automatic responses and forming counter-intuitive conclusions.
Furthermore, dual process theories are applicable in moral reasoning
research and shed light on the underlying cognitive processes.

E.I. FRANCHOW, M. NIERMEYER, J. BALL & Y. SUCHY. Expressive
Suppression in Older Adulthood Differentially Depletes Executive
Functioning.
Objective: Higher-than-usual burden of regulation of affective responses
known as expressive suppression (ES) is associated with acutely-compromised executive functioning (known as “executive depletion”), but
not working memory or processing speed, in young adults (Franchow
& Suchy, 2015). We have also demonstrated this executive depletion
effect in a pilot sample of older adults (Franchow, Rhodewalt, Rigby,
& Suchy, 2014). However, it is unclear whether the depletion effect
remains specific to executive functioning in older adulthood.
Participants and Methods: 98 adults (M=69 years old; 66.3% female;
M=15.75 years of education) completed four subtests from the Delis
Kaplan Executive Functioning System, with scores reflecting response
generation, maintenance, and switching (Exec-Pre) and processing
speed (PS-Pre) combined into composite scores. Participants were then
pseudo-randomly assigned to undergo experimental manipulation of
ES (viewing 5 minutes of disgusting and amusing videos) under one
of two conditions: 1) Suppress (maintaining neutral affect), or 2) Free
Expression (responding naturally). Participants then repeated cognitive
testing (Exec-Post, PS-Post). Groups were comparable in age, sex, and
years of education.
Results: Repeated measures analysis of variance with executive and processing speed composites as dependent variables, time (Pre v. Post) as
the within-subjects factor, experimental condition as the between-subjects factor, and age and sex as covariates showed a main effect of time
(F(1, 91)= 4.063, p= .047) and an interaction between time, condition,
and domain (F(1, 91)= 6.039, p= .016); both groups showed a significant practice effect on processing speed, but only Free Expression
Participants also showed a significant practice effect on executive scores.
Conclusions: These results suggest that the depleting effect of ES continues to be specific to executive functioning in older adulthood, as it
is in younger adulthood.

A.B. WATERS & A. MACKAY-BRANDT. D-KEFS Normative Data
from the Nathan Kline Institute – Rockland Sample (NKI-RS)
Open-Access Data Resource.
Objective: Despite an era of great enthusiasm for brain science and the
growth of fields that examine brain – behavioral relationships, there
is a wide gap in the ability to map brain structure and function to
associated variations in behavior as measured by cognitive, health, or
psychodiagnostic assessment. In order to close this gap, we need largescale normative data with extensive characterization across modalities.
Participants and Methods: The Nathan Kline Institute-Rockland
Sample (NKI-RS) is a large-scale, cross-sectional sample of brain
development (aged 6 – 85 years), with the aim to characterize 1000
community-ascertained participants using multimodal neuroimaging,
genetics, health and extensive behavioral assessments. Participants were
recruited from the Rockland County, NY area. Normative data on 620
participants (aged 8-85 years) who were administered the D-KEFS
are described in detail and in comparison to the published D-KEFS
standardization sample.
Results: Differences in inclusion criteria are reviewed, with the NKI-RS
including higher levels of psychiatric symptoms and substance use. The
NKI-RS D-KEFS normative data is presented in the same age group format as the standardization tables and includes additional stratification
by education levels above 16 years. Correlations among D-KEFS task
performance and measures of mood and substance use are described by
age grouping. Further, the authors are creating a computerized look-up
tool for the NKI-RS D-KEFS data as a normative resource and aim to
solicit feedback on its utility.
Conclusions: The NKI-RS provides researchers with open-access,
pre-publication data for the testing of existing hypotheses and the generation of novel hypotheses through the application of data exploration
techniques. All datasets are shared through the web-based Collaborative Neuroinformatics Neuroimaging Suite of the Mind Research Network. Genetic samples are available through the NIMH Genetics Repository. [NIMH BRAINS R01MH094639-01 NIMH R01MH0812118

B. GORTER, Y. OH, E. HELDER & M. GUNNOE. The relationship
between cognitive inhibition and disinhibited social behaviors in
internationally adopted children.
Objective: Internationally adopted children are at an increased risk for
developing disinhibited social behaviors (also known as indiscriminate
friendliness), (Love, 2015) which is positively correlated with length
of early deprivation (Bruce, 2009; Rutter, 2007). Some researchers
have found that this relationship is mediated by poor inhibitory control
(Bruce, 2009), while others have failed to find this mediating effect
(Colvert et al., 2008). We seek to clarify this relationship by measuring
inhibitory control at several time-points in a longitudinal design. In
addition post-adoption parenting factors will be examined as predictors
of disinhibited social behavior.
Participants and Methods: Forty nine (16 male, 33 female) internationally adopted were tested at four different time points in a longitudinal design. The mean age of adoption=57 months (SD=47.45); average
time spent in adoptive home at year 1=20.9 months (SD =18.94). Neuropsychological assessments of attention and executive functioning were
administered in each wave as were parent ratings of disinhibited social
behaviors, child behavior, emotional development, executive functioning, and parenting. Child ratings of attachment and peer relationships
were collected in the fourth wave.

105
Results: Our findings suggest that greater early deprivation predicted
greater disinhibited social behavior with poor inhibitory control tending to mediate this relationship. In addition, post-adoptive parenting
discipline practices predicted disinhibited social behaviors over time.
Quality of attachment and quality of peer social relationships were not
associated with disinhibited social behavior.
Conclusions: Uncovering the variables underlying disinhibited social
behaviors could aid the development of effective interventions. Also,
post-parent discipline practices could be used to mitigate the effects of
early deprivation on disinhibited social behaviors.

K. HERNANDEZ, G. ALARCÓN, H. STEIN & B. NAGEL. Increased
Anxiety Predicts Superior Set-Shifting Performance in Healthy
Adolescents.
Objective: Clinical levels of anxiety have been associated with deficits
in attention, inhibition, and set-shifting. Set-shifting allows for cognitive flexibility, a skill helpful in coping with distress. The relationship
between anxiety and set-shifting has not been investigated during adolescence, a period of development during which maturation of the brain
and executive functions is occurring, and base-rates of anxiety increase.
Participants and Methods: Thus, this study investigated the relationship between subclinical anxiety symptoms and set-shifting performance in a sample of 144 healthy adolescents, aged 12-15 years
(M=13.54, SD= 0.869). Participants completed the National Institute
of Mental Health Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Children, Predictive
Scale interview (DPS), the Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory
(STAI), and the Delis-Kaplan Executive Function System (D-KEFS)
Color-Word Interference task. A composite score for anxiety was created
by adding normalized DPS Generalized Anxiety Disorder scores and
STAI State Anxiety scores. Set-shifting was investigated by computing
a score that incorporated the Inhibition/Switching reaction time and
errors, while controlling for inhibition.
Results: Multiple regression, controlling for age and sex, revealed that
anxiety scores were positively associated with performance on the Inhibition/Switching task, F(1, 142)= 3.99, p<.05. Relationships between
anxiety scores and the Color Naming, Word Reading, and Inhibition
components of the task were not significant (all p’s>.05), suggesting
that this effect was specific to set-shifting.
Conclusions: Along with deficits seen in clinical populations, these
findings may support the notion of an inverted U-shaped relationship
between arousal and executive functioning, and that a moderate amount
of subclinical anxiety may lead to better set-shifting performance.

B.D. HOLCOMBE, A.M. CROOKS, A.L. COTTON, D.L. RAINEY
& H.M. HILL. Exploring Relationships in Executive Functioning
Based on Neurocognitive Performance, Parent Ratings, and Social
Support.
Objective: Previous studies have pointed to a positive relationship between parental involvement/social support and executive functioning
(EF) outcomes in young children. Specifically, strong parental attachment and security was linked to improvements over time in cognitive
flexibility and inhibitory control. The first objective of the present study
is to examine relationships between performance-based and parent ratings of EF. The second objective is to explore the predictive nature of
social support on performance-based EF outcomes.
Participants and Methods: Pilot data from 17 participants (77% female, evaluation age M = 9.41, SD = .618) was collected from a sample
of urban elementary school students. Participants were excluded if they
met diagnostic criteria for Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). This study

106
used EF data collected during a brief neurocognitive evaluation and
social support ratings from a child resiliency/social support instrument.
Results: While associations between domain-matched variables were
not found for inhibitory control after controlling for age and gender,
a moderately significant relationship was found for working memory
(r(6) = .61, p = .06). Based on parent ratings, significant associations
were also found between inhibitory control and attention (r(6) = .81, p
< .01), inhibitory control and working memory (r(6) = .712, p < .05),
and attention and working memory (r(6) = .828, p < .01). Analysis of
social support and EF was not significant.
Conclusions: Previous associations between social support and patterns
of EF performance were not replicated in this study; however, findings
should be interpreted with caution due to sample size. Overall, significant relationships between EF domains were found based on parent
report, with relationships between IC and AT, IC and WM, and WM
and AT being noted.

A.K. HOLLAND, A. ROSA, C. BLANCO, M. DOSTER &
D.W. HARRISON. The Association Between Exposure to a
Traumatic Event and Compromised Functional Cerebral Systems
in the Left and Right Frontal Lobes.
Objective: Functional cerebral systems mediated by the right and left
frontal lobes may be diminished with the experience of a traumatic event
(i.e.: sexual assault, death of a family member, or car accident). For the
current research, it is hypothesized that the functional cerebral systems
mediated by the left and right frontal lobes are compromised in those
who have been exposed to a significant traumatic event.
Participants and Methods: College undergraduates who have reported
(n=24) and have not reported (n=56) being exposed to a traumatic event
completed the Controlled Oral Word Association Task (COWAT) and
the Ruff Figural Fluency Task (RFFT). Heart Rate (HR) measures were
taken before and after completion of these tasks.
Results: A Trauma x Trial interaction for the Number of Unique Words
Produced (F(2, 156)=3.17, p=.04) was found, indicating that individuals reporting having been exposed to a traumatic event evidenced a
reduction in unique words produced compared to those reporting no
exposure. This interaction was not present when completing the RFFT.
A nonsignificant trend for HR (F(1, 53)=2.93, p=.09) was found, indicating that those individuals exposed to a traumatic event evidenced
an increase in HR upon completion of the COWAT.
Conclusions: The current research provides preliminary evidence that
exposure to a traumatic event may provide reductions in functional
cerebral systems responsible for phonemic fluency production and
cardiovascular regulation. The capacity to produce fluent speech and
maintain stable levels of frontal lobe activation may be compromised
in individuals exposed to a traumatic event.

The Relationship between Level of Executive Functioning and
Engagement in High-Risk Behavior among Urban Homeless
Youth.
Objective: Many youths experiencing homelessness are exposed to
challenges that impact their neurocognitive development, contributing
to poor decision making and higher risk taking behavior. This study
examined the relationship between level of executive functioning (EF)
and engagement in risky behaviors including alcohol, marijuana, and
high-risk sex, among a shelter-living sample of urban homeless youth.
Participants and Methods: 148 youths were recruited from homeless
agencies in Chicago and Los Angeles (53% female; 76% African-American; ages 18-22). EF was assessed using summary scores from the

BRIEF, including the Behavioral Regulation Index (BRI), Metacognition
Index (MI), and Global Executive Composite (GEC). Youths were divided based on EF scores, with youths scoring at least one standard deviation above the normed average on the BRIEF classified as showing high
EF, and low EF defined as those scoring at least one standard deviation
below the normed average. Risk behaviors were measured using items
from an amended version of the National Youth Risk Behavior Survey
(YRBS) and the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI).
Results: Analyses revealed that homeless youths who fell into the low
EF group were significantly more likely to have engaged in risky levels
of alcohol and marijuana use, and unprotected sex, than those in the
high EF group. Youth meeting criteria for a substance abuse diagnosis
were also shown to have earlier ages of use, highlighting increased risk
secondary to homelessness history.
Conclusions: Results suggest a strong link between poor EF and engaging in risky behaviors. Better understanding of connections between
level of EF and risk behaviors is an important step toward possible
treatment and intervention for at risk youth. Results are discussed in
terms of approaches to supporting better EF in these youths.

K. KLIPFEL, E. BAKER, J. GUNSTAD, J. DUNLOSKY, C. WAS
& M. VAN DULMEN. The Relative Contribution of Executive
Dysfunction to Psychological, Physical, & Sexual Dating
Aggression.
Objective: Preliminary research has shown associations between executive dysfunction and dating aggression, though the relative contribution
of executive dysfunction to subtypes of aggression is unexamined. The
current study comparatively examined the magnitude of the association
of indicators of executive dysfunction with psychological, physical, and
sexual aggression.
Participants and Methods: Members of heterosexual dating couples
(N=138; 18-29 years of-age) completed tasks of executive dysfunction, including a clinically-normed indicator (perseverative errors of the
WCST; Heaton & PAR staff, 2003) and indicators of shifting (Plus-Minus Task; Jersild, 1927), updating (Letter Memory Task; Morris &
Jones, 1990), and inhibition (Go/No-Go Task) difficulties. Psychological, physical, and sexual aggression perpetration were assessed via the
Conflict in Adolescent Dating Relationships Inventory (Wolfe et al.,
2001). Estimated intelligence (Spot-the-Word; Baddeley & Crawford,
2012) and relationship satisfaction (Relationship Assessment Scale;
Hendrick et al., 1998) served as controls.
Results: Within structural equation models, pairwise equality constraints revealed that female updating difficulties differed in magnitude
of association with psychological (β=-.02, p=.77) and physical (β=.13,
p=.23) dating aggression [Δχ2(1)=3.77, p=.05; ΔCFI=-.05]. Female
inhibition difficulties differed in magnitude of association with physical
(β=-.17, p=.04) and sexual (β=.01, p=.90) aggression [Δχ2(1)=5.23,
p=.02; ΔCFI=-.06]. Male shifting difficulties differed in magnitude of
association between physical (β=-.08, p=.32) and sexual (β=.16, p=.05)
aggression [Δχ2(1)=10.36, p=.001; ΔCFI=-.04], as well as psychological (β=-.02, p=.84) and sexual (β=.16, p=.05) aggression [Δχ2(1)=4.77,
p=.03; ΔCFI=.00].
Conclusions: Generally, executive dysfunction contributes more
strongly to physical aggression for females and sexual aggression for
males, though indicator of executive dysfunction impacted findings.

A. LETTERI & L. PICK. Effortful Control Skills in Deaf Children
with and without Additional Disabilities.
Objective: Research with deaf children often fails to discriminate between children who are deaf and children who are deaf with additional disabilities. When examining concepts such as effortful control

Forty Fourth Annual INS Meeting Abstracts
(attention focusing, attention shifting, inhibitory control, and impulsivity) this distinction can be clinically and academically significant. Effortful control has a global impact on developmental processes including
language, memory, and affective regulation. Hearing loss, through its
impact on language acquisition, is known to affect a child’s ability to
develop effortful control skills. When providing care to deaf children it
is also important to consider the impact of atypical neurodevelopmental
burdens above and beyond hearing loss. This research aims to better
understand these potential differences in the development of effortful
control skills within a heterogeneous group of deaf children.
Participants and Methods: Sixty-nine parents of deaf children between the ages of 6-10 years (mean age = 8.69, SD = 251.49 months)
were recruited. Forty children were reported as deaf and 29 children
were reported as being deaf with additional disabilities. Parents completed online surveys including a demographic questionnaire and the
Effortful Control Scale of the Child Behavior Questionnaire.
Results: Deaf children were rated as demonstrating significantly stronger attention focusing, attention shifting, and inhibitory control skills
when compared to their peers with additional disabilities. Both groups
were rated similarly on impulsivity.
Conclusions: This research suggests that the presence of additional
disabilities is associated with weaker development of regulatory capabilities above and beyond what is typically expected for hearing loss
alone. When children who are deaf are seen by clinical providers, it is
important to distinguish between those who are deaf and those who are
deaf with additional disabilities.

T. MOBERGET, J. STUBBERUD & A. SOLBAKK. The utility of
the Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function across
neurological and neuropsychiatric conditions - associations with
cognition and emotional distress.
Objective: The present study explored how self-reported executive functioning in daily living is related to neuropsychological test performance
and self-reported emotional distress in a large sample comprising both
healthy adults and patient populations with neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders.
Participants and Methods: Results from the self- and informant reported Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function - Adult version
(BRIEF-A) are presented, along with scores on standardized tests of executive functioning, and self-reported psychological status in Norwegian
healthy controls (n = 118), patients with severe traumatic brain injury
(n = 127), focal frontal lobe damage (n = 31), focal cerebellar lesions
(n = 25), Parkinsons disease (n = 43), Attention Deficit Hyperactivity
Disorder (n=35), type II Bipolar Disorder (n = 21), and Borderline
Personality Disorder (n = 20).
Results: No or weak relationships between BRIEF-A and IQ, and tests
of executive function were found. Strong relationships were observed
between BRIEF-A and emotional distress in controls and neurological
patient groups. Scores at or above recommended clinical cut-offs where
found in the neuropsychiatric, but not in neurological patients. Controls
tended to have BRIEF-A scale and index scores 1/2-3/4 SD below the
US normative mean of T=50.
Conclusions: The study demonstrates the need to regard BRIEF-A
results within a broad differential diagnostic context, where measures
of psychological distress are included in addition to neuropsychological
tests. Uncertainty about the normative data in non-US countries adds to
the need for interpretive caution. More empirical knowledge about the
BRIEF-A, including cultural response variations, is needed.

V.W. MARK, B. LAI & A. NAIDU. Anti-saccade Testing May Reflect
Impaired Sustained Attention of Acute Rehabilitation Inpatients.
Objective: To test the responses of acute rehabilitation inpatients to
anti-saccade testing relative to age-matched control subjects.
Participants and Methods: To assess executive control using a simple
test, a convenience sample of 35 adult inpatients of diverse disorders
(mean age of 55 ± 17 years) and 26 neurologically healthy control
subjects (mean age of 60 ± 15) were recruited from an acute inpatient
rehabilitation facility. All participants performed the anti-saccades test
from the NIH Examiner test battery from a laptop computer. During
the task participants must look away from a suddenly appearing dot
whose lateralized location is unpredictable. After a brief practice trial,
participants were given 2 series of 20 anti-saccade trials each, with
about a 1-minute rest period between series. Testing was preceded by
10 trials of prosaccade testing (looking at the dot). Saccades were scored
as correct or incorrect by direct examiner evaluation. The amount of
errors made on each task was recorded. The mean errors made on each
anti-saccades trial and the overall errors made were compared between
groups by Student’s t-test.
Results: There were no significant differences in mean age and years
of education between groups (all p’s >0.05). There were no significant
differences on the mean errors made between patients (4.49 ± 3.95,
CI= 3.17-5.80) and controls (3.14 ± 2.30, CI= 2.12-4.15) on the first
anti-saccades trial (p=0.14). However, patients made a statistically
larger amount of errors (5.35 ± 4.74, CI= 4.03-6.67) on the second
anti-saccades task compared to those of the control group (2.27 ± 2.21,
CI= 0.56- 4.00; p= 0.006).
Conclusions: The anti-saccades test may provide a novel way to evaluate sustained attention in acutely disabled adults, and can be given to
individuals who lack manual dexterity or ability to vocalize. Therefore,
the anti-saccades test may increase the range of patients who can be
evaluated on sustained attention in the acute rehabilitation inpatient
setting.

K. MULHAUSER, R. VAN PATTEN, C. WHITE, K. WENZEL,
Z. MERZ & J. WEINSTOCK. Differential Relationships Among
Speeded Neuropsychological Test Performance and Facets of
Impulsivity in Individuals with Substance Use Disorder.
Objective: Impulsivity is elevated in individuals with substance use
disorder (SUD) as are inefficiencies in information processing and executive functions (EFs). We hypothesized that (a) trait-based measures
of impulsivity would remain stable across a ten-day period of initial
abstinence and (b) neuropsychological performance on speeded tests
of EFs would be negatively related to impulsivity.
Participants and Methods: Twenty-seven participants with SUD completed Trails A and B, the Victoria Stroop Task, and phonemic fluency,
as well as the UPPS-P, a self-report inventory measuring five facets of
impulsivity. Data were collected upon entry to a hospital-based residential treatment program and then again ten days later. Hypothesis one
was examined using dependent t-tests and hypothesis two was examined
using Pearson’s correlation coefficients.
Results: Partially consistent with the first hypothesis, impulsivity remained stable over time with the exception of one facet of impulsivity,
(lack of) premeditation, which significantly decreased from T1 to T2.
Hypothesis two was also partially supported, such that (lack of) premeditation exhibited a strong positive relationship with test performance at
both time points, while positive and negative urgency each demonstrated
strong negative relationships to test performance at T2 only.
Conclusions: These findings are interpreted to suggest that residential
treatment for SUD may foster self-reflection and planning abilities that
protect against a primary facet of impulsivity. Additionally, (lack of)
premeditation may enhance speeded cognitive performance, while positive and negative urgency attenuate such performance. It is noteworthy

108
that no differential relationships were present across lower-level (e.g.,
Trails A) compared to higher-level (e.g., Trails B) tasks, suggesting that
all tests were measuring a similar, speed-based construct. These findings
argue for a more fine-grained conceptualization of impulsivity and its
relationship to neuropsychological test performance in SUD.

M. NIERMEYER, E.I. FRANCHOW & Y. SUCHY. Motor Sequence
Learning in Older Adulthood: Effects of Complexity and
Relationships with Executive Functioning.
Objective: Older adults’ motor sequencing (MS) performance is more
susceptible to complexity and more reliant on executive functioning
(EF) than that of younger adults (Seidler, 2010). This study examined
whether these relationships hold for all, or only some, aspects of MS
performance, including motor-planning (MP), motor-learning (ML),
and motor-control speed and accuracy (MC-Speed; MC-Accuracy).
Participants and Methods: 58 young (18 to 37 years) and 87 older
(60 to 86 years) healthy adults completed a computerized MS task
(Push Turn Taptap task; PTT) designed to assess MP, ML, and MC
Speed and Accuracy across 4 blocks of increasing MS complexity, and
selected subtests from the Delis-Kaplan Executive Function System as
indices of EF and processing speed (PS).
Results: All aspects of the older adults’ (as compared to younger adults’)
performance were more negatively affected by complexity (all p values
< .01). Hierarchical regressions using each aspect of performance as
the dependent variable revealed for MP that EF accounted for variance
beyond PS for both age groups. In contrast, for ML and MC-Accuracy,
EF was an independent predictor for the older adults only; and for
MC-speed, EF was an independent predictor for the young adults only
(all p values <.045), Follow-up generalized linear models for each age
group reveled a trend towards an EF by complexity interaction for ML
(p = .08), such that EF accounted for unique variance for only the
moderately complex sequences.
Conclusions: These results provide additional evidence that older
adults’ motor sequencing is disproportionally affected by complexity.
Additionally, the results suggest MP is reliant on EF across the lifespan,
but ML and MC-Accuracy become reliant on EF only with increasing
age. MC-speed is related to EF only for younger adults. Collectively these
results indicate age, task complexity, and the specific aspect of MS performance all play a different role in the relationship between EF and MS.

Is Executive Functioning Related to Resilience in Humanitarian
Aid Workers?
Objective: Neurobiological changes due to chronic stress have serious
functional implications for executive functioning and memory. Research
has focused on the construct of resilience in an attempt to reverse the
long-term sequelae of chronic stress, which is particularly important
for humanitarian aid workers as they often work in increasingly violent
conflict areas. The goal of this study was to investigate associations
between executive functioning and resilience in aid workers.
Participants and Methods: Thirty-three aid workers (9 women & 24
men) between the ages of 19 and 60 (M = 39.4, SD = 10.7) from 14
countries of origin who had been deployed to global areas of need over
an average of 10.5 years (SD = 7.6) completed the California Verbal
Learning Test-II (CVLT-II) during a training workshop. They also filled
out questionnaires that included the Headington Institute Resilience
Inventory (HIRI), the Stress Vulnerability Scale (SVS), and the PTSD
Checklist (PCL-C), as well as the Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Functioning (BRIEF-A).

Results: BRIEF-A indexes correlated with 6 of 7 HIRI factors of resilience (ps between .001 and .03) and with PTSD symptoms of Hyperarousal (p = .006) and Avoidance (p = .03). The CVLT-II semantic
clustering index correlated with the SVS (r = -.44, p = .02) as did the
recall discriminability index (r = -.47, p = .01).
Conclusions: These findings suggest that executive functioning plays
a role in resilience, which raises the intriguing possibility of bolstering
stress resilience though the scaffolding of executive functioning. Thus
future studies should investigate the value of helping aid workers stay
organized, routinized, and structured in otherwise chaotic environments
as a means of providing resilience to stress and protection from poor
mental health outcomes.

Y. OH, B. GORTER, E. HELDER & M. GUNNOE. Longitudinal
investigation of memory and executive functioning in
internationally adopted children.
Objective: Previous studies have documented the negative effects of
early deprivation on cognitive domains, such as memory and executive
functioning (Bos, 2009; Pollak, 2010). However, most existing research
has been cross-sectional and has not examined post-adoptive parenting
as a predictor of cognitive outcomes. This longitudinal study investigates
memory and executive functioning in a multinational group of international adoptees and explores potential predictors.
Participants and Methods: Forty-nine children (age at study onset M
= 78.0, SD = 46.5) from ten countries were enrolled in the study (age at
adoption M = 57.0, SD = 47.7, time post-adoption at year 1 M = 21.0
months, SD = 18.9). The assessments, completed at 4 waves, consisted
of a neuropsychological battery, semi-structured parent interview, and
structured parent ratings.
Results: Deficits relative to normative samples were found for visual
and verbal memory for the first two waves. However, in waves 3 and 4,
their performance showed significant improvement. For the domain of
executive functioning, including working memory and attention, participants’ performance showed deficits for all four waves. Analyses of
predictors of outcomes indicated a parental approach involving more
consistent discipline and a more equitable balance between mothers’
and fathers’ contribution to child care predicted better cognitive performances in some domains.
Conclusions: Catch-up in certain cognitive domains in post-institutionalized children is evident, though executive functioning demonstrates
less catch-up than memory. Findings have implications for parenting
approach following international adoption.

H. OKABE, M. ESTERMAN & J. DEGUTIS. Sex differences in
sustained attention and inhibitory control across the lifespan.
Objective: Though clear sex differences have been found in verbal
(females show verbal memory advantage) and spatial abilities (males
show mental rotation advantage), less is known about sex differences
in attention and executive function and if these potential differences
change over the lifespan. To address these questions, we examined sex
differences in sustained attention and inhibitory control ability and
strategy using a go/no-go continuous performance task (CPT).
Participants and Methods: 10,430 volunteers aged 10-70 visited
TestMyBrain.org, a cognitive testing website, and performed the gradual-onset CPT (gradCPT), a go/no-go sustained attention task requiring
a response to non-targets (90%) and withholding to rare target images
(10%). Measures of interest included commission error rate (sustained
attention/inhibitory control ability), mean reaction time (speed/response strategy), and post-commission error slowing (making error-related response setting adjustments).

Forty Fourth Annual INS Meeting Abstracts
Results: Across the lifespan, compared to males, females showed a
similar commission error rate but demonstrated significantly slower
reaction times (p < 0.001; females: M = 878ms; males: M = 866ms) and
significantly more post-error slowing (p < 0.001; females: M = 78ms;
males: M = 56ms). One notable exception to the equivalent commission error rates across the lifespan is that 10-12 year old boys made
significantly more commission errors than same-aged girls (p < 0.001;
females: M = 0.40; males: M = 0.49).
Conclusions: We find that while males and females have comparable
overall inhibitory control/sustained attention abilities, females take a
more conservative response strategy and are more likely to make response setting adjustments after errors. Interestingly, amongst only the
youngest participants (10-12 year-olds), boys exhibited poorer inhibitory control/sustained attention than girls, which may reflect prefrontal
developmental sex differences and has implications for models of ADHD.

The Executive Function–Dysexecutive Behavior Connection:
Perspectives on the Contributions of Other Neuropsychological
Domains.
Objective: There is growing evidence that classic laboratory performance-based measures of executive function and report-based measures
regarding affective, behavioral, and cognitive functioning in daily life
(i.e., dysexecutive behavior) of individuals in their natural environments
tap into two distinct, and surprisingly modestly related, constructs. We
hypothesized that language and executive function are associated, and
both bear distinct associations to dysexecutive behavior.
Participants and Methods: This study examined data from 243 National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke participants with
various forms of neurodegeneration. Structural equation modeling analyses were applied to measures used to represent constructs of executive
function, dysexecutive behavior, and language. These included selected
subtests from the Delis-Kaplan Executive Function System, clinical subscales from the Frontal Systems Behavior Scale, the Boston Naming
Test, and the Token Test.
Results: The results of exploratory factor analysis confirmed a
three-factor solution. Progression of our confirmatory factor analyses
from measurement to structural models also demonstrated validity of
hypothesized relationships between constructs. There was a strong association between executive function and language constructs (r = 0.72,
p < 0.01), and between the two, only executive function significantly
contributed to dysexecutive behavior (β = -0.42, p < 0.05).
Conclusions: Executive functioning, dysexecutive behavior, and language are all important constructs in understanding the cognitive and
behavioral symptoms of neurodegenerative populations. We provide
evidence that language is related to executive function, and that the two
have distinct relationships to dysexecutive behavior. Between executive
function and language, the former exerts a more meaningful influence
on dysexecutive behavior.

B. REYNOLDS, M.R. BASSO, A.K. MILLER, D.R. COMBS,
D. WHITESIDE & L. LAU. Behavioral Correlates of the WCST in
a Neurologically Normal Sample: Perseveration Corresponds with
Risky Acts.
Objective: Executive function measures are presumed to reflect propensity to engage in risky behaviors, but relatively few studies have tested
this assumption. Research involving healthy individuals has demonstrated that the Iowa Gambling Test, a measure sensitive to orbital
frontal lobe dysfunction, corresponds with binge drinking among college
students (Xiao et al., 2009). Arguably, a more robust literature reveals
that self-report measures of impulsivity predict risky actions such as

109
gambling, drinking, and risky sexual acts (cf. Cyders et al., 2007; 2010).
No studies have compared the relative predictive validity of cognitive
and self-report measures of impulsivity with risky behaviors among
healthy individuals.
Participants and Methods: Forty undergraduate students were administered the UPPS-P, a self-report measure of impulsivity (Cyders
et al. 2007) and the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST).To address
response bias, the Marlowe-Crowne Social Desirability Scale (MCSDS)
and the Reliable Digit Span (RDS) were assessed. Self-report retrospective measures of substance use, sexual activity, and antisocial behaviors during the preceding two months were obtained. No other variable
achieved significance.
Results: Multiple regression was used to evaluate the relative importance of the UPPS-P and WCST in accounting for impulsive behaviors.
Across the domains of risky actions, WCST perseverative errors achieved
significance (p’s<.01) and the semi-partial correlations ranged from .3
to .4. The UPPS-P accounted for significant variance only in antisocial
behaviors (r=.3).
Conclusions: Extending previous research, these data show that the
WCST is better able to account for risky actions than a well-validated
self-report measure of impulsivity. Although these data are based on
neurologically normal individuals, they lend support to the ecological
validity of neuropsychological tests in predicting functional outcomes.
These data are limited in that they rely entirely upon self-reported
risk-taking and do not include prospective data.

B.E. RIDGE, C.R. PENNINGTON, C.N. BRYSON, K.E. MCCALLUM,
K.K. MARSHALL & A. SCHMIDT. Connecting the Dots: Relating
Executive Dysfunction to the Externalizing Spectrum of
Psychopathology.
Objective: Research has demonstrated the connection between executive dysfunction and psychiatric disorders including antisocial behavior,
aggression, and substance use. Recent conceptualizations of psychopathology view these conditions as lying along a single externalizing
spectrum rather than clearly demarcated categories (see Krueger and
Markon 2006). Research is needed to investigate the full spectrum of
externalizing symptoms in order to clarify the presence of a common,
underlying propensity for executive dysfunction. The current study evaluates executive dysfunction in the context of a broad measure of externalizing behaviors. We hypothesized that executive functioning abilities
will be negatively associated with number of externalizing symptoms.
Participants and Methods: Participants included 150 undergraduate
students (37 males, 108 females; mean age = 20.2). Each participant
completed the Externalizing Spectrum Inventory – Brief Form (ESI-BF;
Patrick, Kramer, Krueger, & Markon, 2013), and several subtests from
the Delis-Kaplan Executive Function System (DKEFS) (i.e., Trail Making Test, Verbal Fluency, and Color-Word Interference).
Results: Contrary to our hypothesis, multiple regression analyses revealed consistently positive relationships between executive function
abilities and self-reported externalizing behaviors, with most approaching or achieving significance at the 0.05 level. Of note, additional statistical testing suggested these findings were robust and did not appear
caused by range restriction in DKEFS or ESI scores.
Conclusions: Findings suggest these neuropsychological measures may
not be sensitive to normal variations in executive dysfunction and disinhibition caused by personality features, as found in a non-clinical
sample. That is, it is possible that in a non-clinical sample, increases in
impulsivity and decreases in cognitive inhibition (as measured behaviorally by the ESI) may manifest as decreases in response times rather
than increases in errors on traditional neuropsychological tests.

A. RIVERA & L. ABRAMS. Competing bilingual advantages and
disadvantages: Performance on a linguistic Simon task.
Objective: The purpose of our study was to examine whether a bilingual
advantage in cognitive control will emerge when a task has a linguistic
component
Participants and Methods: Participants included 19 bilingual and 19
monolingual healthy young adults. All participants completed language
and background questionnaires. Proficiency was established using a
self-rating scale and a Spanish interview (for bilingual participants).
Participants received two versions of a modified Simon task. In the
linguistic (LS) version, stimuli were the color words blue and green
printed in black font either in English or in Spanish (azul or verde).
Participants were asked to indicate the color and ignore the language.
In the nonlinguistic (NLS) version, stimuli were blue and green-colored
rectangles, positioned vertically or horizontally and participants were
asked to indicate the color and ignore the orientation. For both tasks, a
stimulus appeared on the left or right side of the screen, and participants
were asked to press specific keys (z, on the left side, or /, on the right
side of the keyboard) to indicate the stimulus color. Congruent trials
occurred when the position of the stimulus matched the response key,
and incongruent trials occurred when these did not match.
Results: Reaction times were used to calculate an Interference effect
(IE=incongruent-congruent trials) and a Global effect (GE=average
of congruent and incongruent trials). Participants’ reaction times to
perform the NLS and LS tasks were compared. For both LS and NLS
versions, bilinguals showed a larger IE but a smaller GE.
Conclusions: Our findings suggest that the bilingual advantage differed as a function of whether the task did or did not have a linguistic
component and that the advantage emerged only in global RTs. Further
investigation is needed to establish the effect of linguistic tasks on cognitive control for both groups.

J.C. SHEEHAN & K.A. KERNS. A Tale of Two Towers: Investigation
of Tower Tasks in Preschool Children.
Objective: There is controversy regarding the utility of executive function (EF) tasks, such as the Tower of Hanoi /Tower of London in preschool-aged children. This study examined performance of these two
Tower tasks, along with other measures of EF adapted for preschoolers,
and a parent report of executive function.
Participants and Methods: 29 children ages 3-5 (M age= 55 months)
completed computerized versions of the Tower of Hanoi (ToH)/Tower
of London (ToL) tasks, as well as measures of inhibition, visuospatial
working memory (VS-WM), sustained attention, and shifting across
two testing sessions (one tower task per session). Not all children were
able to complete the Tower tasks, with many discontinuing before the
end of the task. Participants were divided into two groups based upon
discontinuation type (i.e., those who gave up, or “quit,” on the task and
those who reached DC criteria, or “non-quit”).
Results: While Tower performance in the group of children who were
unable to complete both Tower tasks was unrelated to any other EF
measure, in the children who were able to complete both tasks, the visuospatial working memory measure was strongly correlated with both the
ToH (r= -.760, p< .05) and ToL (r= -.907, p< .01). Independent-samples t-tests revealed no differences in mean performance on Towers and
other tasks of EF between groups, with the exception of the CPT, where
children who were not able to complete the Towers performed significantly worse than children who completed both (t(27)=2.155, p<.05).
Conclusions: Differences in sustained attention, rather than an ability
to successfully perform Tower tasks, may limit the ability to detect
relationships between performance on tower tasks and other cognitive
measures of EF. These findings suggest that VS-WM is highly related
to Tower task performance in those preschoolers who are able to attend
to the Tower tasks through their entirety. Further investigation of the
utility of preschool EF tasks is warranted.

H.L. SARGENIUS, F.W. BYLSMA, S. LYDERSEN & K. HESTAD. An
Examination of the Q-Score as a Method for Coding how Morbidly
Obese Subjects Copy the Rey-Osterrieth Complex Figure.
Objective: Several qualitative scoring systems aiming to capture
strategy and organization on the Rey-Osterrieth Complex Figure Test
(RCFT) exist. The Q-Score, which assumes that the subject should draw
the basic structural components first and then add the details in the most
efficient manner, has previously been found to fare particularly well
in healthy older adult populations. The objective of this study was to
investigate how this scoring system applies to an obese clinical sample.
Participants and Methods: 96 patients (74 female, 22 male) diagnosed with morbid obesity referred for either bariatric surgery (n=61)
or a non-invasive treatment program (n=35) at Innlandet Hospital
Trust completed the RCFT. A US normative sample consisting of 101
healthy controls within the same age range (18-60 years) was used as
comparison. The flowchart method was chosen in all cases to preserve
the drawing sequence on the Copy trial. Raw scores were standardized
and converted into age-adjusted T-scores.
Results: The Q-score did not correlate significantly with the Copy score
(r =.188, p =.067), but showed a significant positive correlation with
the Immediate Recall (r =.298, p =.003), and Delayed Recall (r =.29, p
=.004) of the figure. Compared to the normative sample, morbidly obese
patients scored significantly lower on the construction-organizational
measure (Q-Score: Estimate 45.86, 95% CI 43.79 to 47.92, p < .001).
Conclusions: Our findings suggest that morbidly obese individuals
have difficulty perceiving the stimulus figure as comprised of discrete
units with certain basic structural components. Problems with construction-organizational ability could be one of the major factors for
the development and maintenance of morbid obesity.

A Voxel Based Morphometric Analysis of Ventromedial Prefrontal
Cortex Volume related with Executive Function Task Performance
Post Mild Traumatic Injury.
Objective: Mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) is often associated with
subtle changes in executive functions. The frontal lobes, which contribute to complex executive functioning, are extremely vulnerable to
traumatic brain injury because of their size and location. Ventromedial
prefrontal cortex (VMPFC) is one of the areas of prefrontal cortex closely
associated with executive function tasks such as decision-making, judgment and self- monitoring. It is not known how the VMPFC and its
associated capacities change during the months following an mTBI.
We investigated the time dependent effects of mTBI on the volume of
VMPFC and its relationship with performance on executive function
tasks.
Participants and Methods: Voxel based morphometric analysis
(VBM8) was used to analyze T1 high resolution structural scans of
twenty six right handed mTBI participants (mean age=23.38). Segmented images were used to create a custom DARTEL template, and
then images were normalized and smoothed prior to analysis. VBM
data were correlated with time since injury. The volume data from the
resulting cluster were then extracted and correlated with metrics from
the Delis-Kaplan executive function system (DKEFS
Results: After controlling for age, gender and intracranial volume (ICV),
GM volume in VMPFC correlated positively with time since injury (FWE
corrected, p<0.05). VMPFC volume from this cluster was also found to
be positively correlated with performance on several DKEFS tasks such
as DKEFS-design fluency 1 (R2 =0.177), DKEFS-design fluency 2 (R2
= 0.164) and DKEFS-sorting test (R2 = 0.230).
Conclusions: VMPFC volume was greater with longer time since injury
post mTBI. While causal inference cannot be made, we speculate that

Forty Fourth Annual INS Meeting Abstracts
the greater volume in VMPFC with longer time since injury might reflect
a compensatory phenomenon of neural plasticity aiding in recovery of
cognitive functions post mTBI. Future work should examine whether
such volume changes can be facilitated by cognitive training.

E. SULLIVAN & C. NEUMANN. Assessing the Effect of Trauma
and PTSD Symptoms on Executive Functioning in a General
Population Sample.
Objective: Individuals with Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) frequently show deficits in both “cool” and “hot” executive functioning
(EF). Much less is known regarding EF in individuals who have experienced trauma, but do not meet full criteria for PTSD. The goal of this
study was to explore cool and hot EF in a non-clinical general population
sample. Hypotheses predicted significant relationships between trauma
experiences, symptoms of PTSD, and EF performance.
Participants and Methods: A total of 104 participants (M = 37.5 years;
SD = 10.58) from the general population were recruited through Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk). The majority of participants reported
a diverse range of past traumatic experiences. Assessments included
the Trauma History Questionnaire (THQ) and PTSD Checklist – Civilian Version (PCL-C), and traditional Stroop and modified emotional
Stroop tasks.
Results: Partial correlations, controlling for age, were performed to
examine the relationship between trauma experiences, PTSD symptoms,
and performance on the Stroop EF tasks. Number of traumatic experiences (r = .224, p < .05) and PCL-C scores (r = .409, p < .001) correlated with Stroop performance. Path analysis, using age as a covariate,
also demonstrated significant links between trauma, PTSD symptoms,
and both cool (Stroop) and hot (modified Stroop) EF (model fit: X(5)2
= 3.21, p = .99, CFI = 1.0, RMSEA = .00).
Conclusions: Using a diverse general population, the findings revealed
that trauma experiences and PTSD symptoms were linked with worse
EF. Results suggest trauma may have a compounding effect, with more
traumatic experiences linked to increasingly lower EF.

S.K. SULLIVAN, J.K. FAUSETT, J.L. GESS & G. JAMES. Personality
Correlates of Executive Function: The Role of Extraversion.
Objective: Extraversion, a personality trait characterized by a propensity for social interactions, reward-seeking, positive emotion, and high
energy, has recently been proposed to contribute to individual variation
in executive functioning (EF). Emerging evidence suggests similarities
in neurological substrates and neurotransmitter systems underlying both
extraversion and EF. Results have been variable, with several studies
reporting that specific facets of EF are differentially impaired or enhanced by higher levels of extraversion. This study extends the literature
by providing convergent and discriminant validity for the association
between extraversion and EF.
Participants and Methods: These data were collected through the Cognitive Connectome project, which seeks to map neural representations
of cognition in a normative sample of healthy adults (n=53; males and
females aged 18-50). The Big Five Inventory was used to explore the
relationship between the personality trait of extraversion and a variety
of neuropsychological measures.
Results: Extraversion was significantly negatively correlated with a
multitude of EF measures including variables from the WCST, D-KEFS
Trail Making Test, Stroop Color-Word test, Spatial Span, Digit Span,
and the Test of Everyday Attention, with correlation coefficients ranging
from moderate to large. Yet extraversion was not significantly associated
with domains of memory, language, and visuospatial ability, demonstrating discriminant validity.

111
Conclusions: Personality traits, oft-ignored in neuropsychology, may
contribute to individual differences in cognition. Our results suggest that
higher levels of extraversion are associated with poorer performance on
a variety of EF measures in healthy individuals. Given the number of
clinical syndromes that may result in impairments in EF, exploration
of personality correlates may help to clarify the ways in which these
disorders differentially impact the cognitive functioning of individuals.

B. TELLEZ-ALANIS, D. CASTELLANOS & A. BAZAN. Reasoning
and Behavioral Rating of Executive Function in Children Aged 1112 Years.
Objective: Although it is considered that executive functions (such as
cognitive flexibility, planning, working memory, attention) are directly
related to fluid intelligence, to date there is no definitive evidence. In
some studies this relationship was present, while in others the expected
relationship was absent. The purpose of this study was to explore
whether exists relationship between the behavioral rating of executive
function by parents and teachers and the results of a test of reasoning
completed by children aged 11-12 years.
Participants and Methods: The Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function (BRIEF) was used to evaluate executive functions and
to test the reasoning was used the Screening Assessment for Gifted
Elementary and Middle School Students (SAGES). BRIEF inventories
were answered by 178 teachers (of 86 children and 92 girls; mean age
11.9, SD = 0.3) and 235 were answered by parents (of 119 boys and
116 girls; mean age 11.8, SD = 0.4). The inventories were correlated
with the results achieved by children in the scale of reasoning SAGES.
On the scale of reasoning SAGES, the sample evaluated by teachers
obtained a mean of 93.7 (SD = 17.3) and the sample rated by parents
got 99.4 (SD = 18.3).
Results: No correlation was found between the scale of the reasoning
SAGES and any of the 8 subscales of BRIEF (planning, working memory, initiation, monitoring, material organization, inhibition, flexibility
and behavior control).
Conclusions: The results support the idea that executive functions are
independent of intellectual functions such as reasoning. However, it
is important to consider that this result arises from an indirect rating
(by teachers and parents) of executive function. Therefore, to confirm
this result it is necessary to test directly the children behavior using
neuropsychological tasks.

Executive Function Deficits In Preterm Children.
Objective: Children born very preterm (<33 weeks gestational age
(GA); VPT) who are deemed “healthy” by medical professionals are
often found to be at higher risk for behavioral and academic difficulties
compared to children born full-term (FT), particularly executive functions (EF). Little is known about the transition from preschool to formal
school in healthy VPT children; therefore, information is limited on how
to best to provide support to these children who are most at risk. Here we
report on the relationship between a child-friendly behavioral measure
of inhibitory control, attention, and working memory, the Head-ToesKnees-Shoulders (HTKS) Task (McClelland et al., 2007; 2014), and a
standardized parent report measure, the Behavior Rating Inventory of
Executive Function (BRIEF.)
Participants and Methods: We tested 39 VPT children (M GA at birth:
29.56 weeks; M FSIQ=104.0; M age=5.9 years) and 24 FT children
(M FSIQ=105.3, M age=5.8 years). In the first block of HTKS trials,
children were instructed to touch their toes when told, “Touch your
head” and vice versa. In the second block, they were to touch their knees

112
when told, “Touch your shoulders”, and vice versa. Each child’s primary
caregiver also completed the age-appropriate Parent Form of the BRIEF.
Results: The VPT group scored significantly lower than the FT group
on HTKS Block 1 (M=15.31 vs. 17.58, max. 20; p=0.048), indicating
greater difficulty with the task’s initial demands. Significant group differences were found on the BRIEF Emotional Control, Shift, and Inhibit
scales, with the VPT group exhibiting significantly greater behavioral
dysfunction according to parental report. Performance on the HTKS
was also significantly correlated with the BRIEF Emotional Control,
Shift, and Inhibit scores.
Conclusions: Our results suggest that young “healthy” VPT children
are at significant risk of EF deficits in emotional control, shifting, and
inhibitory control, both from a behavioral perspective and according to
parent report of everyday functioning.

Performance Differences on the Iowa Gambling Task in High
Versus Low Schizotypy.
Objective: In attempting to better understand the etiology of psychotic
disorders such as schizophrenia, research has sought to investigate cognitive and behavioral correlates among healthy individuals with elevated schizotypal traits. Prior research has demonstrated emotion-based
decision-making deficits on the Iowa Gambling Task (IGT) in those
with schizophrenia. However, whether similar deficits exist in individuals exhibiting high levels of schizotypy remains largely unexamined.
Given both the social-emotional and executive functioning impairments
documented in the schizotypy literature, the current study sought to
investigate emotion-based decision making in those with high versus
low levels of schizotypy.
Participants and Methods: Ninety-five undergraduate students completed the Schizotypal Personality Questionnaire (SPQ) and the IGT
to assess the relationship between schizotypal personality traits and
emotion-based decision-making.
Results: Consistent with our hypothesis, independent samples t-tests
revealed that individuals in the high schizotypy group exhibited significantly poorer emotion-based decision-making than those in the low
schizotypy group (p < .05).
Conclusions: These results suggest that individuals with heightened
schizotypal personality features may exhibit dampened emotion-based
decision-making abilities. Moreover, reduced performance in emotion-based decision-making may reflect preexisting impairments in social-emotional processing and executive functioning observed in those
with elevated schizotypy. Thus, a decreased capacity for making emotion-based decisions may serve as a unique endophenotypic marker in
identifying those at risk for later development of psychosis.

A.B. VANDEN BUSSCHE, C.B. PADULA, N. HAUG, K. GRISANZIO,
N. CHOWDHRY & L.M. WILLIAMS. Assessing the Impact of
Trauma on Hot and Cold Executive Functions Independent of
Diagnosis.
Objective: Traumatic experiences have been shown to impair cognition
in domains of attention, executive functioning (EF), and memory. We
aimed to assess if trauma disrupts hot EF, such as emotion identification, as well as cold EF, such as sustained attention, inhibition, and
planning. We examined if the relationship between trauma-impaired
EF holds for trauma-exposed individuals who do not meet criteria for
posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and if the relationship is specific
to trauma and not related to mood.
Participants and Methods: A total of 38 participants (23F, 14M, and
1T, aged 19-61 years), were included. Participants were unmedicated

and recruited from the community. Participants were comprised of a
PTSD group (n=10), a Trauma-Exposed no-PTSD group (n=20), and
a no-trauma, but Mood Symptoms group (n=8). Groups were age, gender, and education matched. Participants completed the computerized
WebNeuro cognitive battery. One-way ANOVAs examined Continuous
Performance, Verbal Interference, and Maze tests of cold EF and Emotion Identification for hot EF, interpreted at p<.05.
Results: We observed group differences in hot EF for the identification of fearful (p=0.001), angry (p=0.012), and sad (p=0.007) facial
expressions. Contrasts showed that the PTSD group was distinguished
by enhanced negative emotion identification compared to both Trauma-Exposed and Mood Symptoms groups. For cold EF, we observed
differences in Continuous Performance Test (p=0.029). This effect was
due to poorer sustained attention in the Mood Symptoms group compared to the PTSD and Trauma Exposed groups.
Conclusions: Trauma exposure, regardless of diagnosis, may produce
a bias toward negative emotion and enhance hot EF. However, disruptions to cold EF may relate to depression and anxiety rather than
trauma exposure. These preliminary findings warrant replication in
larger samples, and validation using additional cognitive and neuroimaging measures.

All for one: Combined contributions of executive functioning and
social cognition to moral reasoning in childhood.
Objective: Moral reasoning (MR) is a sociocognitive skill essential to
appropriate social functioning in childhood and which evolves in quality
and complexity during ontogenetic development. The aim of this study
was to explore what factors predict moral maturity in children and
identify the specific contributions of age, executive functioning (EF) (inhibition and verbal fluency) and social cognition (theory of mind (ToM)
and affect recognition) using an innovative visual MR assessment tool.
Participants and Methods: The children’s version of the Socio-Moral
Reasoning Aptitude Level task (So-Moral-Child, Beauchamp et al.,
2013) was used to account for children’s reality and developmental
stages of MR. The So-Moral, ToM Cartoon Stories (Brune, 2005), and
three subtests of the NEPSY-II battery (Inhibition, Word generation and
Affect Recognition) were administered to 76 healthy developing children
aged 6 to 12 years (M=9.2, SD=1.67 years, 53% female).
Results: MR maturity was positively correlated with age, inhibition, verbal fluency, ToM, and affect recognition skills. A three-steps hierarchical
multiple regression indicates that age explains 28% of MR maturity and
that verbal fluency explains an additional 5% of this variable. Taking
socio-cognitive variables (ToM and affect recognition) into account in
the model explains an additional 8% of MR maturity. In the final model,
verbal fluency (β=.24, p=.041) and ToM (β=.22, p=.030) were significant individual predictors of MR maturity in childhood.
Conclusions: These results contribute to a better understanding of
the underpinnings of MR during childhood, suggesting that MR is not
reducible to general developmental factors such as age, but that specific
higher order skills such as verbal fluency and social cognition contribute
to MR. These findings have relevance for both typically developing and
clinical populations in which social skills may be reduced, as well as for
the identification of potential loci for intervention in children at-risk for
socially maladaptive behaviours.

L.C. VOS & R.D. WHITMAN. The Relationship between Creativity,
Intelligence, and Executive Function.
Objective: This study examined the relationship between creativity, intelligence, and executive functioning in a non-clinical, adult population.

Forty Fourth Annual INS Meeting Abstracts
Theory and research indicate relationships among these constructs, but
the nature and degree to which the constructs overlap is unclear.
Participants and Methods: Ninety-five university students, ages 18 to
50, completed the Gough Creative Personality Scale, the IPIP Creativity
Scale adapted from the HEXACO, the Test of Premorbid Functioning
(TOPF) and the Delis Kaplan Executive Function System (DKEFS).
Using the factor structure found by Latzman and Markon (2010), composites were created to measure three factors of executive functioning:
Inhibition, Monitoring and Conceptual Flexibility.
Results: Scores from the two creativity scales were moderately correlated (r = .36, p < .001). The creativity measures were not correlated
with the TOPF. The TOPF was moderately to strongly correlated with
all three factors of executive functioning (r = .43-.58, p < .001). Regression analyses were conducted with the two creativity questionnaires and
the TOPF as predictors of the three factors of executive functioning. All
overall models were significant (p < .001), and the TOPF was a strong,
significant predictor in all models. The IPIP creativity scale score was
not a significant predictor in any model. The Gough Creative Personality
Scale significantly predicted Monitoring (β = .244, p = .016).
Conclusions: Intelligence was a strong predictor of executive functioning, whereas creativity only predicted Monitoring. It is possible that creativity only affects executive functioning in tasks that allow for divergent
thinking (e.g. verbal fluency tasks), but does not play a role in solving
problems in which there is a defined answer. This study is limited by
the use of self-report creativity measures; future research will investigate
these relationships using performance-based measures of creativity.

on the “Heat” of Cool Executive Function Tasks.
Objective: We examined task context and participant individual differences with respect to the relative heat of two “cool” EF tasks, exploring
the change in performance with heating, as well as associations with
individual differences in personality.
Participants and Methods: Forty-four college students were administered: cool EF tasks, Tower of London (TOL) and Letter-Number
Sequencing (LNS), hot EF task, IGT, and the Psychopathic Personality
Inventory-Revised (PPI-R). The heating manipulation involved awarding state lottery tickets for achieving certain performance targets on EF
tasks. Incentive (heating) alternated across blocks of trials for the TOL,
counterbalancing order, was offered for the second trial in each pair of
LNS sequences, and given if the IGT ended with a net gain.
Results: Performance on the Cool TOL and LNS did not significantly
correlate, but did under hot conditions. The Hot (incentivized) TOL
performance correlated with the PPI-R subscales at a rate five times
higher than did Cool TOL performance. The Order variable interacted
with the heating manipulation; hot TOL score was higher for those who
began the task with heating than those who began the task with cool
items, with no effect on the cool TOL score. Those who received the
heating first exhibited a within person increase in performance with
heating, while those receiving heating in the second block exhibited a
decrease in accuracy with heating. This order effect was not moderated
by sex or personality/temperament individual differences.
Conclusions: Heating resulted in a stronger correlation between performances on the TOL and LNS, and a larger number of associations
with personality. Order of the heating manipulation affected TOL performance with a greater impact on increasing accurate performance
when introduced at the task start, a factor that needs to be considered
when manipulating task context within subjects in heating studies. The
within-subjects design posed statistical power challenges to examine
potential variable interactions.

in age, ethnicity, and education). A smaller Control Group of men (N
= 61) living in transitional housing (demographically similar) did not
receive the BrainWise curriculum. Participants were administered the
pretests and posttests of the following self-reports: 1) Behavior Rating
Inventory of Executive Functions for Adults (BRIEF), Wasik Problem-Solving Rating Scale (WPRS), Coping Self-Efficacy (CSE), and
BrainWise Knowledge Survey (BKS; survey of critical thinking skills
taught in the program).
Results: The four measures were in the acceptable range of reliability
(internal consistency) at both the pretest and the posttest and showed
adequate test-retest stability. Scores on the measures intercorrelated
significantly and in the expected direction; e.g., problems with executive functions on the BRIEF predicted lower skills in BrainWise
knowledge, problem solving, and coping self-efficacy. Examining the
groups separately due to large sample size difference, dependent t-tests
demonstrated significant Pretest to Posttest changes on ALL measures
in Treatment Group (N=108) with the exception of the WPRS. In contrast, in Control Group (N=37), there were significant improvements in
fewer BRIEF subscales, no changes in BKS, and CSE, and a significant
decrease in WPRS.
Conclusions: The self-report measures were reliable in this very vulnerable population. Importantly, adding BrainWise to a slate of education
programs yielded significant improvements in BrainWise knowledge,
coping self-efficacy, and all subscales of the BRIEF executive function
measure, as compared to improvements in only a small set of EF skills
in the Control Group.

C. WILSON, A.E. PRITCHARD, L.A. JACOBSON, J. SCHIFFMAN
& T. ZABEL. Clinical Utility of the Barkley Deficits in Executive
Functioning-Children and Adolescents Scale in a Mixed Clinical
Sample.
Objective: The Barkley Deficits in Executive Functioning–Children
and Adolescents (BDEFS-CA) scale is a parent-rated measure of executive functioning (EF) for ages 6-17. Despite its various construction
strengths, studies addressing the validity of the BDEFS-CA are limited.
Moreover, existing validity studies have reported correlation with other
measures, but have not addressed comparability regarding the identification of EF deficits. The validity and clinical utility of the BDEFS-CA
was examined relative to a similar parent report measure of EF; the
Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function (BRIEF). We hypothesized that several of the BDEFS-CA scales would identify symptoms of
EF deficit in a manner consistent with the BRIEF index scores.
Participants and Methods: Parent ratings from the BRIEF and
BDEFS-CA were obtained in a sample of 59 children and adolescents
(11.11±3.12 years; 58.2% male) referred for neuropsychological
assessment.
Results: The BRIEF General Executive Composite score (GEC;
M=63.98±12.95) was strongly correlated with the BDEFS-CA EF
Summary score (EFS; r(59)=.85, p<.001). ROC analysis suggested

114
that the BDEFS-CA EFS performed significantly better than chance
in predicting BRIEF GEC scores (AUC=0.94, p< .001). Correlations
between BDEFS-CA and BRIEF indices ranged from medium to strong
[r(59)=.48-.82, p<.001]. BDEFS-CA Self-Management to Time was
most strongly correlated with BRIEF MI, and BDEFS-CA Self-Restraint
was most strongly correlated with BRIEF BRI. Clinical categorization using the BDEFS-CA scales to predict deficits on BRIEF indices (T-scores
≥ 65) showed excellent specificity but lower sensitivity, particularly
for males.
Conclusions: In this preliminary examination, the BDEFS-CA demonstrated utility in screening children for EF deficits identified using the
BRIEF. Several specific BDEFS-CA scales are well calibrated to identify EF deficits in a manner similar to the BRIEF MI and BRI scales,
although there is a risk of false negative categorizations when using the
BDEFS-CA with males.

Utility of Tower of London in Identifying Executive Impairment
in Children with ADHD and/or Learning Disability.
Objective: The Tower of London (TOL) is a commonly used measure of
executive functioning (EF) and is frequently utilized in the assessment
of children with ADHD and/or learning disabilities (LD). While EF
dysfunction has been consistently documented in these populations,
the sensitivity of the TOL to such dysfunction has not been clearly
demonstrated in children with LD. Our aim was to assess whether the
TOL is sensitive to EF dysfunction in children with LD and whether it
is helpful in distinguishing ADHD from LD.
Participants and Methods: 95 clinically-referred children (ages 7-18;
63% males; ADHD n=42, SLD n=14, ADHD/SLD n=39) were administered the TOL as part of a comprehensive battery which included
measures of intellectual functioning and academic achievement.
Results: Children with comorbid ADHD/LD diagnoses performed
significantly poorer than those with ADHD alone on measures of intellectual functioning (101.43 vs. 91.13; t(64)=3.08, p<.01). While
children with LD alone performed more poorly than those with ADHD,
these differences were not significant. There were no group differences
on any TOL variables. However, examination of rates of impairment
across groups reflected that children with LD or comorbid ADHD/LD
were twice as likely to show impairment on the Total Moves score than
children with just ADHD. Nearly a third of each group showed deficits in
execution time and half of each group showed excessive rule violations.
Total items correct was least sensitive to impairment. Lastly, all TOL
variables were weakly to moderately correlated with intelligence (r=
.18-.33, p<.05), total moves and total time were moderately correlated
with reading (r= .31-.35, p<.01), and weak relations were observed
between TOL variables and math skills.
Conclusions: In our sample of children with ADHD and/or LD, children with comorbid ADHD/LD performed worse across measures of
IQ, reading, and math. No group differences were observed across TOL
variables. While TOL appears to be sensitive to EF dysfunction, it has
limited specificity.

M.M. WONG, K.J. BROWER, D.A. CONROY, S.M. LYNCH &
C. WILLIAMS. Sleep quality and neuropsychological functioning
among children of alcoholics and controls.
Objective: This study examined whether and how parental alcohol use
disorder (AUD) and sleep variables are associated with neuropsychological functioning. Previous research showed that children with a biological
AUD parent had lower executive functioning vs. controls (Deckel &
Hesselbrock, 1996; Nigg et al., 2004, 2006). Studies also reported that

poor sleep predicted lower response inhibition (Wong et al., 2010) and
higher emotional reactivity (Yoo et al., 2007; Talbot et al., 2010). However, few studies looked at whether parental AUD and sleep variables
are associated with children’s neuropsychological functioning.
Participants and Methods: Study participants were 40 children
(42.5% girls), ages 8 to 12 from an ongoing longitudinal study. Wave
1 cross-sectional data are presented here. Sleep was assessed by actigraphy for one week. From these data, we derived three sleep variables:
average sleep efficiency (SE), average sleep onset latency (SOL) and
average wake time after sleep onset (WASO). Neuropsychological functioning was assessed about 2-12 weeks after actigraphy. Three measures
were examined – Wisconsin Card Sort (WICS), Delis-Kaplan Executive
System Trailmaking Task and nonverbal working memory from the
Stanford-Binet Intelligence Scale.
Results: Parental AUD status significantly interacted with WASO to
predict Wisconsin Card Sort perseverative errors (b = -1.55 (.69), p
< .05). Among children with an AUD parent, WASO significantly predicted perseverative errors (b = -.77 (.32), p < .05). Longer WASO was
associated with worse performance (i.e., more errors) in these children.
This relationship was not observed among controls b = .78 (.67), p =
.30). Parental AUD status, SE and SOL did not predict any neuropsychological variables.
Conclusions: In conclusion, poor sleep quality (i.e., WASO) was associated with more errors in an executive function task among children
with one or more alcoholic parents. An important limitation of this
study was the small sample size. (Supported by NIH R01 AA020364)

Reaction to Novelty as a Predictor of Reduced Executive
Functioning Following an Expressive Suppression Task.
Objective: Expressive suppression (ES), or effortful regulation of facial
affect, can subsequently cause a temporary decline in executive functioning (EF) performance (Franchow, 2014). Additionally, increased
reaction time due to novelty (termed the “novelty effect [NE]”) on a
motor sequencing task is associated with future cognitive decline in older
adults (Suchy, 2011), suggesting that difficulty adapting to novelty may
signal preclinical declines in EF. We investigated whether a larger NE
would also be related to individual differences in the degree to which
EF performance was impacted by an ES task.
Participants and Methods: Community-dwelling older adults (n=102,
age 60-86) completed selected subtests of the Delis-Kaplan Executive
Function System (DKEFS) before and after viewing a compilation of
disgusting and amusing videos. Participants were randomly assigned to
one of two conditions: maintaining neutral affect during the video (ES
condition), or reacting naturally (control condition). Participants also
completed a computerized motor sequencing task (Push Turn Taptap
task; PTT) designed to assess the NE, and the Geriatric Depression
Scale. Consistent with past research, the NE was computed as the difference between the median planning time for the first block and second
block of the PTT task.
Results: Controlling for age, sex, education, and depressive symptoms,
those in the ES condition who also demonstrated a large NE showed
reduced EF performance, compared both to those in the ES condition
with a small NE and to controls (F(1, 90) = 4.0, p =.047).
Conclusions: These findings suggest that sensitivity to novelty is related
to the degree of EF depletion following ES in older adults. This supports the idea that there are measurable individual differences in how
susceptible an individual’s performance is to cognitive stressors, which
may be indicative of subclinical cognitive decline.

M. ZUMBA, M. DRAGULIN, D. DEBOER, E. IRONSIDE,
J. EGUSQUIZA, S. PAWAR & T. LAFAVOR. Effect of Trauma
Exposure on Cognitive Functioning in a Sample of High-risk
Adults.
Objective: Studies suggest that most adults experience one or more
Potentially Traumatic Event (PTE), defined as an event outside the
range of usual human experience that causes distress (Bonanno, 2005).
Extreme and/or chronic stress has also been associated with decreased
executive function (EF) (Verfaellie, Lafleche, Spiro, & Bousquet, 2014).
However, results have been mixed, supporting a need for further study
(Golier & Yehuda, 2002). The purpose of this study was to examine the
relationship between socioeconomic status (SES), trauma exposure, and
cognitive functioning in adults.
Participants and Methods: Twelve English speaking participants
(mean age = 31, 100% female), were administered verbal and perceptual reasoning tasks, and performance based measures of EF including
cognitive flexibility, problem solving, and self-monitoring. Participants
were interviewed about demographic information, and negative, neutral,
and positive life events. These measures have been used successfully with
low income families in multiple studies.
Results: Results from this study examined the relationship between
cognitive function and trauma exposure in a diverse sample of adults.
Adults with a significant trauma history scored lower on cognitive measures compared to normative samples. Card sorting performance was
marginally lower in those with a trauma history, compared to non-traumatized participants. Broadly, risk and negative life events were related
to low perceptual reasoning and cognitive flexibility.
Conclusions: These findings are generally consistent with previous
research and demonstrate the importance of examining the effect of
trauma on higher cognitive functioning. Significant findings in such a
small sample underscore the need for larger studies in this population
in order to inform intervention and prevention efforts.

J. ESTEPP, J. MARTIN, B. AYGUN & W. WANG. Neurocognitive
Functioning among Young Patients with Sickle Cell Disease:
Associations with Demographic and Disease-related Factors.
Objective: Children with sickle cell disease (SCD) are at risk for neurocognitive problems due to the adverse impact the disease can have
on the central nervous system. However, a disproportionate number of
children with SCD come from lower socioeconomic (SES) households,
and lower SES is also associated with poor neurocognitive development.
The present study examined associations among medical indicators of
disease severity (genotype, hemoglobin level), SES factors (maternal
education, family income), and neurocognitive functioning in preschool
and early school age patients with SCD.
Participants and Methods: Fifty-one children with SCD underwent a
neurocognitive evaluation at a mean age of 5.1 (SD=1.1) years. Neurobehavioral evaluations were performed because of clinical concerns or
as part of local standard of clinical practice. Disease-related information
was obtained from medical record review. Bivariate Pearson correlations
were used to examine association among variables.
Results: Maternal education was positively correlated with Wechsler
IQ score [r(45)=.30, p=.04] and the Bracken School Readiness Assessment (SRA) [r(34)=.31, p=.07], and negatively correlated with parent
report of concerns regarding their child’s executive function from the
Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function (BRIEF): Shifting
[r(37)=-.58, p<.01], Emotional Control [r(37)=-.40, p=.01], Working
Memory [r(37)=-.36, p=.03]. Family income was correlated with IQ
score [r(27)= .46, p=.02] and SRA [r(20)= .50, p=.03]. Genotype and

115
hemoglobin level were not significantly associated with neurocognitive
outcomes, p>.05.
Conclusions: Cognitive functioning, school readiness and a measure
of executive functioning were significantly correlated with demographic
variables but not with medical indicators of disease severity. Results
suggest that SES has a greater impact on neurocognitive functioning
in younger children with SCD than medical factors. Further study is
needed to disentangle the impact of environment versus disease factors.

Attention and Executive Functions Following Proton Beam
Radiation Therapy in Pediatric Patients with Brain Tumors.
Objective: Treatment for pediatric brain tumors (BTs) is associated
with cognitive changes, including decreased attention and executive
dysfunction. In comparison with surgical resection and chemotherapy,
cranial radiation therapy (RT) has been linked to the greatest cognitive
declines, which are thought to arise from post-treatment reductions in
white matter volumes. Proton Beam RT (PBRT), which spares more
healthy brain tissue than conventional photon RT, may mitigate cognitive late effects. This study is one of the first to examine cognitive
functioning in pediatric patients with BTs who received PBRT.
Participants and Methods: Participants included 39 patients (6-18
years old) with BTs who underwent PBRT. As part of a larger test battery, they completed the Conners’ Continuous Performance Test – 2nd
Edition (CPT-II) and the D-KEFS Trail Making Test (TMT) at 3.61
years (SD = 2.03; range = 1.16 - 7.43) post PBRT. Their test performance was compared to that of normative samples.
Results: Patients’ scores across CPT-II indices did not differ significantly from test norms. However, patients were slower on Number Sequencing (p<.0001), Letter Sequencing (p=.001), and Number-Letter
Switching (p<.0001) subtests of the TMT than the normative sample.
No difference in number of errors on TMT Switching was detected
(p=.66).
Conclusions: In contrast with some studies examining patients who
received conventional RT, our sample did not show deficits in sustained
attention. However, results were suggestive of weaknesses in processing
speed, sequencing, and cognitive flexibility. Although these aspects of
executive functioning were less efficient in patients versus the normative
sample, the lack of difference in errors suggests that BT patients have the
ability to engage these skills with extra time. Findings provide support
for accommodations in educational settings (e.g., provision of additional
time for assignments). Additionally, results may be suggestive of cognitive sparing with PBRT, although further investigation is warranted.

Executive Dysfunction and Social Maladjustment among Children
with Congenital Heart Disease.
Objective: Children with congenital heart disease (CHD) often exhibit
difficulty with higher order cognitive abilities, including executive
functioning (Calderon & Bellinger, 2015). Recently, researchers have
considered how executive dysfunction among children with CHD can
adversely impact their quality of life, particularly in the social domain.
Yet, most findings have focused on measures of social cognition rather
than adjustment in everyday social settings (e.g., Calderon et al., 2010).
As such, this study examined the relationship between executive functioning and social adjustment among children with CHD.
Participants and Methods: Participants were 56 children with CHD
(59% male; M age = 9.87 years), referred to an outpatient neuropsychology clinic. Measures of executive functioning tapped core and complex
skills (Diamond, 2013), including working memory (WISC-4 WMI),

116
inhibition (CPT-II Commissions), mental flexibility (Trails B), fluid
reasoning (WISC-4 Matrix Reasoning), and planning (Tower of London). Social problems and peer relation problems were assessed with
parent- and teacher-ratings (ASEBA, Conners’ Rating Scales).
Results: A multivariate regression model was specified with executive
functions predicting social outcomes. Both poorer flexibility and reasoning were associated with greater parent-rated peer relation problems
(βs < -0.39, ps < .05); poorer planning was associated with greater
teacher-rated social and peer relation problems (βs < -0.55, ps < .05).
Interestingly, working memory was positively related to parent and
teacher-rated peer relation problems, after controlling for other executive skills (βs > 0.55, ps < .001).
Conclusions: As with healthy children (Jacobson et al., 2011), executive functions, particularly complex skills, were associated with social
adjustment among children with CHD. This may have important implications for future cognitive and social interventions in this population, as concurrently addressing both areas may be more effective than
targeting one domain.

D.J. BEARDEN & C. MRAKOTSKY. Cognitive, School, and
Emotional Functioning in Children and Adolescents with
Recurrent Abdominal Pain.
Objective: Recurrent abdominal pain (RAP) is a common problem
among children and adolescents, occurring without an identified organic
etiology. Research suggests that children with RAP experience more
emotional problems than healthy controls. Despite identified emotional
difficulties in this population, to date little is known about cognitive and
school problems in young patients with RAP. Therefore, the current
study compared cognitive, school, and emotional function between RAP
patients and healthy controls.
Participants and Methods: This study included 27 children and
adolescents (age 8-16 years) with RAP and 37 healthy controls who
participated in a larger study examining cognitive functions in gastrointestinal conditions. Both groups underwent assessments of cognitive
ability, emotional functioning, and quality of life (e.g., WASI, BRIEF,
YSR, PEDS-QL). Groups were comparable on demographic variables.
We examined group differences using independent t-tests and ANOVA/
ANCOVA analyses. Associations between pain and primary outcomes
were examined using correlation analyses.
Results: Overall intellectual ability in the RAP group was significantly
lower than in the control group (p <.001). The RAP group endorsed
significantly more executive problems (p = .015), internalizing (p =
.001) and externalizing behaviors (p = .03), and school problems than
controls (p = .002). Within the RAP group, more severe pain was associated with more executive and emotional problems. Executive function
and emotional problems were negatively associated with school function.
Conclusions: Compared to healthy children and adolescents, patients
with RAP demonstrated lower overall cognitive ability and more self-reported problems with executive function, internalizing and externalizing
behaviors, and school.

J. CALDERON, PH.D., A.R. CASSIDY, PH.D., J.W. NEWBURGER,
MD, MPH & D.C. BELLINGER, PHD, MSC. Cognitive Predictors of
Social Cognition Outcomes in Adolescents with Congenital Heart
Disease after Infant Open-Heart Surgery.
Objective: Survivors of Congenital Heart Disease (CHD) are at risk for
neurodevelopmental dysfunction. Theory of Mind deficits and Autism
Spectrum Disorder symptoms are associated with CHD. Despite the
high frequency of these deficits, no study has investigated the underlying cognitive mechanisms of social cognition impairments. Our aim is

to identify cognitive predictors of social cognition in CHD. By using a
construct-driven approach, we sought to identify the contributions of
executive functions, speed of processing, verbal abilities and visual-perceptual skills to performances on the Reading the Mind in the Eyes
Test (RMET) and the Autism Spectrum Quotient (ASQ) questionnaire.
Participants and Methods: This study reports findings from 159 adolescents with CHD after open-heart surgery (Mage=14 years 2 mo;
SD= 2 years 3 mo; n=68 with Tetralogy of Fallot and n=91 with Single-Ventricle CHD), without associated genetic syndromes. All patients
underwent a complete neuropsychological assessment (e.g. WISC-IV;
BRIEF Parent, D-KFES). Scores were transformed into Z-scores and
theory-driven composite constructs were computed (i.e. Working Memory; Inhibitory Control; Cognitive Flexibility; Planning; Processing
Speed; Verbal and Visual-Perceptual skills). Adjusted regression models including all constructs were used to identify significant predictors
of social cognition.
Results: The mean IQ score in the CHD group was within normative values (m=94 ± 17.8). Multivariate adjusted models showed that
only verbal abilities significantly predicted performance on the RMET
(β=0.37; SE=0.13; p<0.01). In contrast, cognitive flexibility significantly predicted self-reported Autism Spectrum symptoms on the ASQ
(β=0.47; SE=0.17; p<0.01). There was a marginally significant contribution of verbal abilities to ASQ outcomes (p=0.07).
Conclusions: Among adolescents with CHD, deficits in key aspects of
social cognition are associated with verbal and higher-order executive
function abilities.

A.M. CHAMBERS, A.L. FRIAS, A. ORTEGA, E.M. MELLOTT
& S.C. HEATON. The Relationship Between Childhood Sleep
Initiation Problems and Verbal Memory.
Objective: Learning is an important component of the memory process
and can be disrupted by a variety of phenomena seen in childhood.
Though sleep problems are known to affect some cognitive functions,
little is known about the relationship between sleep disturbance and
verbal memory impairments in pediatric disorders. Furthermore, there
is a scarcity of research examining the developmental aspects of this
relationship. The current study sought to identify sleep symptoms that
predict verbal learning.
Participants and Methods: Participants included 135 children ages
2-17 with developmental and neurological conditions referred for neuropsychological assessment. Parent-reported child sleep behaviors were
assessed using the Heaton Children’s Sleep Questionnaire (HCSQ), and
learning was assessed using the Children’s Memory Scale (CMS), Word
Pairs Learning. Child’s age at time of assessment was used to examine
potential moderating effects of developmental stage.
Results: Parent-report of child sleep initiation problems was significantly associated with poor learning performance on the CMS Word
Pairs subtest (r=.159, p=.033). Follow up bootstrapped moderation
analysis indicated that this relationship was strengthened for youth
ages 9-12, although age was not a significant moderator for the model
as a whole (R2=.03).
Conclusions: Findings suggest that problems with sleep initiation may
be a useful predictor of poor memory functioning in clinical pediatric
populations, particularly for pre-adolescent youth. Further research is
needed to confirm these findings using objectively measured sleep onset
latency and to better understand the moderating effects of age. Nonetheless, current findings provide intriguing preliminary evidence for
targeting sleep onset latency among youth with memory dysfunction.

L.O. CONDIE. Adapted Developmental Assessment for Ages 18
months to 7 years.
Objective: Neurodevelopmental assessment measures typically are designed to address global developmental delay, but without sufficient
provisions for children with significant visual, auditory, or motor impairment. This session describes a qualitative and criterion-references
measure appropriate for children with significant visual, auditory, and
or motor impairment.
Participants and Methods: Children ages 18 months to 7 years were
seen in a convenience sample clinical setting to set the ranges of the
measure, to establish inter-rater reliability, and to address the goodness
of fit between the measure and resultant recommendations. Items in the
measure were rated for suitability of use with children who have cortical and non-cortical visual impairments, children with hearing impairments, and children with significant hemiparesis, diplegia, hypotonia
and hypertonia.
Results: Interrater reliability was .89, items were selected for goodness
of fit for the populations of interest (across populations), items were
vetted for face validity, consensual validity, and construct validity, and
results were rated for reliability in terms of (a) category of development,
and (b) goodness of fit between findings and recommendations. Ratings
on outcomes are pending. Parent ratings of comfort with the tool relative
to standardized tools are pending.
Conclusions: The Adapted Developmental Assessment measure provides the neurodevelopmental evaluator with a tool that allows for
greater participation from children with significant visual, auditory,
and motor impairments. It has a lower floor than existing standardized
assessment tools, it provides a means for children to participate who
otherwise likely would be given only parent questionnaire measures,
and preliminary results show that parents have a greater level of comfort with the measure and recommendations that those gleaned from
standardized assessment tools that do not account for their children’s
disabilities.

J. DOXIE, M. COHEN, K. LEISER, A. HEFFELFINGER &
A. KAUGARS. The Impact of Parental Stress in the Relationship
Between Verbal IQ and Adaptive Functioning in Children with
Early Neurological Insult.
Objective: Children with neurological insult or disorder are at risk for
impairments in adaptive functioning. Variations in these impairments
may lie in the severity and type of disorder or injury; however other
individual and environmental factors may attribute to variable adaptive outcomes. One factor consistently linked to adaptive functioning is
that of cognitive development, however the mechanisms influencing the
strength of the relationship are unclear. Parental stress is one mechanism
that is important in examining the link in children with neurological
insults. The aim of the current study is to examine parental appraisal of
stress as a moderator in the association between cognitive development
(as assessed by verbal IQ) and adaptive functioning.
Participants and Methods: Study participants included 72 preschool
children with neurological insults or disorders and their primary caregivers. Primary caregivers completed rating scales and a structured
clinical interview about perceived stress as well as their child’s adaptive functioning. Children were administered standardized measures
of intellectual functioning. Study hypotheses were examined through
hierarchical multiple regression analysis.
Results: Parent appraisal of stress was found to moderate the relationship between verbal IQ and total adaptive functioning, as well as the
adaptive subscales of communication and socialization. In each of these
interactions, the relationships between IQ and adaptive functioning were
stronger for children whose parents had low appraisal of stress.
Conclusions: These results reflect how stress may impact the social and
communications skills in the day to day functioning of young children
with neurological insults. Decreases in the strength of the relationship

117
between verbal IQ and adaptive functioning among high stress parents
may be related to the tendency for parents to verbally teach these skills
to their children; as well as the ability of stress to prevent the teaching
of these skills.

Children with Chiari Malformation Type 1.
Objective: Chiari malformation type I (CM1) is defined by cerebellar
tonsillar herniation below the level of the Foramen Magnum (deSouza,
Zador, & Frim, 2011). Individuals with CM1 have been documented to
display attention, memory and executive deficits (Dunn et al., 2014).

(DS) (Duddy et al., 2014), but the cognitive impact of this neurosurgical
intervention has never been investigated. The present study examines
the neuropsychological functioning of a cohort of children post-DS.
Participants and Methods: Children with CM1 aged 6 years, 0 months
to 17 years, 11 months were recruited under an IRB protocol. Participants completed a semi-structured interview and neuropsychological
tests, including the California Verbal Learning Test-Children’s Version
(CVLT-C) and Rey Complex Figure Test and Recognition Trial (RCFT).
Data for 73 children with CM1 were analyzed (41 males and 32 females;
mean age = 11.23 ± 3.43 years).
Results: 49.3% of the sample received previous DS (n=36). T-tests comparing immediate, delayed, and recognition verbal and visual memory
performance between individuals with and without previous DS revealed
no significant differences in memory performance (p > .05). Group comparisons indicated low average to average performance across memory
tasks in both groups. Follow-up bivariate linear regression analyses with
the total sample revealed that DS status did not significantly predict
present verbal or visual memory performance (p > .05).
Conclusions: Individuals with CM1 post-DS displayed no difference in
memory functioning compared to those who did not have surgery. The
current data indicates that DS has little impact on verbal and visual
memory. Future prospective studies will be needed to further support
this preliminary finding. This study represents a first attempt to document cognitive sequelae of DS. Overall, surgical intervention appears
not to adversely impact memory functioning.

G.J. GERNER, M.C. GAGE, A.E. PRITCHARD, V. BURTON &
M. MAHONE. Contributions of Executive Function to Math
Achievement in Children Born Preterm and Children Born at
Term with ADHD.
Objective: Preterm birth is a risk factor for lower math achievement,
as is diagnosis of ADHD without history of preterm birth. Underlying
problems with executive functions (EF) have been proposed as a contributing factor; however, there is limited information as to whether
there are different patterns of executive dysfunction in these two clinical
populations that contribute to lower math achievement. The purpose of
this preliminary study was to further examine whether different aspects
of executive dysfunction underlie lower math achievement in these two
clinical populations.
Participants and Methods: A retrospective analysis of clinical data was
performed, including children born preterm (<37 weeks gestation; N =
117) and at term (≥ 37 weeks gestation) with diagnoses of ADHD (N
= 379). Group differences in math achievement were examined. After
controlling for sex, the relationship between parent reports of executive
dysfunction (BRIEF subscales) and math achievement (WJ-III Math
Calculation or WIAT-II Numerical Operations) was examined using
multiple linear regression for each clinical group.

118
Results: There were no differences in math achievement between clinical groups. The BRIEF did not predict math achievement in preterm
children (F (9, 107) = 1.219, p = 0.291); however, it did predict lower
math achievement in children born at term who were diagnosed with
ADHD (F (9, 369) = 2.802, p<0.01). Specifically, the BRIEF Shift and
Organization of Materials scales were the only significant predictors of
math achievement.
Conclusions: Difficulties with mental flexibility, attentional shifting,
and organization of academic materials in term born children with diagnoses of ADHD may contribute to lower math achievement. Conversely, math achievement difficulties in children born preterm may be
a function of non-executive functional deficits. Further investigation of
the cognitive processes underlying lower math achievement in these two
clinical groups is warranted.

L. GROSS, L. GLASS, P.K. GOH & S.N. MATTSON. Specificity
of Memory Deficits in Children and Adolescents with Prenatal
Alcohol Exposure.
Objective: Although children with histories of prenatal alcohol exposure demonstrate memory impairments across multiple domains, the
specificity of these deficits is not known.
Participants and Methods: Memory was assessed using the NEPSY-II
[Memory for Designs (MD), Narrative Memory (NM), Memory for Faces
(MF), and Memory for Names (MN)]. Three groups were tested: individuals with prenatal alcohol exposure (AE; n= 150), non-exposed individuals with other clinical behavioral conditions (B-CON; n=111), and
typically developing controls (T-CON; n=172). A repeated-measures
MANCOVA was conducted [Memory × Group × Age Group (Child, 5-7y;
Adolescent, 10-16y)] with sex and ethnicity as covariates.
Results: The Group × Memory × Age Group and Age Group × Memory interactions and all main effects were significant (ps<.05). Group
differences were similar at both ages for MF and MN (T-CON>B-CON,
AE). Profiles varied by age and group for NM and MD; AE and B-CON
groups differed on MD (both ages) and NM (Adolescents). Within-group
age differences (Adolescent>Child) were present on MF in the AE group
and on NM, MF, and MN in the B-CON group. Profiles of performance
across subtests also varied by group (AE: NM,MF>MN>MD; B-CON:
NM,MF>MN; T-CON: NM>MF>MD).
Conclusions: Compared to typical controls, alcohol-exposed children
demonstrated memory impairments across domains, though deficits
were attenuated when compared to a clinical control sample. AE and
B-CON groups only differed on measures of visuospatial and verbal
memory, suggesting specific weaknesses in the AE population. Within
AE, narrative and facial memory may be relative strengths. Memory
performance was generally consistent across age in the AE group, suggesting no improvement. These results present a profile of memory
performance for individuals with prenatal alcohol exposure that is consistent across age, but differs by domain tested and comparison group.

A. HEITZER, J. PIERCY, B. PETERS & S. RAZ. School Readiness
and Perinatal Risk in Preschoolers Born Preterm.
Objective: A body of literature supports an association between preterm
birth and academic achievement deficits upon school entry. However,
less is known about factors affecting school readiness in preterm-born
children. The objective of the current investigation was to examine the
associations between perinatal risk factors and school readiness in preschoolers born preterm.

Participants and Methods: One hundred and twelve preterm (<34
weeks gestation) preschoolers (3-4 years) participated in the study (50
females and 62 males). We excluded cases with congenital anomalies,
moderate to severe intracranial hemorrhage, cerebral palsy, and prenatal substance exposure. School readiness was evaluated using a brief
battery of eight subtests from the WPPSI-III, CELF-P2, WJ-III and
PDMS-2. The eight tasks assessed discrete intellectual, language, mathematics, and visuo-motor skills, respectively.
Results: Multivariate analyses of covariance with birth weight, antenatal growth rate, summary scores of ante-, peri-, and neonatal complications, as well as sex, were our predictors of interest. Socioeconomic
status was added as a covariate. We found that exposure to a greater
number of antenatal complications was associated with lower scores on
the linear combination of the WPPSI-III Block Design and Information
subtests (F[2, 97] = 4.07, p = .02) as well as the linear combination
of the CELF-P2 Word Structure, Concepts and Following Directions,
and Recalling Sentences subtests (F[3, 89] = 2.80, p = .045). Lower
birth weight was associated with poorer performance on Visuomotor
Integration (F[1, 95] = 4.39, p = .039). Male sex was associated with
lower scores on the linear combination of the WPPSI-III Block Design
and Information subtests (F[2, 97] = 4.98, p = .009).
Conclusions: Degree of antenatal risk, birthweight, and sex are linked
to neuropsychological development and school readiness in the early
preschool years. These associations were identified with a brief battery
of neuropsychological tasks.

P.A. KULESZ, A.L. WARE, J.S. ORKISZ, V.J. WILLIAMS,
M. DENNIS & J.M. FLETCHER. The Longitudinal Effects of
Shunt Treatment Predict Alterations in the Neural Correlates of
the Posterior but not Anterior Attention Network in Spina Bifida
Myelomeningocele.
Objective: Deteriorating effects of hydrocephalus on grey and white
matter tissue, considered as secondary insults to the brain, have important implications for attention function in individuals with spina
bifida myelomeningocele (SBM). Though the literature discusses neural
and functional deficits in the attention networks (AN) subsequent to
hydrocephalus, few studies have looked at the effects of shunt treatment
for hydrocephalus on the neural and functional correlates of AN. The
current study focuses on investigating the longitudinal effects of the
shunt treatment on neural correlates and functional outcomes associated
with the anterior and posterior AN.
Participants and Methods: Probabilistic diffusion tractography and
volumetric quantification of tectal, superior parietal, dorsolateral prefrontal, and anterior cingulate cortical regions were performed on 163
individuals with histories of shunt-treated SBM with assessments of posterior (covert orienting) and anterior (conflict resolution) AN functions.
Multiple regression analyses were performed to examine the effects of
shunt treatment on the neural and functional correlates of the anterior
and posterior AN.
Results: Age of initial shunt operation was predictive of integrity of the
parietal but not the frontal tectocortical white matter (WM) pathways.
Youth who underwent initial shunt operations at an older age had higher
FA values and lower RD values in the posterior parietal pathways. A
greater number of shunt revisions was predictive of AD values in the
posterior and anterior tectocortical WM pathways, and the superior parietal cortex volume. Shunt treatment was not predictive of the functional
outcomes associated with anterior and posterior AN.
Conclusions: The findings suggest greater neuroanatomical disruption
of the posterior AN subsequent to hydrocephalus treatment relative to
the anterior AN, suggesting neuroanatomical dissociation between the
anterior and posterior AN in SBM.

A. LUCCHETTI, C. GREEN & T. BROWN. Neuropsychological
Profiles in Parry Romberg Syndrome: A Case Series.
Objective: Parry Romberg Syndrome (PRS) is a rare neurocutaneous
disorder characterized by degeneration of the tissues between the skin,
typically on one side of the face (progressive hemifacial atrophy). Incidence rates are unknown, but some have suggested 1 in 700,000
(Castro-Govea et al., 2012). Onset is typically between 5 and 15 years
of age and progresses for 2 to 10 years (Gulati et al., 2006). It occurs
more commonly in females. Associated neurologic features include trigeminal neuralgia, migraine, epilepsy, brain lesions on CT and MRI,
and changes in the eyes, skin, teeth, and hair (Stone, 2003). Cognitive
outcomes are generally unknown given the rarity of the syndrome. This
is a case series of two adolescents with PRS to help better understand
their neuropsychological profiles.
Participants and Methods: Participants included a 15-year, 7-monthold male and 14-year, 11-month-old female with PRS. Both presented
for comprehensive neuropsychological assessment at a major Midwestern medical institution as part of comprehensive multispecialty medical
evaluations.
Results: Similarities between their neuropsychological profiles include
broadly intact verbal and nonverbal reasoning, with relatively stronger
nonverbal abilities, average academic skills, and intact sustained attention. Weaknesses included variable executive functioning and variable
language skills. The child without epilepsy demonstrated better working
memory, processing speed, and fine motor dexterity, while the child with
comorbid epilepsy demonstrated better verbal memory abilities and
milder executive weaknesses. Both profiles were negative for significant
mood concerns.
Conclusions: This case series provides preliminary information about
the neurocognitive functioning of adolescents with this rare syndrome.
Future directions should include more robust neurocognitive data to
understand profiles in adolescents with PRS with and without epilepsy,
as well as to track disease progression with relation to neurocognitive
outcomes.

M. MENTZER, F. EICHLER & A.K. MORGAN. Case Study of
Krabbe Disease Post-Bone Marrow Transplant.
Objective: Krabbe disease (globoid cell leukodystrophy) is a rare neurological disorder characterized by a mutation that impairs the development of the enzyme glucocerebrosidase (GALC), which is involved
in the production and maintenance of myelin throughout the nervous
system. This mutation causes inhibition of GALC activity, leading to
neuromuscular and cognitive decline. The only effective treatment is
bone marrow transplant (BMT), associated with halting progression
of the disease. Cognitive outcomes have not been reported. We report
clinical data of a patient who underwent BMT for Krabbe with neurological and cognitive outcomes.
Participants and Methods: Patient is a 9-year old boy with Krabbe
disease who initially presented at 7-years with gross motor difficulties.
Corticospinal tract abnormality and sensory and motor demyelinating
neuropathy were found. Genetic testing revealed 2 variants of the GALC
gene. He underwent BMT. He has had regular neurological evaluations
and 3 neuropsychological evaluations: 3 months pre-BMT and 15- and
27-months post-BMT. Cognitive skills ranged from average to superior
pre-BMT.
Results: Post-BMT the patient had graft vs host disease, renal impairment, optic disc edema and bilateral cataracts. Neuropathy was present
but improved. Myelin in the corticospinal tract was stable. Slight worsening of periventricular white matter involvement was noted. Fifteen

119
months post-BMT, cognitive abilities were stable with a mild decline in
processing speed. Twenty-seven months post-BMT, cognitive abilities
remained stable and in some instances improved, including processing
speed.
Conclusions: This study provides an understanding of the cognitive
effects of juvenile-onset Krabbe disease and the outcome following bone
marrow transplant. Variables that may play a role include time between
symptom onset and BMT, forms of genetic mutation and GALC activity.

A. MITTAL, V.P. CULOTTA & M. BLACKWELL. Implications of
Congenital Heart Defect on Neurocognitive Development: Case
Study of Ebstein’s Anomaly.
Objective: This case study examined neurocognitive features associated
with a rare congenital heart defect, Ebstein’s Anomaly (EA). EA is
marked by tricuspid malformation and subsequent regurgitation. The
defect occurs in 1 of 20,000 births. Both genetic and environmental
factors are implicated. Depending on severity, symptoms may range
from mild to life-threatening. Severe presentations require surgical intervention. EA results in cyanosis and occasionally chronic hypoxia.
Medications to prevent heart failure may be ototoxic.
Participants and Methods: A 7-year, 3-month old female with EA
detected in utero was seen for neuropsychological assessment. This patient required multiple surgical corrections, intubation and ventilation,
ototoxic medications, and multiple pacemaker placements.
Results: Assessment revealed a Major Neurocognitive Disorder secondary to Hypoxia aggravated by ototoxic medications. Sensorineural
hearing loss and vocal impairment were present. Her neuropsychological
profile was marked by Borderline Intellectual functioning with verbal cognition more significantly impacted. Weaknesses were evident
in bilateral fine motor speed, bilateral gross motor strength, reading
comprehension, written expression, verbal confrontation naming, receptive and expressive language skills. Relative strengths were apparent in
processing speed, rapid naming, semantic fluency and aspects of verbal
memory. Behavioral checklists reflected a positive, well-behaved and
social youngster.
Conclusions: Congenital heart defects represent a significant neurocognitive risk factor for children. This case study examined a 7-year,
3-month old youngster with EA marked by chronic hypoxia, intubation,
multiple surgical corrections, and ototoxicity associated with medications. Her neurocognitive profile revealed marked weakness in aspects
of intellectual, academic, and cognitive-linguistic skills. This case study
illustrates the neurocognitive risks of heart malformations and the value
of early assessment.

& J.R. LOWE. Parenting Quality and Neurocognitive Outcomes in
Children born Term and Preterm.
Objective: Preterm children are at risk for delayed cognitive, language, and self-regulation development compared with term children.
Responsive and non-controlling parenting fosters the development of
child self-regulation and improves cognitive/behavioral outcomes. We
investigated the association between parenting quality, self-regulation
and neurocognitive outcomes in preterm compared to full term children.
Participants and Methods: A cross-sectional study of 50 term and 49
preterm children (18-24 months) was conducted. Parental and child
behavior were assessed during 5 minutes of videotaped play using the
Dyadic Parent-child Coding System (DPICS) that measures parent’s
verbal and physical behaviors including commands, questions, praise,
neutral/negative talk, reflective statements, behavioral descriptions, and
touch. A composite score was created with positive and negative parent

120
quality indices. The child’s compliance with parental commands was
correlated to measures of self-regulation and Bayley-III scores. Self-regulation was measured using the A not B test of object permanence and
snack delay test of impulsivity.
Results: Mothers of preterm children used more commands (p=0.001)
and had more negative talk (p=0.04) than term mothers. Increased
use of unlabeled praise positively correlated with cognitive scores on
Bayley-III (p=0.05). For term children, increased direct commands
inversely correlated to language scores (p<0.001) while increased descriptive questions and reflective statements positively correlated to language scores (p<0.02). For both groups, increased use of information
questions correlated to better snack delay scores (p<0.05). When groups
were combined, the positive parent quality index score correlated with
increased language scores and the negative parent quality index score
correlated with decreased language scores (p<0.05).
Conclusions: We found a positive correlation between parenting quality
and neurobehavioral outcomes. This has implications for early childhood intervention and parental education.

T. NORRIS, C.H. SALAMA, B. SLOMINE, S. SUSKAUER &
C.F. SALORIO. Improvements in Functional Independence
During Inpatient Rehabilitation for Children with Brain Tumors.
Objective: After a brain tumor resection, some children exhibit functional declines that may warrant inpatient rehabilitation. This study examines functioning in the domains of self-care, mobility, and cognition
among children admitted to inpatient rehabilitation after brain tumor
resection. It was hypothesized functioning would improve from admission to discharge and outcomes would differ based on tumor location
and whether the patient received oncology treatment (chemotherapy
and/or radiation) during rehabilitation.
Participants and Methods: Participants were 43 patients (3-21 years)
admitted to inpatient rehabilitation between 2003-2015 after brain
tumor resection (25 males; M age=9.8 years). Mean length of stay was
35.28 days (range=5-116). Tumor location was more commonly infratentorial (69.8% vs 30.2% supratentorial). 23.3% received oncology
treatment during rehabilitation. The Functional Independence Measure
for Children (WeeFIM) Developmental Functional Quotient (DFQ) was
used to measure functional independence across domains (self-care,
mobility, and cognition).
Results: Paired t-tests indicated improvements in WeeFIM DFQ
scores from admission to discharge (Total, Self-Care, Mobility, Cognition=p<.001). One-way ANOVAs were conducted to determine if
WeeFIM DFQ scores at admission and discharge differed based on tumor
location or oncology treatment. One-way ANOVAs were also conducted
to determine if change in WeeFIM DFQ scores from admission to discharge differed based on these factors. No significant differences in
functioning based on tumor location or oncology treatment were found.
Conclusions: Children who have undergone surgical resection for a
brain tumor demonstrate improvements in functioning during inpatient
rehabilitation. Functional independence did not differ based on tumor
location or whether oncology treatment was received during rehabilitation. Further research with a larger sample size is needed to more fully
explore the relationship between tumor/treatment characteristics and
functional outcome.

K. ODDI, A.C. GROSS & C.J. BOYS. Neurocognitive Development
Among Children Diagnosed with Methylmalonic Aciduria (MMA).
Objective: Since 1965, newborns in Minnesota have been screened for
rare disorders that, if untreated, can cause serious illness or death. This
study examined the neurocognitive functioning of children diagnosed
with Methylmalonic Aciduria (MMA) via newborn screening. MMA is

a rare (about 1 in 100,000 newborns) metabolic disorder presenting
due to deficiency of mitochrondial enzyme MCM resulting in metabolic
acidosis causing neurodegeneration of the basal ganglia and renal failure. After the neonatal period, infants with MMA demonstrate variable
clinical manifestations. Research has shown that children with organic
acidurias demonstrate failure to thrive and developmental delays, but
a specific trajectory has not been described.
Participants and Methods: This study evaluated the neurocognitive
development of 6 children (4 male) with MMA seen long-term in a metabolic follow-up clinic. There are 9 total MMA patients in MN. Children
were administered age-appropriate measures of intellectual functioning
at approximately 5 years of age.
Results: At 5 years of age, mean scores on a measure of intellectual
functioning fell in the impaired range. The average FSIQ = 58 (range
52-69). Two of the children followed long-term remained in the impaired range beyond 10 years of age. One child was not testable due to
impairments at 5 years.
Conclusions: Despite variable clinical presentation in the newborn
phase, results suggest that children with MMA demonstrate impaired
neurocognitive abilities at the age of 5 years. This impaired functioning
is despite early identification and ongoing treatment. Findings have
implications for early assessment and intervention with children with
MMA. The longitudinal trajectory can also assist healthcare providers in
presenting accurate long-term expectations to parents following positive
newborn screen findings.

B. PETERS, A. HEITZER, J. PIERCY & S. RAZ. Perinatal Risk and
Motor Abilities in Preterm-Born Preschoolers.
Objective: The sequelae of preterm birth may include motor deficits
even in children without cerebral palsy (CP), yet little is known about
the perinatal antecedents of these adverse functional changes. In this
investigation, we wished to examine the unique influence of degree of
gestational immaturity and sex on motor development at preschool age,
in the context of other early risk factors.
Participants and Methods: One hundred and one (41 boys, 60 girls)
preterm-born (<34 weeks) preschoolers participated in this study. Children with CP, severe intracranial hemorrhage, and uncorrected sensory
deficits were excluded. Motor functioning was evaluated, at 44.32 ± 3.39
months, with the Peabody Developmental Motor Scales-2 (PDMS-2) as
well as the Manual Motor Sequences, Imitating Hand Positions, Visuomotor Precision, and Design Copying subtests from a developmental
neuropsychological battery (NEPSY-II).
Results: We used simultaneous multiple regression with gestational
age and sex as predictors of interest. Adjusted age, SES, neonatal complications, and intrauterine growth rate were covariates. Gestational
age was associated with performance on PDMS-II gross motor (Object
Manipulation; p < .05) and fine motor (Visual-Motor Integration; p <
.05) subtests: a greater degree of immaturity was linked to poorer performance. Female advantage was observed on the PDMS-2 Total (p <
.05), and Fine (p < .05) Motor, scales. Girls outperformed boys on two
PDMS-2 subtests, Grasping (p < .01) and Locomotion (p < .01) and
on four NEPSY-II subtests: Design Copying (p < .01), Imitating Hand
Positions (p < .05), Manual Motor Sequences (p < .05), and Visuomotor
Precision (p < .05).
Conclusions: Among preterm preschoolers, degree of immaturity was
associated with motor outcome despite the restricted gestational age
range of our sample. Increased immaturity was linked to decline in
both fine and gross motor performance, particularly on tasks requiring
eye-hand coordination. Female sex provided both gross and fine motor
advantage.

J.E. SCHREIBER, H.M. CONKLIN, K. CLARK, J. HANKINS,
W. WANG & K. HELTON. Cognitive and Academic Functioning
After Initiation of Hydroxyurea in Pediatric Patients with Sickle
Cell Disease.
Objective: Hydroxyurea therapy (HU) aims to prevent vaso-occlusion,
reduce anemia severity, and decrease pain and fatigue in patients with
sickle cell disease (SCD). Consequently, cognitive functioning may improve with HU. The present study examined cognitive and academic
functioning before and after HU initiation in pediatric patients with
SCD.
Participants and Methods: Participants comprised 15 SCD patients
who initiated HU [6 male; mean age: 12.2 years, SD=3.4] and five comparison SCD patients who did not initiate HU [3 male; mean age: 9.2
years, SD=2.2]. Participants completed assessments prior to initiation
(baseline) and again one year later. Treated participants achieved maximum tolerated dose of HU prior to the one year follow up assessment.
Results: At baseline, treated patients demonstrated low average
Wechsler IQ (FSIQ) scores (M=80.0, SD=13.8) and impaired to low
average Woodcock-Johnson-III (WJ-III) academic achievement scores
(range: 78.0-85.6). After one year of HU, both FSIQ scores (M=83.1,
SD=14.0, p=.04) and Processing Speed Index scores significantly improved (M=87.9 changed to M=92.4, p=.03). Treated participants also
demonstrated improved WJ-III Passage Comprehension scores (M=78.0
changed to M=81.6, p=.04). Non-treated participants demonstrated
average FSIQ scores (M=95.0, SD=21.9) and low average to average
WJ-III academic achievement scores (range: 84.0-91.6) at baseline.
Non-treated participants did not demonstrate significant change on
any Wechsler index scores between baseline and follow up testing but
demonstrated significant decline on the WJ-III Letter-Word reading test
(M=92.6 changed to M=88.2, p=.02).
Conclusions: Treatment with HU appears to provide benefit to overall
cognitive functioning, processing speed, and reading comprehension
in SCD patients. Findings highlight the need for close monitoring of
cognitive functioning in SCD patients and the implementation of appropriate interventions.

D. FRIM. Verbal and Visual Memory Performance in a Cohort of
Children with Chiari Malformation Type 1.
Objective: Chiari malformation type I (CM1) involves herniation of the
cerebellar through the foramen magnum (deSouza, Zador, and Frim,
2011). Increasing research has been directed at investigating the role of
the cerebellum in cognition (see review, Koziol and colleagues, 2014).
At present, only case studies and small cohorts have been presented
examining the potential cognitive sequelae of this unique malformation.
Thus the present study attempted to identify the memory profile in the
largest cohort of children with CM1.
Participants and Methods: 73 children, mean age of 11 (range 6 - 17
years) consecutively recruited at a university based surgery clinic completed a verbal learning and memory test [California Verbal Learning
Test-Children’s Version (CVLT-C)] and an incidental visual memory
test [Rey Complex Figure Test and Recognition Trial (RCFT)]. Means,
percentages and T tests were calculated using SPSS-22.
Results: Participants displayed mildly impaired visual learning (T=40.1
(11.1)) and delayed free recall (T=38.9 (10.9)) yet intact recognition
(T=46.8 (12.6)). In contrast, immediate verbal learning (T=51.5
(11.1)), delayed verbal free recall (T=50.7 (11.5)) and verbal recognition (T=52.9 (9.9)) were in the average range. T-tests between verbal
and visual memory trials revealed significantly poorer performance on
visual memory tasks (Immediate memory T (72) = -7.57, p<.001; Delayed memory T (72) = -8.09, p<.001; Recognition memory T (72) =
-3.62, p<.001).
Conclusions: Children with CM1 displayed visual retrieval deficits, yet
intact verbal learning and memory processing. This is consistent with

121
prior research suggesting a role of the cerebellum in visual attention,
memory and planning, which may underlie the noted deficits.

Objective: Monogenic diabetes (MD) is a category of rare (approximately 1 in 90,000-160,000) diabetic disorders that includes individuals with congenital/early onset diabetes un-related to insulin insufficiency (i.e., not type I or II). Mutations in the 20+ genes linked to
MD produce a range of phenotypic presentations and disease severity,
with associated neurological complications that can include epilepsy,
developmental delay, and brain malformations. Present reports of the
neuropsychological characteristics within MD populations are limited
and indicate highly heterogeneous profiles, although few papers have
evaluated patterns of cognitive strengths and weaknesses categorized by
specific mutation. Functional changes in the ATP-sensitive potassium
(KATP) channel are among the most common causes of MD. The objective of this case series is to better understand the neuropsychological
profiles of two mutations in the KCNJ11 KATP channel gene.
Participants and Methods: R201H (N=4) and R201C (N=2). Patients
completed thorough neuropsychological evaluations.
Results: Patients with R201H demonstrated normative weaknesses in
verbal list learning, visual-spatial production/learning, and behavioral
executive skills that were consistent across all 4 individuals. Difficulties
with visual-motor integration and fine motor skills were also found in
the adolescent and adult individuals with R201H. The neuropsychological profile for the individuals with R201C included borderline to
impaired performance in perceptual reasoning, math, written language,
set-shifting, inhibition, visual motor integration, and visual-spatial production/learning. Below average verbal list learning skills was also consistent across both individuals.
Conclusions: In sum, although both mutations constitute similar
changes in primary protein structure, non-trivial differences in neuropsychological profiles appear to be present. Additionally, assessment of
changes in skill development over time may be particularly important
in this population.

Parent Reported Temperament in Young Children with
Neurofibromatosis type 1.
Objective: Research suggests that young children with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) have difficulties with learning, attention, and executive
functioning; however, research examining temperament and personality
in young children with NF1 is more sparse. Evidence suggests that
school-aged children with NF1 are at risk for emotional and social difficulties. Given temperament may play an important role in psychosocial
functioning in later childhood, this study aims to examine whether a
significant difference exists in the temperament of young children with
NF1 compared to a contrast group of children without NF1.
Participants and Methods: Parents of 57 children with NF1 (33 males,
24 females) and parents of 48 unaffected children (30 males, 18 females) ages 3 to 7 years completed the Children’s Behavior Questionnaire (CBQ) in order to assess temperament characteristics.
Results: Children with NF1 were rated significantly higher than the
contrast group in the Extraversion scale [t(104) = 3.126, p = .003] of
the CBQ. Within this scale, children with NF1 were rated significantly
higher in Activity [t(104) = 2.762, p = .005] and Impulsivity [t(104)
= 2.878, p = .004]. Children with NF1 were rated significantly lower
than the contrast group in the Effortful Control scale [t(104) = -3.224,

122
p = .001]. Within this scale, children with NF1 were rated significantly
lower on Attentional Focusing [t(104) = -4.315, p < .001] and Inhibitory Control [t(104) = -3.157, p = .002] compared to the contrast
group. No gender or age differences in ratings were evident on any
scale for either group.
Conclusions: These findings suggest that the temperament profile of
young children with NF1 differ from that of unaffected children. Based
on parental report, young children with NF1 tend to be less focused
and more impulsive than their peers. These findings may be useful in
detecting early and subtle vulnerabilities that place children at risk for
later psychosocial difficulties.

M.L. LIPTON. Soccer Heading during Games is Associated with
Neuropsychological Function in Amateur Players.
Objective: The goal of the present study was to examine the relationship between heading, thought to be a repetitive sub-concussive event
sustained during normal soccer play, and neuropsychological function
in amateur adult soccer players.
Participants and Methods: One hundred ninety-three amateur soccer players completed a questionnaire to ascertain heading exposure
during the prior 12 mos. CogState was used to assess neuropsychological
function across multiple domains. Due to a non-normal distribution of
heading data, we divided participants into quartiles based on heading exposure and then dichotomized into two groups: High Heading
(HH=4th quartile) and Low Heading (LH=1st–3rd quartile). Linear
regression was used to examine the relationship between heading group
and neuropsychological function, covarying for lifetime concussion history, age, gender, education, and race. Heading during games or practice
was examined separately.
Results: Participants had an average age of 27 yrs (sd=8.1) and 16 yrs
of education (sd=2.5). Participants headed the ball a median of 642
times/yr (games=304 times/yr, practice=278 times/yr). HH participants
headed the ball at least 1565 times/yr . Participants with HH in games
had poorer performance on tests of verbal learning (p<.001) and verbal
memory (p=.005) compared to LH participants. Sixty-nine (36%) participants reported a history of concussion (HH n=15, LH n=54). Lifetime concussion history was not related to neuropsychological function
and did not modify the association of heading and cognition. Heading
exposure during practice was not related to neuropsychological function.
Conclusions: Soccer players in the top quartile of heading exposure
during soccer games had poorer performance on tests of verbal learning
and delayed verbal memory relative to players who headed less. Heading
predicted neuropsychological function independent of concussion in our
sample, suggesting that repetitive low level trauma during soccer games
is associated with cognitive impairment in amateur soccer players.

J. LICHTENSTEIN & D. LAZAR. Prevalence Rates of Concussion
in Ultimate Frisbee: Preliminary Findings of the Concussion in
Ultimate Frisbee Survey (CUFS).
Objective: This study aimed to determine prevalence rates of concussion in the sport of Ultimate Frisbee. When played at a high level,
Ultimate poses a contact risk. While prior estimates have been made,
sample sizes were very small; the frequency of concussion in this sport,
therefore, is unknown. We hypothesized that Ultimate players would

endorse concussion rates similar to those seen in sports that share its
characteristics, such as soccer and basketball.
Participants and Methods: An anonymous survey was distributed to
Ultimate players at all levels of play, from recreational to professional.
Data was returned for 580 participants of approximately 2500 surveyed,
for a return rate of 23.2%. The sample consisted predominantly of
males in their mid-twenties (69.7% male; MAge = 26.2 years, SDAge
= 5.9; range 18-54). Frequency analyses were conducted to determine
prevalence rates, and rate of concussions per 10,000 athletic exposures
was also calculated.
Results: Frequency analyses indicated that 28.2% of participants had
experienced at least one concussion playing Ultimate, while 21.5% of
respondents who played Ultimate in college experienced at least one
concussion at that level of play. Participants identified similar rates of
injury at the college and club levels (34.2% vs. 43.5%). When adjusted
for athletic exposures, the rate of concussions in college Ultimate players
was 3.2 per 10,000 (for men and women combined). This is comparable
to many other NCAA sports, including men’s soccer, basketball, and
lacrosse.
Conclusions: The risk of head injury in Ultimate has been grossly
underestimated and medical resources provided to teams are currently
lacking. The results of this survey demonstrate a high rate of concussions
in Ultimate and the need for greater support from institutions, especially
at the college level, given the rapid growth of the sport. This support may
include the need for baseline and post-injury neurocognitive testing, in
which neuropsychologists can play a substantial role.

The Effects of a Yoga and Mindfulness Intervention on Executive
Functioning in Traumatic Brain Injury.
Objective: Individuals who have sustained a traumatic brain injury
(TBI) often experience subsequent difficulties in the physiological, psychological, and cognitive domains. In terms of the latter, such individuals are particularly vulnerable to executive functioning impairments,
which can interfere with occupational, social, and emotional functioning. Unfortunately, limited treatments are available that target longterm executive functioning weakness in individuals with TBI. As such,
this pilot study examined the effect of a yoga and mindfulness-based intervention on executive functioning skills in adults with a history of TBI.
Participants and Methods: A pre-post study design was utilized to
examine the effect of an 8-week yoga and mindfulness program on the
executive functions in adults who have experienced mild or moderate
TBI. Participants included 7 male and 5 female adults with a mean
age of 52 years. The Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function
– Adult (BRIEF-A) was completed as a measure of executive functions
pre and post intervention.
Results: A paired samples t-test was conducted to compare executive
functioning skills pre and post intervention. Results indicated a significant improvement on the Inhibition scale following the intervention
program (M=5.90, SD=7.25); t(10)=2.70, p = .022. Further, Cohen’s
effect size value (d = 0.81) suggested a high practical significance.
Conclusions: Following an 8-week yoga and mindfulness intervention
program, adults with TBI histories indicated significant improvements
in their ability to control their actions and be less impulsive in their decision-making. Despite the small sample size of this study, these findings
are encouraging as they suggest the potential utility of an alternative
method of intervention that may improve the daily functioning of individuals recovering from TBI.

C.E. GAUDET, B.C. KAVANAUGH, L.D. HAISLEY, J. DUPONTFRECHETTE, P. TELLOCK, I. MAHER, K. BENSON &
K.A. HOLLER. The Role of Cultural Bias in the Continuous
Performance Test Second Edition (CPT-II) in a Pediatric Sample.
Objective: Cultural bias (CB) can significantly influence neuropsychological evaluation results, potentially leading to inaccurate or skewed
conclusions regarding brain-behavior relationships. This study examined the influence of cultural bias on the Continuous Performance Test
(CPT-II) within a children’s psychiatric inpatient setting.
Participants and Methods: A medical chart review was conducted for
77 children aged 6-12 years with at least one psychiatric disorder who
completed the CPT-II during a children’s psychiatric inpatient program
hospitalization from 2010-2014. CB risk was assessed via each child’s
minority status (white/non-white), insurance status (public/private),
and school ranking (high/low state ranking). A total CB risk score (0-3)
was calculated for each child based on the sum of CB risk factors. ADHD
diagnosis status was determined from the chart review.
Results: On the CPT-II, both ISI Change measures (Hit RT & Hit SE)
were correlated with the CB risk factor total score. ANOVAs found group
differences in both ISI Change measures among those with 0, 1, 2, and
3 CB risk factors. A chi-square test was significant for the relationship
between CB risk factors and ADHD diagnosis, with 88% of patients
that met the criteria for 3 risk factors receiving an ADHD diagnosis.
An ADHD diagnosis was also found to be significantly correlated with
both ISI Change measures.
Conclusions: Results indicate that the CPT-II’s ISI Change measures
and ADHD diagnoses are susceptible to CB risk factors. Such CB risk
factors may be exerting influence on CPT-II test performance and the
subsequent likelihood of receiving an ADHD diagnosis in pediatric populations. Because the CPT-II is a widely used component of neuropsychological assessments in determining the presence of ADHD, it is recommended that CPT-II interpretations, particularly those related to ISI
measures, are considered in the context of CB risk in pediatric samples.

D. POTVIN, A.R. GIOIA, K.S. WALSH & K.K. HARDY. Traditional
versus Computerized Assessment of Executive Dysfunction in
Preschoolers within the Pediatric Oncology Population.
Objective: The nature of executive functioning deficits in preschoolers
with CNS-impacting cancer is poorly understood, in part because of
limited sensitivity of traditional assessment measures.
Participants and Methods: We examined the sensitivity of multiple
measures of attention and executive function to impairment in a sample
of young children with cancer. This study included 22 children (11
brain tumor (BT), 11 Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL)) between
the ages of 4 and 7 years (M=5.2, SD=2.7), with all children at least
one year post-diagnosis (age at diagnosis M=2.7, SD=1.3; years since
diagnosis M=3.0, SD=1.4).
Results: Neither group (BT and ALL) demonstrated significant deficits on traditional, paper and pencil measures of processing speed
(WPPSI-IV: Symbol Search: BT M=9.9; ALL M =10.8) or working
memory (NEPSY-II: Sentence Repetition: BT M=10.6, ALL M=9.8;
CMS: Numbers BT M=8.6, ALL M=9.4). Similarly, no deficits were
noted on parent report of attention (CBCL: Attention Problems: BT
M=55.2, ALL M=52.5) or executive functioning (BRIEF-P: EMI BT
M=59.4, ALL M=51.8; ISCI BT M=54.6, ALL M=49.3). In contrast,
computerized measures of processing speed (CogState Standard Score:
Detection BT M=85.1, ALL M=101.2) and visual attention (CogState
Standard Score: Identification BT M= 86.5, ALL M=97.0) were sensitive
to dysfunction, though only for the brain tumor group. Correlations

123
between traditional and computerized assessment ranges from R=.031
to R=.561, with the strongest correlation between traditional and computerized measures of processing speed.
Conclusions: Our pilot results indicate that computerized measures
may be more sensitive to emerging higher-order cognitive deficits exhibited by young children with CNS-impacting cancer than traditional,
paper-and-pencil or parent report measures. Early identification of cognitive difficulties may allow for early intervention to address attention
problems and, possibly, ameliorate later academic and social difficulties.

Uniquely Contributes to Performance on the MoCA in Deep Brain
Stimulation Surgery Candidates with Parkinson’s Disease.
Objective: To examine the contribution of executive dysfunction and
depression on scores from the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA),
the most commonly used measure for diagnosis and surgical decision
making for patients with Parkinson’s disease (PD) who are candidates
for Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) surgery.
Participants and Methods: Data from 54 patients with PD who were
candidates for DBS were examined. An Executive Composite score was
created by averaging T-scores from 4 measures of executive functioning
(Wisconsin Card Sorting Test Perseverative Errors, Letter Fluency, Trail
Making Test B, and Stroop Color-Word Test Interference). Depression was measured using the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II). A
stepwise multiple linear regression analysis was used to predict MoCA
scores based on individuals’ executive functioning and depression scores.
Results: MoCA scores were negatively correlated with BDI-II scores
(-.514; p<.001) and positively correlated with the Executive Composite
score (.645; p<.001). BDI-II scores were not significantly correlated with
the Executive Composite score (-.215; ns). The model contained two
predictors and was reached in two steps without any variables removed.
The model was statistically significant F (2, 51) = 32.897, p<.001,
and accounted for approximately 56% of the variance in MoCA scores
(R2 = .563; adjusted R2 = .546). The Executive Composite Score and
BDI-II each uniquely accounted for approximately 30% and 15% of the
variance in MoCA scores, respectively.
Conclusions: Depression and executive dysfunction independently
contribute to MoCA performance in individuals with PD. As might be
expected, stronger executive abilities and less depression are associated
with better performance on the MoCA. Of note, depression and executive functioning should be considered independently when interpreting
MoCA scores and determining candidacy for DBS surgery.

Participants and Methods: Data from 209 patients with PD who were
candidates for DBS surgery were examined. Depression was measured
using either the Geriatric Depression Scale or Beck Depression Inventory-II. Depression was categorized into three severity classifications
based on well-established cut-offs from the literature: (1) normal/minimal (n=135), (2) mild/moderate (n=61), and (3) severe (n=13). An

124
Executive Composite score was created by averaging T-scores from 4
neuropsychological measures of executive functioning: Wisconsin Card
Sorting Test Perseverative Errors, Letter Fluency, Trail Making Test
B, and Stroop Color-Word Test Interference. A Kruskal-Wallis H test
was used to determine if there were statistically significant differences
between the three depression severity groups on the Executive Composite score.
Results: There was a statistically significant difference in the Executive
Composite Score between the three depression severity groups χ2(2)
= 6.187, p = 0.045, with a mean rank score of 112.69 for those with
normal/minimal depression, 90.54 for those with mild/moderate depression, and 92.96 for those with severe depression. Post-hoc, pairwise
analyses revealed only a significant difference between those with normal/minimal vs. mild/moderate depression χ2(1) = 22.152, p = 0.018.
Conclusions: Individuals with PD with mild to moderate depression
perform more poorly than those with minimal depressive symptomatology on measures of executive functioning. Depression contributes to
executive dysfunction, a core cognitive deficit in this patient population,
and should be considered when determining candidacy for DBS surgery.

The Evolving Role of Neuropsychological
Investigations in Multiple Sclerosis

R.H. BENEDICT. The Evolving Role of Neuropsychological
Investigations in Multiple Sclerosis.
Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a demyelinating disease of the central nervous system characterized by relapses and gradual worsening of chronic
neurological disability. Charcot described cognitive and personality
changes in MS patients in 1877, but it would take a century for the
quality and frequency of such impairment to be elucidated by Rao
and others. Cognitive impairment occurs in 50-60% of MS patients,
and dementia in roughly 15%. While the demyelinating WM lesion is
the pathologic hallmark of MS, neuropsychological deficits are more
robustly correlated with brain atrophy. This presentation will describe
MRI research showing strong correlation between neuropsychological
deficits and ventricle volume, normalized gray matter (GM) volume,
deep GM structures such as the thalamus, and most recently networks
involving the anterior regions of the thalamus. In all cases, neuropsychological tests emphasizing visual processing speed were most sensitive,
and closely tied to MRI measures. In addition to characterizing MS dementia, neuropsychological investigations are playing an ever increasing
role in the clinical management of this disease. Large neuropsychological
batteries were distilled to core tests useful for screening and disease
monitoring. Reversible cognitive deficits were recently captured during
relapses, broadening the construct of MS disease activity. Based on this
and related work, the FDA and EMA now recognize cognitive dysfunction as a core feature of neurological status in MS, making it a central
target of clinical trials. The presentation will also cover clinical trials
where disease-modifying therapy has shown impact on cognitive status.

psychopathology.
Symposium Description: Large-scale international collaborations are
yielding unprecedented progress in our understanding of the genetic basis of psychiatric illness. In addition to the identification of specific risk
variants that may inform novel treatments, recent studies are transforming our understanding of the overarching structure of psychopathology,
including the potential for risk to manifest in dimensional traits and
across traditional diagnostic boundaries. Because neuropsychological
functioning is impaired in a range of conditions that are now known to
share genetic risk, cognitive phenotypes represent important targets of
investigation in the next wave of studies that aim to dissect conventional
diagnoses and their underlying risk factors. In the current symposium,
we present work from a group of international collaborators examining
genetics, neuropsychological functioning and child psychopathology.
Studies capitalize on a range of behavioral and molecular genetic strategies to advance our understanding of risk mechanisms within and
across conditions. Specifically, Dr. Willcutt will use a twin strategy to
unpack the shared and unique cognitive contributions to reading and
math disabilities and ADHD. Dr. Adamo will examine polygenic risk as
a contributor to the persistence and remission of ADHD in adulthood.
Dr. Burton will use a hypothesis driven genomewide strategy to examine
the molecular genetic basis of response inhibition, a putative ADHD
endophenotype, in a large, community based sample. Finally, Dr. Doyle
will present data relating polygenic risk for schizophrenia to neuropsychological phenotypes in youth referred to a psychiatric assessment
clinic who were not specifically selected to be at risk for psychosis. Dr.
Seidman will discuss how investigations such as these may contribute
to revised, biologically-grounded models integrating genes, cognition
and psychopathology.

J.C. DEFRIES & B.F. PENNINGTON. Using Twins to Understand
the Etiology and Neuropsychology of Comorbidity between ADHD
and Learning Disorders.
Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is frequently comorbid
with learning disabilities (LDs) in reading, math, and written language,
but the etiological and neuropsychological underpinnings of these associations are not well understood. Univariate twin analyses were used to
examine the etiology of individual differences in seven neuropsychological processes, and multivariate analyses were conducted to identify the
shared and unique neuropsychological predictors of dimension of ADHD
and LDs. Twins with DSM-IV ADHD (N = 390), reading disability (RD;
N = 450), math disability (MD; N = 250), disability in written language
(WLD; N = 140), and a control sample without any of these disorders (N
= 900) completed an extensive battery of neuropsychological measures
as part of their participation in the Colorado Learning Disabilities Research Center twin study. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses
indicated that the neuropsychological battery assessed seven dimensions
of functioning: phonological awareness, response inhibition, response
variability, verbal working memory, spatial working memory, processing speed, and naming speed. RD and WLD were uniquely predicted

Forty Fourth Annual INS Meeting Abstracts
by naming speed and ADHD was predicted by response inhibition.
Shared genetic influences on verbal working memory and phonological
processing contributed to comorbidity between RD, WLD, and MD,
and weaknesses in processing speed and response variability were a
genetically-mediated shared risk factor that accounted for comorbidity
between all pairs of disorders. Taken together, these results indicate
that the etiologies and neuropsychologies of RD, MD, and ADHD are
complex and multifactorial, and illustrate how etiologically-informative
methods can help to dissect the shared and unique neuropsychological
risk factors for correlated disorders.

Do Polygenic Risk Scores Predict Persistence and Remission of
ADHD in Young Adulthood?
Persistence rates of ADHD in late adolescence and early adulthood can
reach as high as 80%. The impairments observed in persistent ADHD
are associated with a range of poor outcomes, emphasizing the importance of identifying markers for early detection and targeted intervention. Molecular genetic research is starting to identify genetic risk factors
for ADHD, and has found that around 40% of the twin heritability of
ADHD is explained by common SNP variation. Polygenic risk scores
(PRS) derived from ADHD case-control comparisons have been shown
to predict ADHD diagnosis and ADHD-trait scores in a general population sample. Preliminary data from a recent analysis on ≥17,000
ADHD cases and 94,000 controls identified genome-wide significant
loci; PRS generated from such a large dataset are expected to provide
greater power for risk predictions. Here, we will extend these findings
by examining the predictive effects of PRS on ADHD persistence/remission in a longitudinal follow-up study of children and adolescents
with ADHD. We will test whether PRS associated with childhood ADHD
predict the persistence of ADHD diagnosis, symptoms and cognitive
impairments in adolescence and early adulthood. PRS will be derived
from the recent Psychiatric Genomics Consortium ADHD-GWAS analysis and applied to London, Nijmegen and Amsterdam longitudinal
data on ADHD persistence/remittance. Children with DSM-IV combined-type ADHD aged 5-19 years completed a baseline assessment,
and a subsequent 6-year follow-up assessment where phenotypic data
on persistence/remittance of ADHD symptoms and diagnostic status, as
well as detailed cognitive and neuroimaging measures, were collected.
Of the initial samples, follow-up data on 530 participants are available.
Regression models will estimate the predictive effects of GWAS-derived
PRS on ADHD diagnosis, symptom severity and cognitive/neuroimaging
measures at follow up.

C.L. BURTON, J. CROSBIE, L. ERDMAN, A. DUPUIS, A. PATERSON,
L. STRUG, P.D. ARNOLD & R.J. SCHACHAR. A Genome-Wide
Association Study of a Cognitive Endophenotype of ADHD in a
Community-Based Pediatric Sample.
Background: The power of genome-wide association studies (GWAS)
of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is reduced by clinical/genetic heterogeneity and insufficient clinical sample sizes. Using a
cognitive endophenotype for ADHD, such as response inhibition, could
decrease heterogeneity and increase power. Novel methods such as the
hypothesis-driven GWAS (GWAS-HD) could also help identify possible biological pathways involved in response inhibition (e.g., central
nervous system [CNS] development). The GWAS-HD conducts genome-wide hypothesis testing while prioritizing single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within genes involved in the hypothesized pathway.
We conducted a GWAS-HD to test the role of SNPs involved in CNS

125
development on response inhibition measured in a large community
pediatric sample.
Methods: Salivary DNA and performance on a measure of response
inhibition (stop-signal reaction time [SSRT] from the Stop-Signal task)
were collected on 17263 youth (6-17 years of age) visiting a Science
Museum. We genotyped 5366 unrelated Caucasians using Illumina HumanCoreExome beadchips, and analyzed 4970 samples at 9,598,793
imputed and genotyped SNPs. For the GWAS-HD, individual SNPs in
the CNS development set were tested using Stratified False Discovery
Rate (SFDR) while the whole gene-set was tested using permutation
tests for association with SSRT.
Results: 94% of the sample passed QC (N = 4687). Several SNPs approached genome-wide significance (p = 1.3x10-7). The set of CNS
development SNPs were significantly associated with SSRT.
Conclusions: SNPs that alter CNS development may be involved in
response inhibition, and potentially ADHD (yet to be tested). Measurement of cognitive endophenotype such as response inhibition in a large
community sample is a feasible and potentially powerful alternative
strategy for psychiatric genetics.

S. MCCARROLL & M. FERREIRA. Association between Polygenic
Risk for Schizophrenia and Executive Functions in ClinicallyReferred Youth.
Within the complex genetic landscape of psychiatric illness, there is
strong evidence for a polygenic contribution to risk, reflecting the aggregate influence of potentially thousands of common polymorphisms
of modest individual effect. These findings converge with epidemiologic
data to suggest that, even in relatively rare and severe conditions, liability to psychopathology may, in part, be reflected in dimensional traits
that fall within or even across conventional diagnoses (i.e., wherein
phenotypic variation associates with variation in risk allele burden).
Therefore, identifying the traits that associate with polygenic risk for
a given condition may help to clarify how its genetic risk manifests.
The current study highlights the potential value of this line of inquiry
by relating polygenic risk for schizophrenia (SCZ) to three domains of
executive functions in clinically referred youth who are not specifically
at risk for psychosis. Data are from the Longitudinal Study of Genetic
Influences on Cognition (LOGIC). Subjects were 117 youth, ages 8 to
20, who were consecutively referred for evaluation at a pediatric assessment clinic and who had available genomewide data. Results showed
that the burden of SCZ risk alleles, as determined by large studies in the
literature, associated with variation in working memory and inhibition
but not with goal maintenance. Relationships remained robust after controlling for age, sex and the use of psychotropic medications. Findings
suggest that SCZ genetic loading is associated with neuropsychological
phenotypes that extend across conventional diagnostic boundaries. Such
data support the potential of translational genetic studies that include
neuropsychological phenotypes to contribute to an improved psychiatric
nosology, as promoted by NIMH’s recent RDoC initiative.

Invited Symposium 2. Sleep and Cognition
Chair: Ian M. Colrain

3:45–5:05 p.m.
I.M. COLRAIN, M.S. ALOIA, D.L. BLIWISE & I.M. COLRAIN. Sleep
and Cognition.
Symposium Description: Sleep is a fundamental behavior that supports physical, mental and emotional health and facilitates neuropsychological functioning in humans of all ages. While the fundamental
question of why sleep is needed remains largely unanswered, it is clear,
that insufficient sleep, disrupted sleep or poorly timed sleep can be
extremely disruptive to human health and lead to diminished cognitive capability. Both sleep and cognitive function vary systematically
across the lifespan, and interrelationships are clearly complex and may
be very different at different points in the normal developmental trajectory. For example, decreases in slow wave sleep and its associated
delta EEG power may be associated with decreased cognitive function
in older adults, but even more dramatic decreases in delta power across
adolescence are typically occurring at a time when cognitive function is
improving. As has historically been the case in neuropsychology, the role
of sleep in supporting cognitive function can be informed by the examination of pathology. In this symposium three areas of disease known
to be associated with sleep disruption will be presented in the context of
normal age-related changes in both sleep and cognitive function. Dr. Bliwise will discuss the role of sleep in supporting cognitive function normal
aging and relations between sleep and cognitive decline in dementia. Dr.
Aloia with discuss interrelationships between Obstructive Sleep Apnea,
brain structure and cognitive function and the role of CPAP therapy in
restoring brain and cognitive health. Finally, Dr. Colrain will discuss
the role of sleep and sleep EEG changes in brain and cognitive changes
associated with Alcohol Use Disorder.

Little, however, has disentangled the effects of sleep fragmentation from
those of oxygen saturation. This presentation will outline the neuropsychological effects of sleep apnea and will incorporate the neuroimaging
studies as well. We will attempt to provide a unifying model and to better
understand the potential benefits from treatment.

I.M. COLRAIN. Alcoholism: Sleep, Brain and Cognitive
Consequences.
Alcohol abuse and dependence are associated with changes in brain
macro and micro-structure, especially in prefrontal cortex, and diminished neurocognitive function. They are also associated with chronic
sleep disturbance, lower slow wave sleep, and more rapid eye movement
sleep than normal. There is also recent evidence for altered autonomic
nervous system recovery during sleep in alcoholism. Alcohol acts as a
sedative that interacts with several neurotransmitter systems important in the regulation of sleep. Acute administration of large amounts
of alcohol prior to sleep leads to decreased sleep onset latency and
changes in sleep architecture early in the night, when blood alcohol
levels are high, with subsequent disrupted, poor quality sleep later in
the night. While these aspects of altered sleep can last long into periods
of abstinence and may play a role in relapse, there is also evidence for
partial recovery of EEG and ANS function with cessation of drinking.
This presentation will review the data relating sleep architecture, EEG
and ANS changes in alcoholism with changes in brain structure and
function, and the extent to which sleep changes may exacerbate the
negative effects of alcoholism on brain function during active drinking,
and assist in recovery with abstinence.

D.L. BLIWISE. Cognition and Sleep in Normal and Pathological
Aging.
A wide array of research, including both observational cross-sectional
and longitudinal population-based work as well as laboratory studies,
bear upon associations between broadly defined cognition and sleep
(Scullin & Bliwise, Perspect Psychol Sci 2015; 10: 97-137). Not surprisingly, the diversity of cohorts studied, the relative precision/crudeness
of neuropsychological assessments, and not the least, the types of data
that constitute the measurement of “sleep” in these studies have led
to widely disparate results. This presentation will attempt to present
an overview of this large body of research, with a special emphasis on
methodological challenges and study designs and factors that may play a
role in the relative consistency or lack thereof of findings. Experimental
studies of sleep loss and effects on cognition in particular may present
a particularly valuable counterpoint for examining age as a moderator
effect of such associations.

M.S. ALOIA. Neuropsychological Consequences of Obstructive
Sleep Apnea.
Obstructive Sleep Apnea affects approximately 7% of the US population and rates are increasing with the obesity epidemic. The disorder
is characterized by repeated cessation of breathing during sleep, which
is accompanied by increased sleep fragmentation and decreased blood
oxygen levels. These events affect directly the brains of some patients.
The past decade has seen tremendous growth in the understanding of
brain abnormalities associated with the disorder. Neuropsychological
studies have consistently focused on attentional and executive networks.
Imaging studies have highlighted specific, corresponding brain regions.

Derived Subtypes of Neuropsychological Impairment in HIV-1
Infection.
Objective: Despite combination antiretroviral therapy (CART), neuropsychological impairment (NPI) persists among HIV-1-positive (HIV+)
persons, and its heterogeneous profile complicates the study of its etiology and treatment. This heterogeneity may be due to the presence of
multiple subtypes of NPI with distinct underlying pathologies. Thus, we
used statistical modeling to identify NPI subtypes and their correlates
among HIV+ adults.
Participants and Methods: 193 HIV+ adults (aged 26-73; 97% on
CART) enrolled in the Drexel Medicine CNS AIDS Research and Eradication Study (CARES) Cohort completed tests of working memory,
executive function, psychomotor speed, language, episodic memory, and
visuoconstruction. Thirteen neuropsychological parameters adjusted for
age, education, gender, and race were entered in a latent class analysis
(LCA). Demographic, immunological, and substance use characteristics
were compared across classes.
Results: LCA identified four classes: neuropsychologically intact (n=74;
38%), mild psychomotor slowing (n=30; 16%), mild visuoconstruction/
memory impairment (n=57; 30%), and moderate mixed impairment
(n=32; 17%). The latter two groups had higher rates of hepatitis C
infection and past benzodiazepine use than the intact group, and the
moderate mixed impairment group also had longer HIV duration and a
higher rate of past opiate use. The psychomotor slowing group was older

Forty Fourth Annual INS Meeting Abstracts
and had a higher rate of past stavudine use and a lower rate of current
efavirenz use. All impaired groups had higher rates of past zidovudine
use. Groups did not differ in sex, race, education, HIV RNA, CD4, ART
duration, or use of other substances.
Conclusions: Three NPI subtypes with distinct clinical correlates were
identified among HIV+ adults. Classification by profile, rather than
severity alone, may clarify the study of NPI in HIV+ persons. Future
research should examine the pathologies underlying empirically derived NPI subtypes and the efficacy of targeted treatments. NIH R01

D. STEIN, J.M. HEAPS, L. SALMINEN & R. PAUL. Topological
Organization of Whole-Brain Networks in HIV+ Individuals.
Objective: Neuroimaging studies have revealed that human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) leads to structural and functional abnormalities in
specific brain regions and connections. However, little is known about
alterations of the topological organization of whole-brain networks.
Further, the relationships between topological organization and neuropsychological performance in HIV+ individuals are unclear. In the
present study we examined these patterns using graph theory-based
approaches with complex network analysis.
Participants and Methods: Twenty-nine antiretroviral therapy-naive
HIV+ adults and 16 demographically similar controls in South Africa
underwent a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan and neuropsychological testing. Structural network models of white matter connectivity
were constructed using diffusion MRI-based multi-fiber tractography
and T1-weighted MRI –based regional gray matter segmentation. Global
network measures of whole-brain functional integration, connection
strength, and functional segregation were examined between groups
using multivariate analysis of variance. Further, correlations between
topological organization metrics and a global deficit score (GDS) were
examined.
Results: HIV+ individuals exhibit altered quantitative values in wholebrain networks, characterized by lower functional integration (path
length and efficiency), connection strength, and functional segregation
(clustering coefficient) compared to controls (ps <. 01). Partial correlation analyses revealed statistically significant relationships between GDS
and global efficiency (r= –.55, p= .006), connection strength (r= –.45,
p= .028), and clustering coefficient (r= –.59, p= .003).
Conclusions: Individuals with HIV demonstrate weaker topological
organization of whole-brain networks than seronegative controls, which
correspond to worse neuropsychological performance. Future studies
should examine the local connectivity in specific regions of interest affected by HIV in order to clarify the impact of HIV on brain connectivity.

(e.g., perceived knowledge of tasks, prediction of performance). Participants also completed the Fluid NIH Toolbox Cognitive Battery, Frontal Systems Behavior Apathy Scale, and Beck Depression Inventory-II.
A research nurse completed a clinician’s rating of each participant’s
health-related functional status (i.e., Karnofsky Score).
Results: More accurate global metacognition was significantly associated with better executive functions (Toolbox Dimensional Change
Card Sorting Test; p<0.05, rho=0.47) and higher current functional
status (Karnofsky Score; p<0.05, rho=0.67) but not attention, memory,
or psychomotor speed. In a multivariable regression model, objective
executive functions, apathy, depressive symptoms, nadir CD4 and global
metacognition accounted for 53.7% of the variance in health-related
functional status (Model: F(5, 20)=5.4, p=0.006), with global metacognition emerging as the only significant term (β=0.52, p=0.02).
Conclusions: Metacognition demonstrated strong and specific associations with executive dysfunction (e.g., set-shifting) and uniquely
contributed to manifest functional status in HIV disease. Interventions
aimed at aligning awareness of daily functioning abilities with objective
capacity may be useful improving everyday and health outcomes in HIV.

functioning- Evidence from Zambia.
Objective: Human Immuno deficinecy Virus (HIV) infection and Tuberculosis (TB) often co exists in such a way that they are often described
as a co-epidemic. TB is the most common HIV-related co-infection in
Zambia and is considered an underlying cause of HIV associated neurocognitive deficits. The objective of the study was to explore the effects
of TB on neurobehavioural functioning in HIV positive Zambian adults
using T-scores developed In Zambia.
Participants and Methods: Participants included 243 HIV positive
adults from the six clinics offering HIV testing and care in Lusaka,
Zambia, with minimum five years of schooling and ability to read and
understand English. The Test Battery included standardized tests of
Attention/Working Memory, Executive Function, Verbal Fluency,
Processing Speed, Verbal fluency. All patients were on anti-retroviral
therapy (ART). Clinic records were reviewed to obtain CD4+ T-cell
counts and TB history.
Results: TB positive (n=65) and TB negative (n=178) groups did not
differ in age, gender (69% women), or education. Subjects with a history
of TB had lower CD4+ T-cell counts (mean= 405) than those without TB
(mean= 509) (p < 0.05). Those with a history of TB had worse verbal
fluency (p < 0.05) working memory (p < 0.05), recall (p < 0.05), and
global cognitive functioning (p < 0.05). Groups did not differ in speed
of information processing or executive or motor functioning.
Conclusions: The results are indicate that co-infective of HIV and
TB leads to worse neurobehavioral functioning and those with TB are
likely to have lower current CD4+ T-cell counts, even though they are
on anti-retroviral treatment.

Metacognition is Associated with Executive Dysfunction and
Manifest Everyday Functioning in HIV Infection.
Objective: HIV infection commonly disrupts frontal brain systems and
is associated with less accurate awareness of cognitive and functional
abilities (i.e., metacognition), which may contribute to poorer real-world
outcomes (e.g., medication nonadherence). We assessed the relationship
between metacognition and everyday functioning among those living
with HIV.
Participants and Methods: Thirty HIV+ adults with executive dysfunction performed a complex functional capacity task in the laboratory
(i.e., multitasking of medication and financial management, cooking,
and health communication) during which awareness of performance
was measured according to Toglia & Kirk’s (2000) metacognitive model

Elucidating Depressive Symptom, Cognitive, and Affective
Dimensions through Integrated Neuropsychological and
Cognitive Neurosciences.
Symposium Description: Depressive disorders affect approximately 14
million adults in the US every year and are associated with significant
morbidity and mortality. Neuropsychological and cognitive neuroscience
studies are essential to clarifying the etiopathology and consequences
of depressive disorders, thereby informing the diagnosis and treatment
of depression across the adult lifespan. In light of the heterogeneous
nature of depressive symptoms, recent studies in this area have focused
on understanding the correlates of specific symptom dimensions of depression. These studies, supported by factor analysis, differentiate between symptom clusters including negative mood, cognitive disturbance,
somatic complaints, anhedonia, and interpersonal difficulties. Emerging
evidence suggests that different symptom dimensions have distinct cognitive, affective, and neural substrates, as well as unique genetic, physiological, and neurological causes and therapeutic responsiveness. Further
research is needed in this relatively new area of inquiry, which is in line
with the National Institute of Mental Health’s (NIMH) Research Domain
Criteria (RDoC) Project. Such work has the potential to enhance our
understanding of personalized treatment mechanisms and pathways to
enhance the speed and efficiency of our mood disorder treatment strategies. The purpose of this symposium is to: 1) detail clinical evidence
for distinct depressive symptom dimensions, 2) discuss cognitive and
neuroimaging correlates of symptom dimensions, 3) review recent and
emerging studies documenting differential treatment effects on symptom
dimensions and disease course, and 4) synthesize information and provide prospective research recommendations. The four presentations will
be followed by a discussion facilitated by program staff of the NIMH.

V.M. DOTSON. Symptom Dimensions in Late-Life Subthreshold
Depression: Evidence from Cognitive, Neuroscience, and Exercise
Intervention Studies.
Depression is a clinically heterogeneous disorder, with significant variability in symptom profiles of individuals with both subthreshold and
major depression. A small but growing body of work has supported the
idea of different genetic risks and etiological contributors associated
with different symptom dimensions of depression. There is also evidence that symptom dimensions are differentially related to cognitive
functioning, brain structure, and brain function. This research is limited
and primarily focuses on major depression, with less emphasis on subthreshold symptoms. Subthreshold depression is common, particularly
in older adults. These symptoms are clinically meaningful, as they are
associated with similar negative outcomes as major depression, including functional disability, poor health, and all-cause mortality. There is
also evidence that late-life subthreshold depression is associated with
similar cognitive deficits and brain changes as major depression, but
the importance of symptom dimensions in these relationships is thus
far unclear. This presentation will summarize results of recent studies
examining symptom dimensions of late-life subthreshold depression in
relation to regional brain volumes, white matter lesions, and cognitive
functioning. Data demonstrating distinct genetic risks and responses

to exercise associated with different symptom dimensions will also be
presented.

S.A. LANGENECKER. Cognitive Control Dysfunction in Major
Depression Disorder: a Lifespan Perspective.
Objective: Many individuals with major depressive disorder (MDD) experience executive function difficulties. The present talk will present
results from three studies that address the presence, course, state-dependence, and age-related cognitive control and executive function decline
in those with MDD across the adult age range.
Methods. The first study of adults between 18 and 23, compared those
with MDD in remission (n = 62) to Healthy controls (HC, n = 42) using
executive functioning tests. The second study compared a large sample
of depressed individuals (n = 448) across the adult age range to an age/
education matched HC sample (n = 276) who completed the Parametric
Go/No-go test, a measure of cognitive control. The third study compared
elder patients (n = 653) without dementia, and in who MDD symptoms
were evaluated for impact on executive function.
Results. For study 1, in a younger, remitted MDD sample, difficulties
in inhibitory control were evident relative to HC. In study 2, there is
evidence of broad executive function impairments. These difficulties
showed no different slope in decline by age relative to HC group. Study
3 suggested that older adults with depressive symptoms were more likely
to have executive function impairment. These executive function difficulties were compounded in those with memory impairment and MDD.
Conclusions. Cognitive control difficulties appear early in the course
of MDD, are exacerbated in the context of active symptoms, yet do not
decline at an increased rate relative to healthy adults. In older adults
however, there is evidence that the presence of depressive symptoms increases the likelihood that executive function impairments will be present. Such effects are worsened in the presence of memory impairment.
It is unclear, whether specific individuals are vulnerable to accelerated
cognitive decline, or what mechanisms might account for these cognitive
difficulties, which are important questions for future studies.

M. TREADWAY. Neural Mechanisms of Effort-Based DecisionMaking in Depression.
Background: Psychiatric symptoms of fatigue, anhedonia and low-motivation are common across many disorders. These symptoms have been
operationalized in terms of effort-based decision-making. It is unclear,
however, whether anhedonia is associated with diminished reward-value
encoding, or a hypo-responsiveness to required effort. Preclinical studies suggest that the ventral striatum is critical for both functions, but
empirical evidence is lacking in clinical populations.
Methods: We present data from a recent functional neuroimaging study
of 42 depressed outpatients and demographically-matched controls who
were scanned while making a series of decisions regarding effort allocation using a novel effort-based decision-making paradigm. A parabolic
discounting model was fitted to each subject to determine the trial-wise
subjective value of different effort/reward combinations.
Results: Across all subjects, trial-wise subjective value of different effort/
reward combinations was shown to selectively elicit activity in vmPFC.
In the ventral striatum, neural responses appeared to initially encode
reward value when choice options were presented, and then showed a
transfer to encoding effort-level at the point of choice healthy. However, this effect was stronger in controls than patients. Moreover, it was
significantly correlated with a trait measure of reward anticipation.
Conclusion: These results isolate neural differences between depressed
patients and healthy controls when engaged in effort-based decision-making. Both groups demonstrated normal responses in vmPFC
and ventral striatum in response to initial choice values. Controls and

Forty Fourth Annual INS Meeting Abstracts

129

patients differed though in the extent to which ventral striatum signaling switched from reward value to effort encoding. Moreover, stronger
effort encoding at time of choice in the striatum was associated with
elevated trait anticipation. These data help further elucidate the neural
mechanisms of effort-based decision-making in depression.

Plenary D (The INS Herbert Birch Memorial
Lecture). Adolescence as a Sensitive Period of
Social Brain Development

S.M. MCCLINTOCK. Elucidating Complex Interactions
Among Depressive symptoms, Neurocognitive Function, and
Neurotherapeutic Stimulation.
Major depressive disorder (MDD) is comprised of a constellation of heterogeneous affective and cognitive symptoms. Indeed, many individuals
with MDD present with multiple depressive symptoms (e.g., sad mood,
anhedonia) and inefficient or impaired cognitive functions (e.g., executive dysfunction); however, the relationship among the multiple symptoms remains unknown. Specifically, evidence suggests that affective
symptoms lead to changes in cognitive function in younger adults, but
that changes in cognitive function lead to affective symptoms in older
adults. Across the adult life-span, patients with MDD that is resistant
to standard pharmacotherapeutics or psychotherapy often are treated
with electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). The use of ECT provides a unique
opportunity to examine the association between affective and cognitive
symptoms in MDD across the adult life-span, while providing objective
neurophysiological metrics (electroencephalography) that underlie such
symptoms. This presentation will 1) describe the constellation of multiple MDD symptoms, 2) discuss changes in depressive and cognitive
symptoms after treatment with ECT, 3) review the use of standard neuropsychological and cognitive neuroscience tools to assess state and trait
cognitive symptoms, and 4) synthesize affective and cognitive symptom
measurement with neurophysiological indices.

S. BLAKEMORE. Adolescence as a Sensitive Period of Social Brain
Development.
The brain has evolved to understand and interact with other people.
This talk focuses on how the social brain, that is the network of brain
regions involved in understanding others, develops during adolescence.
Adolescence is a time characterised by change - hormonally, physically, psychologically and socially. Social cognitive processes involved
in navigating an increasingly complex social world continue to develop
throughout human adolescence. Areas of the social brain undergo significant reorganisation in terms of structure and function during the second
decade of life, which possibly reflects a sensitive period for adapting to
the social environment. The changes in social environment that occur
during adolescence might interact with increasing executive functions,
heightened social sensitivity and the developing social brain to influence
a number of adolescent behaviours, including risk-taking, peer influence and self-consciousness. I will discuss the importance of taking into
account the social environment and the social brain when considering
adolescent-typical behaviour.
Learning Objectives
Through participation in this course, attendees will be able:
To list social brain areas and to describe the development of the social
brain in adolescence, and
To demonstrate the importance of the social environment in adolescent
development.

Frontotemporal Degeneration
Presenter: Katya Rascovsky

7:20–8:50 a.m.
K. RASCOVSKY. Cognitive and Behavioral Aspects of
Frontotemporal Degeneration.
Frontotemporal degeneration (FTD) can manifest as a spectrum of
clinical syndromes, ranging from behavioral impairment to language
or motor dysfunction. Recently, revised diagnostic criteria have been
proposed for the behavioral and progressive aphasia syndromes associated with frontotemporal degeneration. The course will summarize these
diagnostic guidelines, and highlight some lingering controversies in the
classification of FTD clinical syndromes. We will discuss common tools
and methods used to identify the insidious cognitive and behavioral
changes of behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD). With
regards to primary progressive aphasia (PPA), we will discuss the scope
of the semantic disorder in semantic-variant PPA, the nature of the
speech disorder in non-fluent, agrammatic PPA, and the preliminary
utility of a logopenic PPA classification.
Learning Objectives
As a result of participation in this course, the learner will achieve the
following objectives:
Participants will be introduced to the frontotemporal degeneration spectrum of disorders;

Through patient videos and discussion, participants will be able to recognize the typical cognitive and behavioral characteristics of bvFTD
and PPA; and
Participants will be able to diagnose bvFTD and PPA according to
revised criteria.

The diagnosis and treatment of mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) have
historically been hampered by an incomplete base of scientific evidence
to guide clinicians. Major advances in the basic and clinical science of
mTBI over the past decade have increased our understanding of the
natural history of injury and recovery in civilians, athletes, and military
service members affected by mTBI. As a result, we have a more clear
understanding of how acute injury characteristics and comorbidities
affect recovery and outcome. Collectively, the new evidence base now

establishes a foundation on which to build integrative approaches to
injury assessment and treatment. This workshop will provide a focused
review of the current scientific literature on mTBI and discuss clinical
translation designed to improve outcome and reduce disability associated with this injury.

Treatment and Neurocognitive Factors among Children Diagnosed
with Craniopharyngioma.
Objective: A cancer diagnosis is stressful for the entire family. Children
with craniopharyngiomas (Cp) can present with challenging medical
and cognitive problems due to tumor location and associated co-morbidities. The current study examined parental distress in a sample of
Cp patient families to identify associated treatment related factors for
targeted intervention.
Participants and Methods: Prior to (n=72) and one year after (n=40)
proton therapy, parents of children diagnosed with Cp (9.66 yrs at
baseline; 49% male) completed a self-report measure of distress, the
Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI). Parental BSI scores were examined in
relation to child cognitive outcomes, parent ratings of child behavior,
and medical variables.
Results: At baseline, parents scored higher than normative expectations
on anxiety (53±10.3; p=.015), depression (52.1±8.8; p=.046), Global
Severity (53.2±9.2; p=.004) and Positive Symptom Distress (53.4±10.4;
p=.008), with no significant change a year later. No meaningful pattern
of association was observed between BSI and cognitive performance
measures, with isolated correlations in the opposite direction as hypothesized (e.g. higher IQ=more distress). Parents reporting higher levels
of distress rated their children as having worse behavior regulation
(BASC-2 ps=<.001-.015), executive functioning (BRIEF ps=<.001.050), and adaptive skills (ABAS-II ps=.010-.050). Parent distress was
not associated with medical variables (e.g. number/extent of surgeries,
diabetes insipidus).
Conclusions: Parents are experiencing significant distress before their
child begins proton therapy for Cp. Increased medical complications
do not elevate distress risk. The relationship of parent-rated executive
function, behavior regulation and adaptive skill difficulties in their child
with parental distress suggests these deficits may affect parental coping
more than cognitive problems. It may also reflect a negative reporting
style among some parents, overestimating patient difficulties through
the lens of their own distress.

Disordered Sleep and Attention Problems among Children with
Histories of Cancer and Stem Cell Transplantation.
Objective: Children with a history of cancer are at an increased risk
for sleep problems, and this effect may be enhanced by certain treatments, including hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) (Ferry
et al., 2007; Rosen et al., 2008). In turn, disordered sleep can have
pernicious effects on children’s cognition, in particular their attention
(Beebe, 2006). As such, the current study examined associations between disordered sleep and attention, among children with a history of
cancer. We also investigated differences among those with and without
a history of HSCT.
Participants and Methods: We conducted a retrospective case review
of children with a history of cancer referred to our neuropsychology
clinic. Participants including 136 children (60% male; M age = 11.52
years), of which 30 had a history of HSCT. Sleep problems were assessed
with the Sleep-Related Breathing Disorder scale of the Pediatric Sleep
Questionnaire. Children completed the Integrated Visual and Auditory
Continuous Performance Test, which includes measures of attention and
response control. We also collected parent-ratings of inattention (Child
Behavior Checklist, Conners’ Rating Scale).
Results: Using multiple regression analyses, we examined the associations between sleep-disordered breathing and attention, considering
differences between cancer survivors treated with and without HSCT.
Sleep problems were negatively related to visual attention and auditory
response control, only among children treated with HSCT. Sleep-disordered breathing was positively associated with parent-rated inattention,
with stronger effects among those treated with HSCT.
Conclusions: Prior research has underscored multiple factors which
may have a pernicious effect on attention, including histories of cancer,
HSCT, and sleep problems. Such risk factors may not only be additive,
but multiplicative. Indeed, we found that, among childhood cancer survivors, sleep-disordered breathing confers the greatest risk of inattention
when children also have a history of HSCT.

S. BOOKHEIMER, L. LIAU & B.M. ELLINGSON. Voxel-Based
Lesion-Symptom Mapping of Phonemic Fluency versus Semantic
Fluency in Brain Tumor Patients.
Objective: We examined the relationship between lesion presence and
verbal fluency performance, as well as the neuroanatomical regions
specific to fluency type, on a voxel-by-voxel basis in brain tumor patients using innovative voxel-based lesion-symptom mapping (VLSM).
Participants and Methods: 98 right-handed adults with primary gliomas were administered Phonemic Fluency and Semantic Fluency tasks.
Participants ranged from 18 to 80 years old (M = 47) with 60% males.
T2-weighted images were registered to a T1-weighted MNI atlas and
the tumor region was contoured. For each voxel, patients were grouped
by whether or not tumor was present, and a general linear model was
performed to compare the fluency scores of these two groups while
controlling for demographics and tumor characteristics. Statistical maps
of each task along with subtraction maps (Phonemic Fluency minus
Category Fluency and vice versa) were created.
Results: VLSM identified several clusters of voxels with a significant
relationship (p < .05) between lesion presence and verbal fluency performance. Neuroanatomical correlates shared across the tasks included
the superior longitudinal fasciculus, internal capsule, inferior parietal
lobule, postcentral gyrus, rolandic operculum, cingulate gyrus, Heschl’s
gyrus, corona radiata, middle and superior temporal gyri, and middle
and superior frontal gyri. On the subtraction maps, few regions were
specific to Category Fluency, whereas Phonemic Fluency was associated
with anterior regions including the precentral gyrus, inferior frontal gyrus, anterior cingulate cortex, and anterior limb of the internal capsule.

Forty Fourth Annual INS Meeting Abstracts
Conclusions: These findings identified the key anatomic structures
involved in verbal fluency performance in brain tumor patients using an
innovative lesion analysis technique. The resulting statistical parametric maps and subtraction maps were supportive of theories suggesting
Phonemic Fluency involves similar posterior structures to those used
during Category Fluency while recruiting additional anterior structures.

Predictors of Learning and Memory Performance in Patients
Diagnosed with Pediatric Craniopharyngioma.
Objective: Impairments in learning and memory have been found in
pediatric patients with craniopharyngioma treated with surgical intervention and radiation therapy. It remains unclear how pre-irradiation
condition and specific treatment variables influence learning and memory. The goal of this study was to investigate the relationship between
patient, disease and treatment-related variables with learning/memory
outcomes in pediatric patients prior to proton therapy.
Participants and Methods: Participants (N=78; 48.7% male) completed the California Verbal Learning Test (CVLT). Patients ranged in
age from 1 to 20 (M=9.66; SD=4.67) and the majority (87.18%) had
at least one surgical intervention (M=1.42; SD=.96). Linear regression
models were conducted to determine whether clinical variables (e.g.,
gender, degree of pre-surgical hypothalamic involvement [HI], extent
of surgical intervention) predicted performance on measures of learning
and memory prior to proton therapy.
Results: T-tests demonstrated that participants performed worse than
normative expectations on indexes of the CVLT (Total Trials p=0.00;
short delay free recall p=0.02; long delay free recall p=0.00). Linear regressions revealed degree of pre-operative HI (Grade 3 β=-8.34, p=0.01)
and extent of surgical intervention (β=-10.03, p=0.01) predicted verbal
learning proficiency. Short-term free recall was predicted by degree of
pre-operative HI (Grade 3 β=-1.11, p=0.00). Long-term free recall was
predicted by degree of pre-operative HI (Grade 3 β=-1.16, p=0.00)
and extent of surgical intervention (β=-1.12, p = 0.02). For each of
these findings, participants with more extensive surgical intervention
and greater degree of HI, including the mammillary bodies, performed
more poorly.
Conclusions: These findings indicate that patients are at increased
risk for impairment in learning and memory prior to adjuvant therapy.
Disease and treatment related factors were predictive of risk in a way
that may inform treatment planning.

V.W. WILLARD & K.K. HARDY. Profiles of Attention-Mediated
Neurocognitive Functioning in Survivors of Pediatric Brain
Tumors: Comparison with Children with Neurodevelopmental
ADHD.
Objective: Attention problems are one of the most common neurocognitive late effects observed in survivors of pediatric brain tumors (BT).
Deficits in attention have been linked to declines in intelligence, academics, social and adaptive functioning. Given similarities in functional impairment between BT survivors and children with neurodevelopmental
ADHD, researchers have turned to the ADHD literature for intervention
ideas. However, no study has compared the neuropsychological profiles
of attention and related processes between these two groups.
Participants and Methods: Neuropsychological data from clinically-referred samples of survivors of BT (n=72, mean age=11.5, 55.6%
male) and children with ADHD (n=43, mean age=10.6, 58.1% male)

131
were abstracted. Parents completed the CBCL, BRIEF, and ADHD Rating Scale (ADHD-RS), and children completed a Wechsler intelligence
scale along with measures of attention and executive functioning. The
9 DSM-5 symptoms of inattention from the ADHD-RS were used to
determine which survivors met symptom criteria (i.e., ≥6 symptoms)
for ADHD.
Results: Survivors averaged 6.6 years (SD = 3.96) at diagnosis, and
were evaluated 5.2 (SD=2.95) years later. The majority (65.3%) received radiation therapy. 13 survivors (18%) met symptom criteria for
ADHD. Participants with developmental ADHD and survivors meeting
ADHD symptom criteria had more parent-reported difficulties with
working memory (WM) and metacognition than BT survivors without
attention problems. Children with attention problems also exhibited
significantly lower performance on WM tasks, but not processing speed
tasks, than those without ADHD symptoms.
Conclusions: Survivors with attention symptoms have neurocognitive
profiles that are similar to children with ADHD, although deficits in
processing speed appear to be pervasive among all survivors regardless
of attention difficulties. Screening for ADHD symptoms among survivors
may help providers to more tailored treatment options for a subgroup
of survivors meeting symptom criteria for ADHD.

B. GOGIA. Neuropsychological Implications of Gliomas in Left
Fronto-Parietal Operculum with respect to Tumor Size and Grade.
Objective: Fronto-parietal operculum of dominant hemisphere comprises of Broca’s area (Brodmann area 44,45) and Supplementary Motor
Area(SMA) or Premotor Cortex (Brodmann area 6). Lesions in these
areas are known to produce Neuropsychological deficits like expressive
aphasia and difficulty in language comprehension, apraxias, cognitive
problems and impaired fine motor control. However, these deficits with
respect to size and grade of primary brain gliomas restricted to fronto-parietal operculum in dominant hemisphere have not been studied
before.
Participants and Methods: A retrospective study was conducted on
17 right handed patients with brain tumor in left front-parietal operculum prior to surgical resection. Data pertaining to tumor grade and
pre-operative neuropsychological evaluation was collected from the clinical database. 1 case was excluded due to lack of neuropsychological
evaluation. We used a grading system for deficits found on neuropsychological evaluation note. We used 0 for no impairment, 1 for mild
and 2 for moderate to severe impairment. We then compared deficits
to tumor size and grade.
Results: Out of 16 patients, 4 were low grade gliomas (WHO grade I &
II) and 12 were high grade gliomas (WHO grade III & IV). The mean
size of the tumor was 4.11cms. We observed that LGGs as large as 6cms
presented with absent to mild neuropsychological deficits whereas HGGs
as small as 1.4 cms presented with severe impairments on neuropsychological evaluation.
Conclusions: Neuropsychological deficits are more likely to be present
in High Grade Gliomas irrespective of their sizes. Low Grade Gliomas
as large as 6 cms either present with mild or no impairment on neuropsychological examination.

Functioning in Pediatric Medulloblastoma.
Objective: Brain tumors and treatment (e.g., surgery, radiation therapy) are associated with executive function impairment that is a risk

132
factor for potential loss of eventual independence. There is new interest in the causes of executive dysfunction, such as family function.
This study examined how longitudinal profiles of family functioning
following diagnosis are associated with executive function in pediatric
medulloblastoma survivors.
Participants and Methods: Participants comprised 111 medulloblastoma patients (mean age at diagnosis=8.64 years) enrolled on a longitudinal, multi-institution study. Caregivers completed questionnaires
at baseline (after surgery) and 12- and 36-months post-diagnosis. A
prior report used longitudinal latent profile analyses to identify discrete
patterns of functioning on scales of the Family Environment Scale.
Families endorsed high, moderate, or low levels that were generally
stable over time for the Control, Independence, and Organization scales.
ANCOVA was used to examine differences among family functioning
profiles on caregiver report of child executive functioning at 36-months
post-diagnosis via the Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function.
Age at diagnosis and disease risk status were covariates.
Results: For the Control scale, families with stricter rules and procedures rated their child as having more problems with emotional control
(p=.01), shifting (p=.04), and initiation (p=.01). For the Independence
scale, families who were the least assertive and self-sufficient rated their
child as having more problems with initiation (p<.01) and working
memory (p=.02). For the Organization scale, families who were the least
structured and organized rated their child as having more problems with
organizing materials (p=.01).
Conclusions: Results suggest family functioning is associated with
executive function outcomes in pediatric medulloblastoma survivors.
Development of interventions aimed at improving family functioning
along with educational resources for families may be warranted.

S. HILE, S.M. DINCES, R.D. ANNETT & S.J. ERICKSON. Functional
Impairment in Childhood Cancer Survivors: Relationship with
NIH Examiner Executive Measures and General Intellectual
Functioning.
Objective: Childhood cancer survivors are at risk for long-term neurocognitive late effects including impairments in executive functioning
(EF) and general intellectual functioning (IQ) (Moore, 2005; Moore,
Ater, & Copeland, 1992; Mulhern, Wasserman, Fairclough, & Ochs,
1988). The functional impact of these late effects is not well understood. In our previous work (Hile et al, 2014) functional impairment
(FI) in survivors occurred frequently (26%); however, no control group
comparison was made. The objective of the current study is to build
upon current understandings of functional impairment by examining
the relationship between EF, IQ and FI in cancer survivors compared
with healthy controls.
Participants and Methods: Child cancer survivors, ages 5-18, at
least 1 year post-treatment were eligible. Health controls (HCs) were
recruited from the community. Parents completed the 23-item Brief
Impairment Scale (BIS; Bird et al., 2005). Children completed the Brief
Impairment Scale-Child Version (BIS-CV), IQ (Reynolds Intellectual
Screening Test) and EF measures (NIH Examiner).
Results: 20 survivors and 41 HCs enrolled. No difference in rate of FI
between survivors and HCs was observed. IQ and EF measures were
comparable in survivors and HCs. Multiple stepwise regression examined the relationship between IQ, EF and FI in survivors and HCs.
Results found that verbal IQ significantly predicted FI in survivors F(1,
16) =9.49, p=0.01, b=-0.62., but not in HCs F(1, 33)= 1.49, p=0.23,
b=-0.27.
Conclusions: Functional impairment (FI) is common in 5-18 year old
cancer survivors and HC children, thus FI does not discriminate survivors from HCs. Our findings indicate that EF and IQ are not adversely
impacted by pediatric cancer; yet verbal reasoning specifically predicted
functional impairment in cancer survivors only.

J. IRISH, S.K. PATEL & A.A. NOLTY. Childhood Cancer Survivors’
Executive Functioning Skills: Does Scaffolding Bolster Behavioral
Functioning?
Objective: In order to accommodate for weak executive functions (EF),
exterior scaffolding is often indicated for children and adolescents who
are survivors of cancer. Since parents typically become accustomed to
intervening with the child during acute illness and medical treatment
phases and are comfortable acting as a child’s external executive, a
psychoeducation intervention was provided to empower them to help
their child cancer survivors. We expected children whose parents participated in the intervention to demonstrate improvement in EF, and
that EF at baseline would be associated with greater improvements in
behavior functioning (BF).
Participants and Methods: Our sample consisted of 44 childhood
cancer survivors between the ages of 6 and 18 whose parents were
randomly assigned to a parent training intervention or a waitlist. The
intervention included eight 75- to 90-minute sessions over a 3-month
period in which parents learned about various aspects of attention, EF,
and memory, and practiced techniques to implement with their child.
Phone support was provided on a bi-weekly basis for an additional 3
months, after which there was follow-up testing for the child.
Results: Children of parents in the intervention group tended to have
less proactive interference on the CVLT-C following the intervention.
Additionally, children with stronger pre-intervention BRIEF General
Executive Composites (GEC) benefited more from their parents’ intervention, such that the GEC tended to correlate with decreases in BASC-2
Externalizing Problems (r = .46, p = .07) and Behavioral Symptoms
(r = .67, p = .007), which was not the case for children in the control
group (r = .03, p = .92, & r = .22, p = .41).
Conclusions: Intervening with parents of pediatric cancer survivors
seems to provide scaffolding that can help children improve BF. Early
interventions focused on improving EF for cancer patients should be
explored so as to provide a solid foundation for bolstering behavior.

C. CHENG & H.M. CONKLIN. The Utility of Parent Report in
Predicting Future Neurocognitive Outcomes in Very Young
Survivors of Childhood Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL)
Treated with Chemotherapy Only.
Objective: Neurobehavioral late effects of therapy may be amenable
to early intervention; however, performance-based assessment during
therapy is challenging, particularly with very young children. In this
preliminary analysis, we examined whether parent ratings during therapy predicted end-of-therapy neurocognitive problems.
Participants and Methods: Parents of 107 children (52% males, 67%
Low Risk, age at diagnosis: M=3.0, SD=1.0, range=0.7-4.8 years) rated
executive function, behavior, and adaptive skills early during therapy.
Logistic regression was used to determine if ratings predicted problems
on end-of-therapy neurocognitive testing conducted roughly 29 months
later.
Results: Parents rated increased frequency of problems (score ≥ 1 SD
from the population mean) on the BRIEF Working Memory (28%),
Plan-Organize (25%), and Emotional Control (24%) scales, the BASC-2
Anxiety (25%) and Somatization (44%) scales, and the ABAS-II SelfCare scale (51%; ps ≤.01). At end-of-therapy testing, an increased
frequency of survivors had problems with sustained attention (CPT2;
30-49%), Emotional Control (31%), Working Memory (34%), processing speed (WJ-COG Decision Speed, 28%) and reading (WJ-III
Letter-Word Identification, 27%), compared to normative data (ps

Forty Fourth Annual INS Meeting Abstracts
≤.01). End-of-therapy outcomes did not differ by treatment intensity.
Children with anxiety problems during therapy had increased risk of
end-of-therapy problems with processing speed (OR=4.9, [95%CI, 1.0223.77]). Concerns with Emotional Control during therapy predicted
increased risk for problems in this domain at end-of-therapy (3.85,
[1.05-14.12]; ps ≤.05).
Conclusions: Young children treated for ALL are at risk for neurobehavioral concerns that emerge early and are detectable at the end of
therapy. Contrary to prior research, we found that treatment intensity
did not mediate risk, emphasizing the need to monitor all young children. Parent ratings may be useful for monitoring, as concerns during
therapy were moderately predictive of increased risk for end-of-therapy
problems.

S. NA, T.Z. KING, R. MORRIS & B. SUN. BOLD Activity in Adult
Survivors of Childhood Brain Tumors Following Continued
Exposure on a Working Memory Task.
Objective: Behavioral studies have documented impaired working
memory in childhood brain tumor survivors and the neural foundations
for these deficits are starting to be identified using fMRI. To explore a
potentially more sensitive measure of difference between survivors and
healthy peers, changes in brain activation over time were examined.
Short-term effects of continued exposure on a working memory task
were investigated in survivors on average 14 years post diagnosis.
Participants and Methods: Functional magnetic resonance imaging
was utilized to evaluate BOLD activity in twenty adult survivors (age
M=23.1; F=55%) and twenty age- and gender-matched controls at the
beginning (first two runs) and end (last two runs) of a twenty minute 5-run n-back letter recall task with pseudo-randomized task order
among runs. An F-test was conducted on the [3-back>0-back] contrast
to determine effects of group and time.
Results: Although there were no signs of behavioral improvement over
time, reductions in BOLD signal were demonstrated in left prefrontal
(Brodmann Area 8) and left premotor regions (BA 6) over time in both
groups. The main effect of group was also present, with adult survivors
recruiting bilateral prefrontal (including the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex; DLPFC) and parietal regions of the brain to higher degrees than
controls during the course of the entire task.
Conclusions: Findings suggest that adult survivors of pediatric brain
tumor may require increased cognitive control (i.e., top-down processing
and attentional control in the DLPFC) during working memory tasks
and that activation in the DLPFC did not decline over time. In addition,
both groups similarly recruited left prefrontal and premotor regions of
the brain at the beginning of the task; these regions became less activated with exposure over time in the absence of statistically significant
task performance change. These results suggest that dynamic changes
in the brain occur even within the course of a twenty minute task.

Neuropsychological Functioning at Baseline and at least 2 Years
Post Cranial Proton Radiation Therapy.
Objective: Proton radiation therapy (PRT) improves the targeting of
tumor tissue. Cranial PRT should reduce radiation-related morbidity
for pediatric brain tumor patients (PBTP). Little prospective research
has evaluated PRT in PBTP. This study describes neuropsychological
functioning after pediatric cranial PRT.
Participants and Methods: 15 PBTP (11 male), age 2 to 16yrs (M=8.4,
SD=4.6) completed evaluations pre-PRT and at least 2 years post-PRT
(off-treatment). PBTP included 9 tumor types with many pre-existing

133
conditions (e.g., Autism, learning disability, stroke, visual impairment)
and were compared by location (8 infratentorial), PRT field (9 focal;
4500-5940cGy) and age (7 over 9yrs at baseline). Assessment included
intellectual (Wechsler), memory (CMS, WRAML2, CVLT), processing
speed (Wechsler), motor/visual-motor (PPT, Beery), attention (TEACh,
CCPT2) and executive (DKEFS, RCFT, TOLDx) abilities.
Results: No significant change over time identified for FSIQ, VIQ, PIQ,
memory (CMS, CVLT), or motor (PPT) ability. Paired samples t-tests
revealed significant decline in Coding (d=1.09, p<.05) and improvement in Word Generation (d=-0.97, p<.05). Only Coding consistently
declined over time when dividing cohort by age (over 9yrs; d=1.25),
tumor location (infratentorial; d=1.18), and PRT field (ventricle/craniospinal; d=2.19) all ps<.05. At follow-up, mean performance was
average for intelligence, attention, problem solving, visual memory and
story memory. Visual scanning time and list learning was low average
(TEACh, CVLT) with motor/graphomotor abilities impaired (PPT,
Beery VP+MC).
Conclusions: In context of small sample size, minimal neuropsychological change was evident 2 to 4 years post-PRT. General neuropsychological functioning is preserved with relative weakness in visual
scanning and list learning. PBTPs with diverse medical/psychological
backgrounds demonstrate impaired motor/graphomotor abilities. Ongoing research with larger PRT cohorts is needed to describe PBTP
functioning post-PRT.

J. PETERSEN, S. AMEDORO & C.L. ARMSTRONG. Late-Delayed
Effects on Verbal and Visual Memory from Photon Radiotherapy
for Pediatric Brain Tumors.
Objective: This prospective, longitudinal study examines the late-delayed effects (<6 years) of standard photon radiotherapy (XRT) on
memory in children and adolescents with mixed brain tumors. XRT is
the conventional treatment for many types of brain tumors, but a brief,
clinically effective cognitive marker of resulting toxicity is still needed
in children because it will be more feasible to follow treatment effects
overtime. We hypothesize verbal and visual memory to be differential
indicators of cognitive toxicity resulting from XRT, as both hippocampal
and total white matter volumes show reductions following XRT.
Participants and Methods: Participants included 37 patients with
mixed primary brain tumors (19 males; age range: 4-22, M=10, SD=4).
All patients completed baseline and at least one follow-up assessment.
Verbal memory was assessed using the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning
Test (encoding, retrieval after interference, and retrieval after a delay).
A complex figure test and picture recognition measured visual memory.
Immediate free recall, delayed free recall, and speed and accuracy of
recognition were analyzed. Analyses used age-referenced Z scores in
a nonlinear regression, with age predicting variability index scores. A
one-way ANOVA examined the times points at which patients varied
and a regression mapped the general pattern of change.
Results: Our results provide some support for the use of verbal and
visual memory as markers of cognitive toxicity resulting from XRT.
However, as sensitive as these measures of the late-delayed effects of
XRT appear, further research of cognitive change is needed.
Conclusions: Understanding the time course of injury from XRT is
needed for multi-disciplinary treatment and rehabilitation. Neuropsychological evaluation of the late-delayed cognitive effects of XRT, particularly verbal and visual memory, will inform treatment teams from
a variety of disciplines, and promote appropriate supports throughout
recovery.

Z. TAIWO, S. NA & T.Z. KING. The Neurological Predictor Scale
Is Associated with Long-term Core Cognitive Outcomes in Adult
Survivors of Childhood Brain Tumors.
Objective: Prior research has demonstrated the reliability and validity of the Neurological Predictor Scale (NPS) in relation to short- and
long-term intellectual and adaptive outcomes for childhood brain tumor survivors. However, the concurrent validity of the NPS with core
cognitive skills has yet to be examined. The current study examines
the concurrent validity of the NPS with long-term cognitive outcomes
relative to individual variables alone.
Participants and Methods: Sixty one adulthood survivors of childhood
brain cancers (M age=24 years, SD=6), on average 16 years post diagnosis completed neuropsychological assessments examining attention
(Wechsler Memory Scale Digit Span Forward raw), processing speed
(Symbol Digit Modalities Test z-score) and working memory (Auditory
Consonant Trigrams 36 second delay z-score). NPS scores were computed from data acquired from medical records. Hierarchical regressions
were conducted to evaluate whether NPS accounted for a significant
amount of variance above and beyond the contributions of individual
treatment and illness-related variables (i.e., presence or absence of radiation, chemotherapy, neurosurgery, hydrocephalus, hormone deficiency
and seizure medications).
Results: NPS was significantly associated with processing speed (R2
= .214, p<.05) and working memory (R2 = .204, p<.05) outcomes
over and above each each individual risk factor. NPS was significantly
associated with attention outcomes after covarying for age (R2 = .092,
p<.05) over and above each risk factor except presence of hormone
deficiency and chemotherapy. These two variables were not significantly
associated with cognitive outcomes.
Conclusions: These findings demonstrate the concurrent validity between the NPS and core cognitive outcomes. The NPS may be an informative clinical research tool especially in studies with heterogeneous
brain tumor samples.

Objective: Conventional radiation therapy for brain tumors is associated with cognitive sequelae (e.g., executive dysfunction) and reduced
quality of life (QL). Proton radiotherapy (PRT), which limits dose to
normal tissue, may improve outcome. Executive functioning (EF) and
QL at follow-up were examined in PRT pediatric patients.
Participants and Methods: 61 patients (M=12.6 yrs; SD=3.6) were
evaluated >1 year PRT (M=3.10 yrs, Range=1.00-8.83). 52% were
infratentorial tumors; 44% medulloblastoma; 49% whole brain radiation; 85% resection; 71% chemotherapy. Measures were: Wechsler
intelligence scale, Continuous Performance Test-II, Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Functioning (Global Executive Composite-GEC,
Parent), Behavior Assessment System for Children-2 Attention scale
(Parent), and Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory 4.0 (Child/Parent)
Total (PedsQL-T) and School Functioning (PedsQL-SF); higher QL
scores indicate better QL (at-risk for impaired QL<69.7).
Results: Full Scale IQ, sustained attention, working memory (WM),
and GEC were average. Processing speed (PS) was low average. Mean
PedsQL-T was 79.7 (Child) and 74.1 (Parent); Mean PedsQL-SF was
73.0 (Child) and 65.4 (Parent). Parent/Child PedsQL scores were correlated (p<.01); although parents reported greater problems. Poorer
WM and PS were related to lower PedsQL-T (Parent/Child) (p<.05).
PedsQL-SF (Parent/Child) was correlated with all attention and EF
measures (p<.05). Whole brain PRT had lower PS, WM, and PedsQL-T/
PedsQL-SF (Parent).
Conclusions: 3 years after PRT, IQ, attention, WM and EF in everyday
life were intact. PS was low average. Parent and child reported QL were
below norms for healthy children and at risk for impaired QL in school
functioning (Parent). Poorer attention/EF scores were significantly

related to lower Total and School QL. Screening for attention/EF deficits
should be conducted to identify patients vulnerable to reduced QL. Proactive EF support should be provided to PRT patients to promote QL.

& P.A. GANZ. Cognitive Complaints in Breast Cancer Survivors
(BCS): Association with Mood and Cognition.
Objective: Among breast cancer patients, risk for post-treatment cognitive difficulties is a survivorship concern. Self-reported cognitive
complaints in BCS are subtle and variably associated with cognitive
functioning and mood; questionnaires that discriminate between complaints associated with cognitive dysfunction vs. mood would inform
appropriate intervention. The Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy – Cognitive Function (FACT-Cog) is a multidimensional self-report
instrument measuring cognitive strengths with the Perceived Cognitive
Ability (PCA) scale, weaknesses with the Perceived Cognitive Impairment (PCI) scale, and Cognitive Quality of Life (QoL); few studies have
examined its association with cognition and mood.
Participants and Methods: 103 BCS (mean age = 56.81 ± 7.91, mean
years since treatment = 4.44 ± .66) were evaluated with a neuropsychological battery; the Beck Depression Inventory, 2nd edition (BDI-II), and
FACT-Cog (higher scores = better ratings). Three hierarchical linear
regressions were performed with PCA, PCI, or QOL as the dependent
variable, BDI-II, and Memory and Attention cognitive domain scores
as predictors, controlling for age and IQ. FACT-Cog scores were then
compared between groups of those with Depression and intact Memory
(D; BDI-II≥14; n=17), Memory Impairment (z<-.5) with or without Depression (M±D; n=17), or Neither depression nor impairment (N; n=69).
Results: All final models were significant (p<.05); both the BDI-II (β
=-.46) and the Memory domain (β=.24) were significant predictors
of PCA, whereas the BDI-II was the only significant predictor of PCI
(β =-.65) and QOL (β =-.71). The D group had the lowest PCI scores
(p<.05); M±D and D groups had lower PCA and QOL than the N group,
but weren’t different from each other.
Conclusions: The FACT-Cog scales are differentially sensitive to mood
and objective cognitive function. The FACT-Cog may be helpful for
identifying BCS who may benefit from mood or cognition-related clinical services.

S.A. CASTELLON, A.F. LEUCHTER & P.A. GANZ. Resting State
EEG, Depression, and Memory in Breast Cancer Survivors (BCS).
Objective: Self-reported cancer-related cognitive decline (CRCD) in
BCS correlates variably with objective decline as well as mood. Resting-state quantitative EEG (qEEG) may be informative for investigating
physiological correlates of mood and cognitive performance and exploring the “accelerated aging” hypothesis of CRCD.
Participants and Methods: We assessed depression severity (Beck Depression Inventory, BDI-II), neuropsychological test performance (Memory domain), and neurophysiologic function (qEEG) in a cross-sectional
analysis of 62 BCS (mean age = 57.40±8.39, mean years post-treatment
= 4.42±0.61). Analyses included: 1) partial correlations controlling for
age between qEEG measures (i.e., qEEG cordance, relative anteroposterior (AP) gradient) and memory and depression scores; 2) ANOVA and
Bonferroni-corrected post-hoc tests of qEEG measures among 3 groups:
Memory Impaired (M; z<-.5;n=10); Depressed (D; BDI-II≥14;n=12); or
Neither (N;n=40).
Results: Memory domain scores correlated with qEEG relative theta
AP gradient (r=.26,p<.05), and with a trend towards prefrontal theta
cordance (r=.24,p=.06). BDI-II score correlated with relative theta AP

Forty Fourth Annual INS Meeting Abstracts
gradient (r=-.30,p=.02), relative delta AP gradient (p=-.251,p=.05),
and prefrontal (.45,p<.01) and global (.-.323,p=.01) alpha cordance.
The D group had greater prefrontal alpha cordance and lower anterior
delta and theta power vs. N, and greater posterior beta power vs. M
and N (p’s<.05). A group difference trend for prefrontal theta cordance
showed lower power in the M vs. N group (p=.09).
Conclusions: qEEG measures appear to be differentially sensitive to
memory performance and depression symptoms in BCS, and may be
useful biomarkers of these factors in CRCD. Our findings are consistent
with emerging evidence that higher resting-state theta power may indicate successful cognitive aging (Vlahou et al., 2014), relevant to the
“accelerated aging” model of CRCD.

S. WISE, G. DOME, A. GIOIA, I. TAORMINA, K. OLSON, N. WINICK
& K.K. HARDY. Rates of Neuropsychological Impairment among
Children Being Treated for High-Risk Acute Lymphoblastic
Leukemia.
Objective: Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) is associated with
increased risk for neuropsychological late effects; however, less is known
about the onset, timing, and trajectory of deficits. Our objective was to
examine rates of impairment at multiple timepoints over the course of
chemotherapy in High-Risk ALL patients being treated on Children’s
Oncology Group (COG) protocol AALL1131.
Participants and Methods: The sample includes children aged 6-11
years enrolled on a COG trial for newly-diagnosed patients with highrisk ALL. At five timepoints between the end of Consolidation throughout Maintenance, participants (n=265) complete five tasks from the
CogState battery, a brief computerized neuropsychological assessment.
In addition, parents complete the BRIEF. We then identified the percentage of patients with scores of clinical concern on each measure (i.e.,
CogState Standard Score ≤85; BRIEF T-score ≥65) at each timepoint.
Results: 265 out of 376 (70.4%) eligible patients consented to the study
(51.9% female, mean age at diagnosis=9.3 years; SD=1.83). Approximately three months after diagnosis (Time 1), 39% of participants
exhibited a deficit on at least one of the five CogState tasks and 22%
showed elevations on at least one of four scores of interest on the BRIEF;
18% and 14% showed more than one abnormal score on each measure,
respectively. After two years of therapy, participants exhibited similar
rates of abnormal CogState scores, with most low scores occurring for
the processing speed (23%) and sustained attention (21%) tasks. In
addition, 23% showed elevations on at least 2 of 4 scales on the BRIEF.
Conclusions: Children being treated for HR-ALL appear to exhibit
higher rates of parent-reported and performance-based executive dysfunction compared to population-based expectations. Our study adds
to the existing literature by demonstrating the evolution of problems
with processing speed and attention as they emerge over the course of
treatment.

Cross Cultural
J. ALI & B. POTTER. Challenges in Cross-cultural
Neuropsychological Consultation: a Case Study of a Non-verbal
Guatemalan Immigrant.
Objective: Immigrant youth comprise one-quarter of the children in
the US, and are projected to make up one-third of children in the US
by 2050. The increased diversity of the youth in the US places greater
emphasis and demand for culturally-sensitive neuropsychological services. The fields of psychology and neuropsychology have made many
advances with regard to multicultural treatment, consultation and

135
assessment. Despite these advances, significant challenges continue,
particularly related to the impact of cultural or economic disadvantages
on access to neuropsychological services. Thus, the purpose of the case
study was to describe some of the challenges and barriers associated with
a neuropsychological consultation with a non-verbal Guatemalan youth.
Participants and Methods: The current case examines a 12-year-old,
non-verbal, Guatemalan male who was referred for a neuropsychological consultation due to developmental delay and a reported untreated,
remote, non-accidental traumatic brain injury. Relevant information
was obtained via review of available medical and educational records
and through a clinical interview with his mother (who speaks Quiché)
with the assistance of an interpreter.
Results: This case study exemplified many of the challenges related to
cross-cultural neuropsychological consultation and assessment. Notably, this case emphasized role of neuropsychologists as an intermediary
between immigrant clients and available resources and community services, and highlighted the limitations of the current medical system to
assist persons without insurance and other associated cultural barriers.
Conclusions: Neuropsychologists need to be keenly aware of cultural
barriers that impact the patient before, during, and after consultation.
Assisting with communication, and understanding the specific cultural
needs and barriers of the patient played an important role in ensuring
the patient received appropriate care.

J. AVILA, J. RAZANI & S.P. VERNEY. Differential Reading
Achievement-IQ Associations Across Ethnic Groups.
Objective: Reading achievement scores are often used to estimate
premorbid IQ because these skills are correlated with IQ scores and
generally resistant to neurological dysfunction. However, sociocultural
and educational experiences may mitigate this reading-IQ relationship.
The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between
reading achievement and IQ scores across four different ethnic groups.
Participants and Methods: Adult participants aged 18-71 years were
recruited into four ethnic groups, Hispanic (HI; n=48), Asian (AS;
n=56), Middle Eastern (ME; n=80), and monolingual English-speaking
European Americans (MESEA; n=81). Participants completed WRAT-3
(reading subtest) and the WASI-II (FSIQ, VIQ, and PIQ) and demographic questionnaires.
Results: Three hierarchical multiple regressions were conducted on each
ethnic group separately, with FSIQ, VIQ, and PIQ as the DVs. After
accounting for age, gender (step 1), and SES (step 2), the addition of
WRAT scores resulted in significant R2 changes in the AS (R2=7.2%),
ME (R2=23%), and MESEA (R2=24.8%) models, but not in the HI
model (R2=6.8%). Results for VIQ and PIQ, following a similar pattern,
varied across groups. To further investigate the variability found in
the WRAT reading and IQ associations, bivariate correlations revealed
different associations across groups between WRAT and IQ scores and
demographic/cultural variables (i.e., age, gender, years of education,
SES, bilingualism, immigrant status, years living in the US, and education in the US).
Conclusions: These findings suggest the relationship between reading achievement and IQ may not be consistent across different ethnic groups. Demographic/cultural variables affect both sides of the
WRAT-IQ equation, likely changing the nature of this association.
Failure to examine and account for the effect of sociocultural contexts
on the reading achievement–IQ relationship may result in inaccurate
prediction of premorbid intellectual ability.

Fagan Test to Assess Neurocognitive Development in Rural
Ugandan Infants Exposed to HIV.
Objective: The Fagan test of infant intelligence uses gaze length for
familiar and unfamiliar human faces to gauge working memory in infants. A modified Fagan test was used with an automated eye-tracking
instrument to measure infant gaze length favoring unfamiliar compared
to familiar faces in children born to Ugandan mothers with HIV.
Participants and Methods: A modified Fagan test was administered
to 31 HIV-exposed Ugandan infants 6 to 12 months of age (11 boys;
M=0.69 yrs, SD=0.14; 20 girls; M=0.79, SD=0.15). A series of faces are
presented in a repeated pattern for a fixed presentation length throughout a six-minute video (unknown Face 1 is presented for 25 seconds,
followed by 15 seconds where the now familiar Face 1 is presented with
unfamiliar Face 2). We programmed a Tobii X2-30 infrared camera for
pupil direction for an automated eye-tracking measure of gaze location
and length in response to digitized photographs of local Ugandan faces
selected to correspond to the gender, age (adult, child), face expression,
and orientation of the original series of Fagan test faces. We correlated
modified Fagan test performance to performance on the Mullen Scales
of Early Learning (MSEL).
Results: Infants spent significantly more time gazing at the novel picture
than familiar over 10 novelty preference trials (t=9.17, P<0.001). Boys
tended to look at the faces longer than girls (t=1.98, P=0.06). The MSEL
was correlated with overall time spent looking at all faces (r=0.52,
P=0.004). The MSEL Fine Motor scale, which measures visual-spatial
working memory requiring a motor response, was correlated with gaze
length at novel faces (r=0.40, P=0.03), gaze length at familiar faces
(r=0.38, P=0.04), and overall gaze length during for all faces (r=0.54,
P=0.002).
Conclusions: Our modified Fagan test is a sensitive working memory
measure predictive of overall infant/child development. Use of eye scanning technologies in infants provides a neurocognitive outcome for evaluating risk and resilience in low-resource settings for at-risk children.

the Sensitivity of an Early Childhood Vigilance Test (ECVT) of
Attention in Ugandan Children Perinatally Exposed to HIV.
Objective: We evaluated automated eye tracking technology for enhancing the sensitivity of the Early Childhood Vigilance Test (ECVT)
of attention with younger children perinatally exposed to HIV in rural
Uganda. We also evaluated whether this technology could enable the
ECVT to correlate better with a color-object association test (COAT) of
memory and learning and the Mullen Scales of Early Learning (MSEL).
Participants and Methods: 44 children were evaluated with the ECVT,
COAT, and MSEL (24 boys M=52.3 SD=11.4 months of age; 20 girls
M=52.4, SD=12.2). The ECVT attention measure is the proportion of
time a child looks at the monitor during 7 min cartoon video. The ECVT
was scored from a computer monitor webcam scored for % time the
child spent looking using PROCODER. A Tobii X2-30 portable camera
was also programmed to automatically record the child’s pupil direction
during the cartoon to calculate % time watching.
Results: Children watched 78% of the cartoon using Tobii automated
eye tracking, while PROCODER webcam scoring resulted in an average
of 67% (r=0.84, P<0.001). Older children performed better on the
ECVT (r=0.41, P=0.008), although no gender differences were observed. ECVT Tobii eye tracking significantly correlated with COAT
immediate recall for color-object associations (tracking moving animals
r=0.33, P=0.019; total percent time screen gaze r=0.31, P=0.035), and

with MSEL Fine Motor performance (visual-spatial learning with motor
response; r=0.33, P=0.037). ECVT webcam PROCODER % was also
significantly correlated with COAT memory (r=0.42, P=0.005) and
learning (r=0.38, P=0.011), but not with MSEL Fine Motor.
Conclusions: Enhancing the sensitivity of the ECVT by using automated eye tracking technology efficiently improves correspondence
with other visual-spatial measures of working memory and learning in
Ugandan children perinatally exposed to HIV. Eye tracking technology has the potential of improving the validity and reliability of other
neurocognitive measures in at-risk African children in clinical settings.

K. BOYER, C. RYAN & C. VEGA. Assessment of Arabic-speaking
international patients: Experience from a Pediatric Epilepsy
Center.
Objective: Practice of neuropsychology increasingly demands understanding of cross-cultural variables that impact assessment, with educational and linguistic diversity being at the forefront. More subtly,
culture also affects engagement in the assessment, and can result in
departure from standardization practices designed primarily for Western cultures. We have experienced an increase in referrals from Arabic-speaking countries, and have adapted assessment strategies to better
serve this population.
Participants and Methods: Retrospective review of patients from Arabic-speaking countries referred from 2013-2015 included 17 patients
(one seen twice), age range 2 to 17 years. Sixty-five percent were referred as part of epilepsy surgery evaluation. Assessment strategy is reviewed. General cognitive ability and descriptive analyses are provided.
Results: Less than half of the evaluations included a test of verbal IQ
or language (Bilingual Verbal Abilities Test completed on 28%); no
tests of verbal memory were employed. Nonverbal IQ was measured
with the Wechsler scales (67%) or the DAS-2 (4/18). Preschool and
older patients also completed tests of visual-motor integration (13/16)
and fine motor dexterity (11/16), while younger patients completed the
Bayley-III. Fifteen patients likely met criteria for intellectual disability.
Thirteen were recently or currently enrolled in school. Mean parent
education was 14.4 years.
Conclusions: Assessment methods relied heavily on interview and observations with tools selected for cultural and developmental appropriateness. Referral questions regarding language and memory function
were typically not addressed with diagnostic tests. Consultation between
colleagues regarding cultural communication was highly valuable and
yielded multiple observations that improved assessment practices for
subsequent evaluations. Notably, awareness of inter-gender communication and parenting practices among Arabic cultures enhanced clinical
intervention with families.

Ability Affects BNT Item Difficulty in a Rural Adult Sample.
Objective: Item response theory (IRT) with a single factor Confirmatory
Factor Analysis (CFA) was used to examine individual item difficulty
on the Boston Naming Test (BNT) as a function of premorbid ability.
Participants and Methods: Participants consisted of a consecutive
clinical sample of 849 adults at a rural academic medical center. Factor
analysis was used as a data reduction technique to create a regression factor based on education and reading level (WRAT-4). A median
split was used to separate the sample into groups of higher (Education
M=15.11, SD=2.37; WRAT-4 M=103.66, SD=11.44) and lower (Education M=11.44, SD=1.56; WRAT-4 M=85.02, SD=9.23) premorbid

abilities. IRT with a single factor, two group CFA was used to observe
variations in item difficulty based on the regression factor.
Results: The best fitting model was the two group metric invariance
single factor CFA, and exhibited excellent goodness of fit (e.g., RMSEA
= 0.016, CFI = 0.989, TLI = 0.988). Item difficulties were greater for
the lower education/reading level group. Chi-Square tests for percent
correct were significantly different for all but two items (funnel, latch),
and there was a 20% difference on half of the items. The following items
had the greatest item difficulty discrepancies (reporting percent correct
of lower versus higher Premorbid Ability group): abacus (9% vs 41%),
palette (20% vs 53%), accordion (46% vs 73%), stethoscope (71% vs
94%), protractor (18% vs 41%), and compass (27% vs 51%).
Conclusions: In a large rural clinical sample, premorbid ability substantially affects BNT performance, especially for the more difficult
items. Therefore, premorbid schooling is important to consider when
interpreting performance on BNT items. Standardized scores derived
from norms that do not consider premorbid background (educational
attainment and reading level) may overestimate naming difficulties in
individuals with lower premorbid abilities, which could lead to over-interpreting word-finding problems.

C. CARRION, N. PLISKIN, A. THOMAS & L.H. LU. Measures of
Executive Functioning as Predictors of Adaptive Functioning in a
Hispanic Sample with Limited English Proficiency.
Objective: Cognitive and behavioral measures of executive functioning
(EF) positively predict adaptive functioning, but these findings have yet
to be demonstrated in limited English proficiency (LEP) Hispanics who
often have limited educational attainment (Farias, Mungas, Hinton, &
Haan, 2011; Karzmark et al., 2012). We examined the extent to which
the Frontal Systems Behavior Scale (FrSBe; Grace & Malloy, 2001),
when combined with measures of EF, improve our ability to predict
adaptive functioning in LEP Hispanics.
Participants and Methods: Archival data from 35 Hispanic individuals with LEP who completed a full set of EF measures [Stroop (SCWT),
Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST), Verbal Fluency, Color Trails
(CTT)] were analyzed [mean age=60.86, SD=14.17; mean education
7.40, SD=3.43].
Results: Using listwise deletion, the WCST emerged as a superior predictor of adaptive functioning as measured by instrumental activities of
daily living (IADL) (WCST r=-.33, p=.04; SCWT r=-.02, p=.47; Verbal
Fluency r=.10, p=.31; CTT r=-.042, p=.41). All four FrSBe scores including Apathy (A), Disinhibition (D), EF, and Total scale significantly
predicted IADL (A r=-.69, p<.01; D r=-.47, p<.01; EF r=-.62, p<.01;
Total r=-.45, p<.01). Hierarchical regression including demographic
variables in Step 1 (age, sex, education), WCST in Step 2, and the FrSBe
Total in Step 3 revealed that the overall model explained 35.6% of the
variance in IADL scores. Neither demographic nor cognitive variables
contributed to the IADL variance. Adding the FrSBe Total increased the
variance explained by 32.4% (adjusted R2=.245; F(5,29)=3.21, p<.05).
Conclusions: Findings suggest that informant reports of executive functioning predict functional decline for LEP Hispanics. These results differ
from previous findings in which executive dysfunction was found to be
the strongest predictor of adaptive functioning in an English-speaking
sample (Karzmark et al., 2012).

C.M. FUNES, C. CLENDINEN, J. RAZANI, F.C. GOLDSTEIN &
R. MORRIS. The Impact of Explicit Strategy Instruction on the
Verbal Learning Outcomes of English- and Spanish-speaking
Older Adults.
Objective: This study investigated learning strategy use and overall
memory performance of healthy, Spanish-speaking older adults and
English-speaking older adults. It explored the possibility that the novelty
of verbal memory tasks, along with demographic differences, may lead
to differences in Spanish-speaking elders’ effective use of organizational
strategies. It was hypothesized that added instruction would reduce
differences in effective strategy use and overall performance observed
between the Latino and Caucasian groups.
Participants and Methods: Forty-eight healthy, Spanish-speaking
older adults of Hispanic/Latino descent and 55 healthy, English-speaking Caucasian older adults were administered list-learning tasks in their
dominant language. One list was administered using standard task instruction while a second list provided explicit detail on how to use the
effective semantic clustering strategy.
Results: Under standard task instruction, Spanish-speaking older adults
with low levels of formal education learned fewer words on the task than
Caucasian and Latino participants who had higher levels of education. Latino participants, regardless of educational levels, also utilized
semantic clustering recall at lower rates than Caucasian participants.
When provided with explicit strategy instructions, both groups showed
reduced total list learning. Latino elders also demonstrated reduced
response to strategy manipulation compared to Caucasian participants.
Finally, in the Latino sample, the quality of their formal education and
level of acculturation were identified as important predictors of verbal
learning outcomes.
Conclusions: These findings highlight the need to continue to examine the complex role of demographic and cultural variables on verbal
learning and memory processes, as they may impact the assessment of
pathological processes, as well the development of effective cognitive
interventions for diverse elders.

K.A. HOLLER, B.C. KAVANAUGH, J. DUPONT-FRECHETTE,
P. TELLOCK, I. MAHER & L. HAISLEY. The Role of Cultural Bias:
Childhood Intellectual Performance in a Psychiatric Inpatient
Sample.
Objective: Cultural bias (CB) can significantly influence neuropsychological evaluation results, potentially leading to inaccurate or skewed
conclusions regarding brain-behavior relationships. This study examined the influence of cultural bias on intellectual testing performance
within a children’s psychiatric inpatient setting.
Participants and Methods: A medical chart review was conducted for
103 children aged 6-13 years with at least one psychiatric disorder who
received a neuropsychological evaluation during a psychiatric inpatient
program hospitalization from 2010-2014. CB risk was assessed via each
child’s minority status (white/ non-white), insurance status (public/
private), and school ranking (high/low state ranking). A total CB risk
score (0-4) as calculated for each child based on the sum of CB risk factors. Intellectual functioning (IQ) was assessed as full-scale intelligence
(FSIQ), verbal IQ (VCI), and perceptual IQ (PRI).
Results: FSIQ, VCI, and PRI all correlated significantly with at least
one CB risk factor. Multiple regression analyses found that the total CB
risk score accounted for a statistically significant amount of variance
in FSIQ and VCI performance, but not PRI performance. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis revealed that the total CB risk
score was able to distinguish between intact versus low VCI (< 1 SD),
identifying a cut-score of 2 as the optimal cut-point for detecting CB
risk. ANOVAs found differences in VCI between those with 0, 1, 2, and
3 CB risk factors, with approximately 14 VCI points separating those
with 0 CB risk factors from those with 3 risk factors.

138
Conclusions: Results indicate that CB risk has a significant and cummulative influence on verbal IQ but not perceptual IQ performance in
children. In order to avoid inaccurate conclusions regarding brain-behavior relationships, the assessment of cultural bias risk should be a
core component of all pediatric intellectual and neuropsychological
evaluations.

C. LUONG-TRAN, L. KENWORTHY, C. ROTHWELL, A. RATTO &
L.G. ANTHONY. Differences in Executive Functions and Behaviors
of Asian and Caucasian Children.
Objective: Compare EF and behaviors of Asian-American and Caucasian children.
Participants and Methods: Data from participants evaluated at an
outpatient neuropsychology clinic between 2014-15 were drawn from
an IRB-approved clinical database. 39 Asian and 39 Caucasian children
were matched by primary diagnosis (48.7% ASD, 28.2% no diagnosis,
17.9% ADHD, 2.6% language disorder, 2.6% neurocognitive disorder),
age (3.6-19 years), gender (74.4% male), and nonverbal IQ (M=92.79,
SD=19.12). Parents and teachers completed the BRIEF and CBCL.
Objective tests included Wechsler scales, DAS, TEA-Ch and Tower of
London.
Results: Independent samples t-tests indicated that parents of Caucasian children reported greater concerns with global EF (t(71)=-2.087,
p<.05) and organization (t(54)=-2.284, p<.01) than parents of Asian
children. Similar trends were found in teacher BRIEF data. Parents
of Caucasian children also reported greater concerns on the CBCL for
Anxiety/Depression (t(70)=-2.092, p<.05), Aggression (t(71)=-2.718,
p<.01), Externalizing (t(71)=-2.279, p<.05), and Oppositional (t(71)=2.164, p<.05). No differences found in objective tests. Further analyses
indicated group differences were primarily in reports made by parents/
teachers of children with ASD. Caucasian children with ASD were more
likely reported to have problems with inhibition, plan/org, and global
EF on the BRIEF, and aggression and ext/int behaviors on the CBCL.
Conclusions: There are clear differences in parent/teacher reports of
EF dysfunction and behaviors between Asian/Caucasian students, while
objective tests are similar. This may be related to differences in cultural
perception of problems or differences in the manifestation of problems.
Furthermore, these perceptual differences were more prominent for children with ASD in this study and may be due to cultural differences in
attribution of observed behaviors or manifestation of behaviors. This is
the first study to examine these factors. Further research and analysis
is needed to confirm these findings.

K.A. MUSIELAK, J. FINE & M.J. BOIVIN. Effects of Mediational
Intervention for Sensitizing Caregivers (MISC) and a Health
and Nutrition Education Program on the Sustained Attention of
Ugandan Children with HIV.
Objective: Children with HIV may experience difficulties with sustained
attention. The current study examined the effects of two caregiver intervention programs, the Mediational Intervention for Sensitizing Caregivers (MISC) and a health and nutrition education (HNE) program, on the
sustained attention of Ugandan children with HIV. It was hypothesized
that both interventions would improve sustained attention, but that
MISC would be associated with greater improvements than HNE. It was
also hypothesized that one year of intervention would lead to greater
gains than six months of intervention.
Participants and Methods: 111 Ugandan HIV-positive children ages
2 to 5 years old and their primary caregivers were randomized by geographic cluster to MISC or HNE. Caregivers in both groups participated
in biweekly intervention sessions for one year and received monthly

food packages. Children completed the Early Childhood Vigilance Test
(ECVT) of sustained attention at baseline, six months into the intervention, and at the end of the intervention year. Mixed-effects modeling
was used to examine the effects of the two intervention groups and how
the length of the interventions influenced sustained attention skills.
Results: Both groups made significant gains in sustained attention
during the yearlong intervention (p < .05), but there was no significant
difference between the gains made by the two intervention groups. In
both groups, significant gains were observed only during the second
six-month period (p < .05).
Conclusions: This study highlights the potential benefits of interventions addressing health, nutrition, and caregiver-child interactions for
children with HIV. The full year of intervention may be necessary for
significant gains in sustained attention. This study provides a foundation
for future research to examine additional questions surrounding interventions that promote sustained attention growth in children with HIV.

H. KAUR, A. NEHRA, S. CHOPRA & V. SREENIVAS. Are we getting
Smarter? Generational change of cognitive test performance in
India.
Objective: Neuropsychological evaluation ascertains intact or impaired
cognitive abilities & establishes a marker to assess the progress of pharmacological, surgical, rehabilitation efforts, & the course of cerebral
dysfunction & recovery. This is done by careful interpretation of performance of the individual on a wide range of standardized tests. Widely
used neuropsychological evaluation for memory is the Post Graduate
Institute Memory Scale (PGI-MS) developed in 1976 to assess ten domains of memory. Its relatively quick test which can also be used for
illiterates with different age and education based norms. The objective
was to see the evidence of Flynn Effect (FE) in memory functioning.
Participants and Methods: Normative sample of 305 consenting individuals constituted our cross-sectional study design. People with 0-5,
6-9 and more than 10 years of education matching the earlier age range
i.e. from 20 to 69 years were evaluated on PGIMS.
Results: In 0-5 years of education FE is seen in recent memory, temporal sequencing, delayed & immediate recall. In 6- 9 years of education
FE is seen in attention, remote & recent memory, delayed & immediate
recall, new learning ability & visual retention. More than 10 years of
education FE is seen in attention, delayed & immediate recall. Across
different education levels such significant changes are seen in different
age ranges. The cognitive abilities for people between 20-69 years, on
the basis of previous norms are an underestimate of their present abilities. Present generation with 0-5 and 6-9 years of education perform
better in their cognitive abilities as compared to those assessed in 1976.
Conclusions: Education influences the cognitive functioning and therefore FE needs to be assessed not only in cognitive functioning but also in
IQ for the developing nations like India. Neuropsychological tests with
updated norms should be used for clinical & research purposes so that
they do not lead to a misdiagnosis while assessing memory complaints.

R.E. RIEGER, N.C. MOSS, R.K. OHLS & J.R. LOWE. Differential
Associations Between Verbal IQ and Performance IQ and Executive
Functioning Measures in Ethnically Diverse Preschoolers.
Objective: Preschoolers born very low birth weight (VLBW, ≤1500
grams) are at risk for deficits in verbal (VIQ) and performance IQ (PIQ)
and executive functioning (EF). EF skills play a critical role in overall
cognitive, behavioral, and social-emotional development. Children from
different racial and ethnic backgrounds may display EF dysfunction

Forty Fourth Annual INS Meeting Abstracts
differently. We examined relationships between VIQ, PIQ and EF measures in VLBW preschoolers of diverse ethnic backgrounds.
Participants and Methods: Preschoolers 3 to 4.5 years born VLBW
(14 Native American, 30 Hispanic, and 31 Caucasian) were evaluated
using the WPPSI-III (PIQ and VIQ). EF was measured using Gift Delay,
Spatial Memory (SM), Beery VMI Copy and Visual Perception (VP)
WJ-III Word Memory (WM), NEPSY Comprehension of Instructions,
(CI) and Word Generation (WG).
Results: After controlling for income and test age, in the Native American group, VIQ was associated with SM (p = .001), Copy (p < .001)
and VP (p = .016), CI (p = .003), WG (p < .001), and WM (p = .003).
PIQ was associated with SM (p = .006), Copy (p < .001) and VP (p
= .013), CI (p = .003), WG (p = .001), and WM (p = .020). In the
Hispanic group, VIQ was associated with WG (p = .002) and CI (p <
.001). PIQ was associated with WG (p = .004). The Caucasian group
had associations between VIQ and CI (p = .003) and WM (p = .029).
There was no association for PIQ.
Conclusions: There were differential associations among VIQ, PIQ
and EF measures across Native American, Hispanic, and Caucasian
preschoolers. For Hispanics and Caucasians, VIQ was associated with
verbally laden tasks such as CI, WG, and WM. For Native Americans,
VIQ was associated with verbally and nonverbally laden tasks. For
Hispanics, PIQ was associated with one verbally laden task. Native
Americans PIQ was associated with the same verbally and nonverbally
laden tasks as was the VIQ. These findings highlight the need to use
multiple EF measures to assess for deficits in young children from different racial and ethnic backgrounds.

M.A. SEDO, L. MALLOY-DINIZ & A. MOREIRA. Advanced Prealphabetic Stroop Describes Processing Speed and Executive
Control in Foreign-language-speaking Children and Adults.
Objective: FIVE DIGIT STROOP (FDS) offers four basic characteristics: a) the simplicity of its decoding content (appropriate for pre-reading and dyslexic children and for illiterate or demented adults); b) its
lower left-brain requirements, not involving any kind of alphabetic
analysis; c) the special sensitivity of its switching situation, created by
Bohnen in 1992; d) its highly kurtosic and dissymmetrical response
curvers, which separate to a maximum the times and error scores of
“clinical” and “control” groups; and very specially e) its multilingual
oral administration, which is totally appropriate for linguistic minorities
and for non-English speakers
Participants and Methods: FDS introduces four timed reading exercises of identical content and increasing cognitive difficulty: reading,
counting, choosing, and switching. Items used are groups of 1 to 5
pre-alphabetical signs (digits or stars), which are recognized or read well
before the acquisition of phonological reading. DS yields objective measures of “automatic” readiness and “executive” oral-mental production.
FDS was administered (in Brazil) to groups of senescent subjects (80
MCIs and controls); and groups of 93 children aged 4 to 7, in public and
private schools, presorted as “analyzers” and “non-analyzers” with the
Ferreiro dictation method, which is valid for all languages with transparent phonetics. DS yields objective measures of “automatic” readiness
and “persistent executive” oral production.
Results: FDS shows high differences (p=.01) in the speed and errors
between “automatic” and “controlled” oral naming and decision-making of clinical and healthy groups of adults and children.
Conclusions: This allows diagnostic work with foreign populations
and language minorities, based on biological processing, naming and
decision-making speed.

Neuropsychological Assessment: Operationalizing “Quality of
Education” as High School Rankings Instead of Reading Level.
Objective: Prior research has used reading level to operationalize the
construct of quality of education (QOE) in neuropsychological research
examining performance difference between groups (e.g., Byrd et al.,
2005); however, it can be argued that reading level does not directly
measure QOE (Manly et al., 2002). The purpose of this study is to
use high school rankings (i.e., college readiness index [CRI], academic
performance index [API], and student to teacher ratio [STR]) to operationalize QOE in an attempt to improve measurement. Consistent
with prior research (Boone et al., 2007), it was hypothesized that QOE
would account for a significant portion of the variance associated with
ethnic group performance differences. It was further predicted that high
school rankings (though correlated with reading scores) would serve as
a stronger predictor.
Participants and Methods: The sample consisted of 45 neurologically
and psychologically healthy college undergraduates divided into two
groups: Hispanics (n=35) and Caucasians (n=10). Only individuals who
reported English as their first language were included. All participants
were administered a comprehensive neuropsychological test battery.
Results: Groups were equivalent with respect to age, education and
gender. Results showed that Caucasians outperformed Hispanics on
WAIS-III Vocabulary and the Boston Naming Test (BNT). Surprisingly, reading scores were not significantly correlated with high school
rankings. Further, linear regression analysis revealed that WAIS-III Vocabulary scores were predicted by both reading scores and high school
rankings, whereas for the BNT, scores were predicted by high school
rankings only (i.e. API).
Conclusions: This study questions the use of reading level as a proxy
for QOE in past research, and discusses this in light of methodological
limitations and directions for future research.

Cross-cultural Literacy Screening in Low-educated Immigrants:
A Pilot Study.
Objective: The need to assess foundational literacy skills is of paramount importance to neuropsychological assessment when evaluating
immigrants educated abroad. While education level has implications for
literacy, years of education alone is not a sufficient proxy particularly
cross-culturally. A cross-cultural literacy screen can be used as a guiding tool in neuropsychological assessment, from the conceptualization
of baseline cognitive abilities to test selection and interpretation. The
objective of this pilot study was to identify the basic elements of literacy
for a sample of immigrant, low-educated adults.
Participants and Methods: Participants included 47 low-educated (≤
9 years of education; M=3.45) immigrant patients educated abroad,
who were referred for outpatient neuropsychological. A basic literacy
screen assessing knowledge of the alphabet, numbers, high frequency
word reading and writing abilities in patients’ native language among
other skills was administered prior to comprehensive neuropsychological
evaluation.
Results: The age of patients ranged from 20 to 92 (M=65.0,SD = 15.4)
and most were female (62%). Approximately half were from Brazil,
Portugal, or Haiti. The majority of patients could sign their names and
read/write numbers and approximately half could read/write high frequency words. Analyses revealed that ability to write/recite the alphabet
was unrelated to ability to read/write high frequency words. There were
no significant differences between lower (0-4) or higher (5-9) educated
groups on reading and writing high frequency words. Number recitation
appears to be a more sensitive variable to years of education.
Conclusions: Years of education was not related to basic literacy skills
of reading/writing high frequency words, or writing/reciting the alphabet. Future directions include developing functionally-based literacy
screens with ecological validity (i.e., reading a prescription).

C.P. PECK, E. MITCHELL, A.J. MASSE, C.M. VARGA,
R.J. HEINRICHS & R.W. SCHROEDER. Utility of FBS-r scores in
Differentiating Conversion Disorders from Probable Malingering.
Objective: Peck et al. (2013) examined the utility of the MMPI-2 Symptom Validity Scale (FBS) in distinguishing conversion disorders from
probable malingering– two groups with excessive symptoms. FBS raw
score of >30 accurately classified 50% of probable malingerers and
misclassified 6% of the conversion disorder group. This study’s aim was
to evaluate the utility of FBS-r in differentiating these groups.
Participants and Methods: This quasi-experimental study reviewed
82 archival charts that met criterion designed to update the Peck et al.
study. Individuals in the conversion disorder group were video-electroencephalogram confirmed cases of psychogenic non-epileptic seizures
(PNES) who scored >40 on Test of Memory Malingering Trial 1 (n=38).
The probable malingering group consisted of mixed outpatients who
scored <40 on this measure (n=44). T-tests and chi-square tests were
used to identify differences in demographic variables and mean FBS-r
scores. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) with area under the
curve (AUC) calculation was examined for test accuracy rates.
Results: A significantly higher number of females were in the PNES
group (p = .01); no other demographic differences emerged (Age: p =
.16; Education: p = .39; Handedness: p = .92). Mean FBS-r scores were
significantly different (p = .003). AUC for FBS-r (AUC = .670, CI =
.544 – .796) was adequate. The ROC indicated that an FBS-r T-score
cutoff of >89 correctly classified 21% of the probable malingering group
and misclassified only 6% of the PNES group.
Conclusions: While FBS had more robust findings, FBS-r still adequately discriminated the groups. An FBS-r cutoff score of >89 maximized the sensitivity rate, while maintaining >90% specificity. Interestingly, Schroeder et al (2012) recommended this cutoff for differentiating
probable malingering from other clinical groups. Overall, FBS-r appears
useful for helping to distinguish these clinical groups.

R. BAEK, D. HONG, J. GRAZIANO, B.W. MACONE, A. FATZINGER,
M. RADER & A. CASHER. Diagnostic group differences in
embedded performance validity testing among patients who
scored below Word Memory Test or Medical Symptom Validity
Test failure cutoff.
Objective: Stand-alone performance validity tests (PVTs) such as
Green’s Word Memory Test (WMT) or Medical Symptom Validity Test
(MSVT) are not adequate in detecting suboptimal effort on cognitive
testing. We examined whether patients with cortical dementia (AD;
n=30), Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI; n=32), psychiatric disorders
(PSY; n=37), and no cognitive impairment (NoDx; n=35) who scored
below either WMT or MSVT failure cutoff show differential performance on embedded performance validity measures [e.g., Repeatable
Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status Effort Index
(EI), Reliable Digit Span (RDS), Wisconsin Sorting Card Test Failure
to Maintain Set (FMS) and unique errors (UE), Vocabulary minus Digit
Span Scaled Score (VC-DS)].

Participants and Methods: Neuropsychological data were collected
from patients referred to the Neuropsychology Lab at a large urban
medical center in 2014 and 2015.
Results: A multivariate analysis of variance demonstrated a statically
significant difference among diagnostic groups on the EI, RDS, and
FMS (F(15, 348)=2.82, p<.001; Wilks’ Lambda=.73). Post-hoc tests
revealed that the AD group (M=3.92, SD=1.89) performed significantly worse on EI compared to the other three groups (MCI M =2.72,
SD=0.91; PSY M=2.22, SD=1.84; NoDx M=2.77, SD=1.68). The MCI,
PSY, and NoDx groups did not differ on EI and RDS. The AD group
(M=7.05, SD=1.89) performed significantly worse on RDS compared to
the MCI group (M=8.87, SD=2.22). The PSY group (M=1.60, SD=1.35)
performed significantly worse on FMS compared to the MCI group
(M=1.01, SD=.90).
Conclusions: These findings demonstrate that the pattern of performance on PVTs can be diagnostically helpful. Results also suggest that
performance on the embedded PVTs can vary across diagnostic groups
as some of the PVTs can be relatively more indicative of genuine impairment. The optimal approach to performance validity testing in the
future may involve use of individually tailored PVTs for different diagnostic groups.

R. BRANSON, J.C. YOUNG, Z. RITTER & A. CLARK. Detecting
Suboptimal Effort in Undergraduate Students Who Simulate Brain
Injury.
Objective: Effort put forth during neuropsychological assessment can
affect tests scores dramatically. Moreover, research conducted with
college students should incorporate measures of response bias given
psychological research’s reliance on this population. The purpose of this
pilot study was to examine the effectiveness of the Word Choice Test
(WCT), and several commonly used embedded performance validity
measures, in classifying participants putting forth best effort or feigning
a brain injury for the purposes of secondary gain.
Participants and Methods: Undergraduate participants from the
University of Tennessee at Chattanooga were randomly assigned to a
Simulating Brain Injury group (n = 21) or a Do Your Best group (n =
20). After reading instructions to simulate a brain injury or an allegory
on doing one’s best, participants completed the WCT, WAIS-IV Digit
Span, DKEFS Verbal Fluency, Wisconsin Card Sorting Task (WCST),
and Slip Induction Task (SIT; Clark, Parakh, Smilek and Roy, 2012).
Results: Analyses revealed that the Simulating Brain Injury group performed significantly worse on WCT (p = .007). Additionally, the simulation group made significantly more WCST errors overall (p =.004),
more perseverative errors (p = .041) and failed to maintain set more
often (p = .016). Regardless of group differences, the mean scores of
the Simulating Brain Injury group on the WCT and failure to maintain
set of the WCST did not exceed established cutoffs. Furthermore, no
significant group differences were found on Digit Span, DKEFS Verbal
Fluency or SIT performance.
Conclusions: Despite being instructed to feign, participants in the Simulating Brain Injury group did not suppress effort adequately enough
be classified as probable malingerers. Therefore, the findings of this
pilot study indicate that the examined performance validity indicators
may be able to detect significant group differences yet lack the ability
to correctly classify suboptimal effort when applied in undergraduate
research settings.

T.W. BREARLY, R.D. SHURA, H.M. MISKEY, S.L. MARTINDALE
& J.A. ROWLAND. Understanding the Word Memory Test:
Performance Validity Beyond Learning and Memory.
Objective: The Word Memory Test (WMT) is a performance validity
test sensitive to invalid performance on tests of learning and memory;
however, its relationship to other cognitive domains is not well established. The following hypotheses were evaluated: 1) participants failing
the WMT would perform worse on tests across all cognitive domains,
and 2) when comparing performance across cognitive domains, WMT
performance would be most sensitive to learning and memory outcomes.
Participants and Methods: Participants included 204 post-9/11 Veterans. Participants completed: tests assessing all major neurocognitive
domains except language, self-report psychiatric measures, and a diagnostic clinical interview. A priori power analysis was utilized to ensure
sufficient sample size for analyses.
Results: Bonferonni corrected mean comparisons contrasted participants passing and failing the WMT. Differences across all cognitive
domains except sensation were noted. Variables demonstrated to be
significantly different between groups were entered into separate regression analyses predicting each of the continuous WMT validity outcome variables (IR, DR, CNS). Learning and memory variables alone
explained over 40% of the variance in each WMT validity outcome
(IR=43%, DR=49%, CNS=41%); however, the inclusion of other cognitive domains significantly increased the variance explained (IR=52%,
DR=61%, CNS=52%). Self-reported symptoms did not improve the
models. Significant predictors from the final model included tests of
learning, memory, attention, and executive function.
Conclusions: Results demonstrated that WMT performance shared
unique variance with performance across cognitive domains, including
learning, memory, attention, and executive function. This suggests that
invalid performance on the WMT may indicate invalid performance
across a variety of cognitive domains with the possible exception of
sensation.

M. BROWER & J. CHAMBERLAIN. Utility of the WAIS-IV Digit
Span for Detecting Poor Effort.
Objective: Research emphasizes the utility of performance validity tests
(PVTs) as a method of evaluating adequate effort during neuropsychological evaluations. There is a special importance of PVTs that are
embedded and those that do not rely on forced-choice options. The
Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale Fourth Edition (WAIS-IV; Wechsler,
2008) Digit Span (DS) subtest can be utilized as a viable PVT that is
not only embedded, but also does not rely on forced-choice options. The
purpose of this study was to compare different ways of using the DS – the
reliable digit span (RDS) and the enhanced reliable digit span (ERDS)
– in detecting poor effort. It was hypothesized that the ERDS will have
greater specificity/sensitivity than the RDS for detecting poor effort.
Participants and Methods: This study was a quasi-experimental, using
archival data. The sample of this study (n=113) was collected from
an outpatient neuropsychology clinic. Individuals who failed either the
Test of Memory Malingering (TOMM; Tombaugh, 1997) or the Word
memory Test (WMT; Green, 2003) were considered to have poor effort
versus those who did not fail a PVT. Sensitivity and specificity was
calculated for both the RDS and ERDS for detecting poor effort.
Results: Sensitivity and specificity was calculated for both RDS and
ERDS for detecting poor effort (i.e., those who failed the TOMM or
WMT). Results indicate that the ERDS had slightly better specificity/
sensitivity for detecting poor effort than the RDS.
Conclusions: While both the RDS and ERDS performed well in detecting poor effort, there was not much of a difference. Still, results
suggest further investigation of the ERDS measure to further establish
its validity for use in clinical practices. For clinical implications, it is recommended that several PVTs, not just the ERDS/RDS, be administered
within a neuropsychological battery to increase specificity.

J.A. CALLOWAY & R.L. DENNEY. Initial Validation of a New and
Quick Performance Validity Test: Green’s License Plate Test.
Objective: Green’s License Plate Test (LPT) is a new computer administered cognitive task, designed to identify poor task engagement,
and only takes approximately seven minutes to administer. This project
sought to obtain initial validation data for the LPT as a performance
validity test (PVT), and to establish preliminary normative scores for a
nonclinical group applying appropriate effort and a group simulating
traumatic brain injury (TBI).
Participants and Methods: Participants (n = 100) were acquired
through a convenience sample drawn from communities in southwestern Missouri and northeastern Tennessee. Participants were randomly
assigned to either a simulator group instructed to feign impairment
secondary to TBI according to a script, or a normal group instructed
to provide optimal effort. Exclusion criteria included history of TBI
diagnosed by a medical professional and individuals under the age of
18-years. Participants’ ages ranged from 18- to 57-years (M = 28.59,
SD = 7.67). Seventy percent of the sample was female. Education ranged
from high school diploma to doctorate degree; median education was
college degree.
Results: Since experimental data for each scale were not normally distributed, Mann-Whitney U tests were performed for comparison of mean
scores between groups. There were statistically significant differences
on each of the eight scales of the LPT, with simulators scoring lower on
each (all p < 0.001). There was no demonstrated statistically significant
difference between groups for gender (p = .275), age (p = .479), or
education (p = .142). Receiver operating characteristics (ROC) revealed
the highest area under the curve (AUC) value for the Words Recognition
scale (AUC = .922) followed by Free Recall Images (AUC = .891).
Conclusions: These data support construct validity of the LPT as a
measure to detect simulated cognitive dysfunction. Further validation
of the LPT is warranted in both nonclinical and clinical populations.

E. ALMEIDA, I. MOREIRA & S. CAVACO. Predictors of adequate
performance on the Coin in the Hand Test: findings from a clinical
sample.
Objective: To investigate the impact of cognitive functioning and psychopathological symptoms on a memory test designed to detect malingering or suboptimal effort.
Participants and Methods: The Dementia Rating Scale - 2 (DRS-2),
the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), and the Coin in the
Hand Test (CITHT) were applied to 147 patients with diagnosis of Mild
Cognitive Impairment or Dementia and without legal or forensic issues.
DRS-2 scores below the 5th percentile of demographically adequate
norms were indicative of impairment. The cut-off score used for anxiety
and depression on HADS subscales was ≥ 11. The explored cut-off score
for adequate effort was CITHT<2 errors. A multiple logistic regression
was used for data analyses.
Results: Sixty-four (44%) subjects had impaired DRS-2 scores, 46
(31%) had anxiety, and 37 (25%) had depression. Adequate performance on CITHT (i.e., <2 errors) was found: in 114 (78%) of the total
sample, in 41 (64%) subjects with impaired DRS-2, in 37 (80%) subjects with anxiety, and in 28 (76%) subjects with depression. The odds
of having adequate performance on CITHT decreased with impaired
DRS-2 scores (adjusted odds=0.242; p<0.001), but not with anxiety
(adjusted odds=1.429; p=0.448) or depression (adjusted odds=0.826;
p=0.691).

142
Conclusions: The CITHT specificity levels are high in subjects with
anxiety and depression, but decrease in cases with very low cognitive
functioning. The results confirm the potential utility of this free-standing
validity test in a clinical setting and demonstrates its robustness in the
presence of psychopathology.

Evaluation of Automatized Sequences Task as an Index of
Performance Validity in Pediatric Concussion.
Objective: Examine the Automatized Sequences Task (AST) as a performance validity measure in a sample of concussed youth by exploring
relations between performance on AST, Test of Memory and Malingering
(TOMM) and Reliable Digit Span (RDS). Effect of AST performance on
Digit Span (DS) scores was further explored.
Participants and Methods: 66 youth (age 8-17, 51% female) evaluated 2-146 days post-concussion (M=22, SD=9) completed the AST
and DS subtest. An RDS cutoff of 6 or lower was used as an indicator of
noncredible effort and was compared with AST cutoffs using chi-square.
DS scores were examined in both groups to demonstrate ecological validity. A subsample of youth (n=24) were administered the TOMM.
Results: AST cutoffs were used to categorize elevated (n=28) and
non-elevated groups (n=38). Groups did not differ in gender, time since
injury, injury characteristics (LOC, amnesias, mechanism of injury), or
premorbid history of ADHD, learning disability, or prior concussion.
Fourteen youth in the elevated group (50%) scored below RDS cutoffs whereas one person (2%) in the non-elevated group scored below
cutoffs (χ2=15, p=.06). A significant relation was found between AST
performance and recommended TOMM cutoff scores (<45) across trials,
and 89% of youth in the elevated group (N=9) scored below TOMM
cutoffs whereas no participant in the non-elevated group scored below
cutoffs (Trial1: χ2=14, p<.001; Trial2: χ2=16, p<.001).The elevated
AST group also performed significantly worse across DS conditions
compared with the non-elevated group (p<.001).
Conclusions: In a sample of concussed youth, AST performance was
significantly associated with performance on the TOMM, but nearly
significant with RDS. AST performance was associated with worse performance on an attention/working memory test. The findings provide
evidence for convergent validity between the AST and other measures
of effort in this population as well as ecological validity of AST performance to correspond to poor test performance on an attention-based
task.

J. DOUGAN & B.J. CANNON. Effectiveness of the ImPACT,
TOMM, and an Emotional Stroop Paradigm to Detect Simulated
“Sandbagging” on Baseline Concussion Testing.
Objective: With increasing public awareness of the impact of sports-related brain injury, research into accuracy of concussion detection methods is vital. Unfortunately, some athletes intentionally perform poorly on
baseline assessments in order to more quickly return to play. The validity indicators of the Immediate Post-Concussion Assessment and Cognitive Test (ImPACT) or specific tests of effort have been used to identify
sandbagging; however, these validity tools have not been combined.
Participants and Methods: The current study included 38 student
participants who completed the ImPACT, Test of Memory Malingering (TOMM) and a malingering emotional Stroop paradigm under two
conditions: best effort and “sandbagging.” Instructions were counterbalanced and examiners were blind to experimental condition.
Results: There were no order effects. Participants who were instructed
to sandbag scored significantly worse on all trials of the TOMM, all
trials of the Stroop, and four of the five ImPACT composites (Verbal
Memory, Visual Memory, Visual Motor Speed, and Impulse Control).
The expected emotional Stroop effect to malingering words was not replicated. The TOMM demonstrated high sensitivity (81%) and specificity

(88%), while the ImPACT’s validity indicator’s sensitivity was 68%
and specificity was 85%. The ImPACT accurately identified 58% of
sandbagging participants, while the TOMM accurately identified 79%.
When these measures were combined, 84% of participants instructed
to sandbag were identified. Further analysis of ImPACT validity subscores revealed variable sandbagging detection rates. Common themes
in participant sandbagging strategies included numerical patterns (e.g.,
answering every 15th question incorrectly), intentionally choosing the
wrong answer, and not paying attention or ignoring the instructions
and/or stimuli.
Conclusions: These findings emphasize the need for baseline concussion testing to include established tests of effort, in order to detect sandbagging and reduce the potential harm to these athletes.

T.J. FARRER, E.D. BIGLER & M. BROOKS. Clinical Utility of
TOMM Trial 1 in Academic Accessibility Populations.
Objective: Performance validity tests (PVT) are considered a critical
component of a neuropsychological assessment. Given clinical time constraints in standard practice, it is important that clinicians can provide
concise yet thorough examinations. As such, having a flexible approach
to performance validity assessment may be beneficial in clinical practice.
The Test of Memory Malingering (TOMM), a frequently administered
PVT, has two trials and a delay trial, making administration time upwards of twenty minutes. However, prior research suggests that using
trial 1 of the TOMM can have robust clinical utility negating the need of
trial 2, although this has not been examined in academic accommodation seeking college students. The present study sought to extend prior
research by examining the utility of TOMM trial 1 in this unique sample.
Participants and Methods: Participants were 539 male (62%) and
female college students (mean age 24.8; SD= 6.9) who were referred to
a university’s student accessibility center to determine their need for academic accommodations. Evaluations included academic and cognitive
testing. Trials 1 and 2 (T1 & T2) of the TOMM were part of evaluation
procedures in 228 cases. Comparisons were made between T1 and T2
to determine overall fail rate of each and the chance of failing T2 when
T1 is above the standard cut-score of 45.
Results: 200/228 examinees passed T1 (range 26-50; M= 48.0; SD=
3.5) and 224/228 passed T2 (range 29-50; M= 49.67; SD= 1.77). Fail
rate of TOMM T1 was 12% (n= 28). However, fail rate of TOMM T2
was 2% (n= 4). Of the 200 people who passed TOMM T1 (<45), all
passed T2 (Hit Rate= 100%).
Conclusions: If patients pass T1it is uncommon for a failing score on
T2. Findings support prior research of a possible discontinuation rule
given minimal incremental validity to T2 when T1 scores are above 45.
A flexible approach to using T1 of TOMM as a PVT could save clinicians
administration and scoring time in an otherwise busy clinical setting.

J.M. GRABYAN, R. COLLINS, W.A. ALVERSON & D. CHEN. Errors
on the First 10 Items of the Test of Memory Malingering Predicts
Failure on Later Trials of the Test of Memory Malingering.
Objective: Effort testing is becoming an increasingly vital component of
neuropsychological evaluation. However, standalone measures of effort
can be time consuming to administer. This barrier is made more salient
in the context of busy inpatient evaluations, where time with the patient
is at a premium. As the Test of Memory Malingering (TOMM) is the most
commonly used and widely researched effort measure, much work has
been focused toward developing abbreviated versions of it, including cut
scores for Trial 1, that still preserve its diagnostic accuracy for predicting
insufficient effort. It was hypothesized that a recent addition to these
efforts, number of errors on the first 10 items of Trial 1 (TOMMe10),

Forty Fourth Annual INS Meeting Abstracts
would predict future failure on Trial 1 and/or Trial 2 of the TOMMe10
with high sensitivity and specificity.
Participants and Methods: Subjects were 179 inpatient veterans referred for neuropsychological screening as part of a week-long inpatient
observation on an epilepsy monitoring unit to establish the presence of
epileptic seizures or psychogenic non-epileptic events. Patients were
administered both learning trials of the Test of Memory Malingering as
part of a larger battery.
Results: Using a previously established score cut-score of ≥2 errors
as indicative of failing TOMMe10 yielded a sensitivity rate of .92 and
specificity of .93. Youden’s Index of receiver operator characteristic
(ROC) analysis also revealed the ≥2 errors cut-off as the optimal choice.
Conclusions: The TOMMe10 shows great promise in its ability to predict future TOMM failure rates. In populations where time with the
patient is at a premium, such as brief inpatient stays, a clear failure of
the TOMMe10 can potentially be used as a stand in for TOMM failure.
This early discontinue criteria could allow the examiner to potentially
use their time more effectively. At the least, adding TOMMe10 to examinations of Trials 1 and 2 could assist in cementing an examiners
diagnostic certainty on effort failure.

Unique to the test, during the retention trial there are four correct answers and one foil. A score of 24 or 25 per trial is statistically better
than chance; a score of 16 or below is statistically worse than chance.
Participants and Methods: A simulation study was conducted using
51 young adults who were assigned to a feigning (n = 26) or control
condition (n = 25). Individuals in the feigning condition were asked to
perform as if they had attention, memory, and processing speed deficits.
Diagnostic classification statistics were derived to evaluate the Vegas
Odds Test ability to differentiate the two groups.
Results: Individuals in the feigning group achieved statistically lower
Vegas Odds Test scores than the control group [t (26.16) = 3.52, p < .01,
Cohen’s d = .98, ROC A.U.C. = .78, p < .01]. Sensitivity was maximized
with a cut score of 48 (Sn = 1.00), whereas, specificity was maximized
with a cut-score of 50 (Sp = .69). Further analyses will be conducted to
analyze specific trials and various combinations of cut scores.
Conclusions: The Vegas Odds Test is a novel performance validity test.
It effectively differentiates between groups of individuals putting forth
valid performance and those exaggerating cognitive symptoms. Further
validation is needed in clinical and forensic samples.

Indicators of suboptimal effort embedded in the Wechsler Memory
Scale – Fourth Edition (WMS-IV).
Objective: The Wechsler Memory Scale (WMS) is one of the most widely
used test batteries to assess different memory functions in impaired
patients with brain dysfunctions of different etiologies. Recognition and
visual working memory tasks from the Wechsler Memory Scale – Fourth
Edition (WMS-IV) have previously been documented as useful indicators for suboptimal effort. The present study examined the clinical utility
of the Dutch version of the WMS-IV (WMS-IV-NL) for the identification
of suboptimal effort using an analogue study design.
Participants and Methods: The patient group consisted of 59 patients
with moderate to severe acquired brain injury (ABI); the simulating
malingerers were 50 healthy individuals who were asked to simulate
cognitive impairment as a result of a TBI; the last group consisted of 50
healthy controls who were instructed to put forth full effort.
Results: Simulating malingerers performed significantly lower on all
WMS-IV-NL tasks compared to ABI patients and healthy controls. A
binary logistic regression analysis was performed on the simulating malingerers and ABI patients. The first model contained the visual working
memory subtests (Spatial Addition and Symbol Span) and the recognition tasks of the following subtests: Logical Memory, Verbal Paired
Associates, Designs, Visual Reproduction. The results showed an overall
classification rate of 78.4 %, and only Spatial Addition explained a
significant amount of variation (p < .001). Subsequent logistic regression analysis and Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analysis
supported the discriminatory power of the subtest Spatial Addition. A
scaled score cut-off of <4 produced 93% specificity and 52% sensitivity
for detection of suboptimal effort.
Conclusions: The WMS-IV-NL visual working memory subtest Spatial
Addition may provide clinically useful information for the detection of
suboptimal effort.

test based on binomial probability. In the first 25 item trial, four target
stimuli (playing cards) are presented for 2 seconds and then after a 3
second delay the participant is asked to identify one target stimuli out of
five choices. The perceived difficulty increases in the second 25 item trial
due to a target stimuli display of 1 second and a 6 second delay interval.

Dementia Profile of Word Memory Test and Medical Symptom
Validity Test among Patients Who Failed the Easy Subtests.
Objective: Dementia Profile (DP) was developed to address the false
positives for poor effort on the Word Memory Test (WMT) and Medical
Symptom Validity Test (MSVT). Although it was found useful in distinguishing severe cognitive impairment from stimulated malingering,
its utility in a clinical setting has not been thoroughly examined. This
study assessed the sensitivity and specificity of the DP in a clinical
sample of adults who scored below the suggested cutoff scores for the
WMT or MSVT.
Participants and Methods: Neuropsychological data of 154 participants was extracted from a larger data set of patients referred to the
Neuropsychology Lab at a large urban medical center in 2014 and
2015. The patients were divided into two groups: 1) genuine cognitive
impairment (GCI) group, including patients with dementia or Mild Cognitive Impairment diagnoses (N=82; 50% female; 89% Caucasian; M
age=72.3, SD=9.2), and 2) no neurological symptoms (NoDx) group,
including patients with psychiatric illness or other non-neurological factors (N=72; 57% female; 75% Caucasian; M age=47.0, SD=15.9). Sensitivity and specificity of the DP were computed using these two groups.
Results: 76 out of 82 patients in the GCI group exhibited a DP and 38
out of 72 patients in the NoDx group showed a DP. The sensitivity of the
DP for the detection of genuine cognitive impairment was 92.7% while
the specificity of the DP (or the probability that a DP will not be produced when genuine cognitive impairment is not present) was 47.2%.
Conclusions: The DP is a sensitive instrument in identifying genuine
cognitive impairment among patients who scored below WMT or MSVT
failure cutoff. However, results indicated that the DP had a relatively
low specificity in our sample. Further studies are necessary to consider
new approaches to address the low specificity of DP (e.g., increasing
cut-off scores) among clinical patients with WMT or MSVT failure.

validity. Response time (RT) is a promising covert measure to distinguish between honest and feigned performance; however, research
investigating RT patterns on PVTs is sparse and troubled by methodological problems. This study examined the incremental utility of RT
variables on a traditional PVT in distinguishing adults with verified TBI
from adults coached to feign neurocognitive impairment.
Participants and Methods: Participants included 25 adults with
moderate to severe TBI (TBI), 43 healthy adult controls (HC), and 31
healthy adults coached to simulate TBI (SIM). Participants completed
the Test of Memory Malingering adapted for computer administration.
A number of RT variables were examined along with the standard accuracy score. Groups were equivalent in age and education.
Results: ANOVA and Kruskal-Wallis tests indicated that RT variables
differing among the three groups included average RT for correct and
total responses, coefficient of variation for Trial 2 responses, ratio of RT
for correct to incorrect responses, and frequency of lengthy (> 2000ms)
responses. Follow-up analyses revealed that only average RT for correct
and total responses and the frequency of lengthy responses differed significantly between SIM and TBI. Binary logistic regression revealed that
average RT for Trial 2 responses added incremental value to standard
Trial 2 accuracy in discriminating HC from SIM; however, it did not
add predictive value to Trial 2 accuracy in discriminating SIM from TBI.
Conclusions: Several RT variables differed between HC and SIM on
the TOMM, but only one improved discrimination of HC and SIM.
Fewer RT variables differed between SIM and TBI, and none improved
discrimination between these groups. These findings highlight the importance of including individuals with bona fide TBI when evaluating
and developing performance validity measures.

J.M. KLAVER, A.N. RABKIN, E. KRAPF, D.T. PULSIPHER &
L.D. STANFORD. The Relationship between Self-Reported
Symptom Validity and Performance Validity in Children with
Neurologic Disorders.
Objective: There is a growing interest in the investigation of performance validity (PV) in neuropsychological test performance of children,
but there are relatively few studies evaluating childhood symptom validity (SV) reporting. Studies with adults suggest that PV and SV are
strongly associated, but Kirk et al. (2014) reported no significant relationship between SV (self-report BASC-2) and PV (Medical Symptom
Validity Test [MSVT]) scores in a mild TBI (mTBI) sample of children.
However, no study has investigated this relationship in a general clinical
population (e.g., mTBI, epilepsy, brain tumor, prematurity, etc.).
Participants and Methods: 113 consecutive, age-eligible clinically-referred patients ages 7-17 years (M=10.47 years, SD=1.72) were
administered the MSVT and the Revised Children’s Manifest Anxiety
Scale, 2nd Edition (RCMAS-2), a self-report anxiety measure including
a validity index (Defensiveness subscale), as part of a larger neuropsychological battery. The MSVT was scored as pass or fail (raw score<85
on any of three primary indices was considered failing). The RCMAS-2
was also scored dichotomously with a T-score of 65+ on the Defensiveness subscale considered invalid. A Fisher’s exact test and Spearman’s
rho correlations were used to determine the relationship between MSVT
and RCMAS-2 validity scores.
Results: 20 patients failed the MSVT, and the majority of these patients (90%) provided valid self-report RCMAS-2 profiles, with only 2
patients (10%) producing an invalid profile. There was not a significant
relationship between MSVT and RCMAS-2 scores (p=1.00, two-tailed
Fisher’s exact test; r’s < 0.10).
Conclusions: Although the present study only examined anxiety SV,
findings are consistent with Kirk et al. (2014) and add to the literature
that SV and PV tests are unrelated and provide differential, non-overlapping information in children with neurologic disorders.

R. LAURENT & J.D. GFELLER. Detecting Feigned ADHD
Symptoms in College Students with the Test of Variables of
Attention.
Objective: The Test of Variables of Attention (TOVA) is a recognized
continuous performance test used primarily as an auxiliary diagnostic
tool for assessment of Attention Deficit-Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD).
The latest edition of the TOVA utilizes a Symptom Exaggeration Index
(SEI) as an embedded measure of performance validity. The current
study examined how well the SEI correctly classified participants as
having provided good or poor effort on a brief battery of neuropsychological measures.
Participants and Methods: Data were collected from undergraduate research participants which included 27 individuals assigned to an
optimal effort group and 24 individuals to a simulated ADHD group.
Participants in the simulated ADHD group were coached on symptom
presentation of ADHD and asked to perform in such a way as to simulate
ADHD symptoms and deficits.
Results: Logistic regression was performed to ascertain the likelihood
that greater SEI scores could predict group membership. The model
explained 42.9% (Nagelkerke R-squared) of the variance in group
membership and correctly classified 77.6% of participants. Positive
predictive power of the TOVA was 73.9%, while negative predictive
power was 80.8%.
Conclusions: These findings provide some support for the efficacy of
the SEI as an effort indicator embedded in the TOVA. Future research
should compare the accuracy of the SEI against other embedded and
stand-alone effort indictors.

S.M. LIPPA, B.N. AXELROD & R. LANGE. Subjective Memory
Problems, Performance Validity Test Failure, and Objective
Neurocognitive Performance.
Objective: Patients’ cognitive complaints are often considered an important part of neuropsychological evaluations. The current study examines the relationship between self-reported memory problems (SMPs),
performance validity test (PVT) failure, and objective cognitive test
performance.
Participants and Methods: Participants were 321 patients with mixed
etiologies (91.0% male; Age: M=52.4, SD=17.4) from a Department of
Veterans Affairs neuropsychology clinic. Participants were divided into
two groups based on their SMPs (SMP-Present: n=257; SMP-Absent:
n=64).
Results: PVT failure rates were not significantly different between the
SMP-Present group (18%) and the SMP-Absent group (10%). Compared to participants in the SMP-Absent group, a similar proportion
of the participants in the SMP-Present group had low scores (i.e.,
>1SD below the mean of the normative sample) on Wechsler Memory
Scale-IV (WMS-IV) Logical Memory (LM) and Visual Reproduction
(VR) Immediate Recall (IR) and Delayed Recall (DR) and California
Verbal Learning Test-II (CVLT-II) Trial 1, Total Recall, and Short
and Long Delayed Free Recall. Of participants in the SMPs-Present
group, 36-38% had low scores on LM, 46% on VR IR, 60% on VR
DR, and 48-65% on each of the CVLT-II measures. Of participants
in the SMP-Absent group, 42-43% had low scores on LM, 37% on VR
IR, 56% on VR DR, and 47-69% on each of the CVLT-II measures.
Logistic regression was used to predict intact (≤1SD below the mean)
versus impaired (>1SD below the mean) cognitive test performance
using FSIQ, SMP, and PVT performance as predictors. Results revealed
that FSIQ, but not PVT performance or SMPs, was related to WMS-IV

Forty Fourth Annual INS Meeting Abstracts
Delayed Memory Index (p<.001; Exp(B)=.938) and CVLT-II Total Recall (p<.001; Exp(B)=.941).
Conclusions: SMPs do not appear to be associated with objective memory difficulties or failure on PVTs. SMPs or lack thereof are not sufficient
for making inferences about a patient’s objective memory problems.

P. MARTIN, R.W. SCHROEDER, K.A. WYMAN-CHICK, B. HUNTER
& R.J. HEINRICHS. Does Performance Invalidity Impact the
Accuracy of TOPF Word Reading Predictions of Premorbid FSIQ?
Objective: Word reading estimates of premorbid functioning are widely
used in neuropsychology as word reading abilities are thought to be
relatively resistant to neurologic injury and disease. There is limited
research indicating whether such estimates can be interpreted when
individuals fail performance validity tests (PVTs); the current study
aims to address this gap in the literature.
Participants and Methods: Participants were 259 patients referred
for neuropsychological evaluation, excluding for dementia, intellectual
disability, and left-sided cerebral vascular accident. Participants were
placed into one of three groups according to whether they passed all
PVTs (n=165), failed 1 PVT (n=51), or failed 2+ PVTs (n=43). ANCOVA’s were used to assess for group differences in TOPF word reading
predicted FSIQ while controlling for education. Additionally, discrepancies between word reading predicted FSIQ and demographic predicted
FSIQ were also compared across the three groups.
Results: PVT failure status had a significant effect on word reading
predicted FSIQ after controlling for education, F(2,255) = 12.48, p <
.001. The adjusted mean predicted FSIQ scores were 101.3, 96.7, and
93.6 for the PVT pass, 1 failure, and 2+ failure groups, respectively.
Bonferroni corrected pairwise comparisons revealed that predicted FSIQ
scores were significantly lower at p < .05 for both PVT failure groups
as compared to the PVT pass group. The discrepancy between word
reading and demographic predicted FSIQ also differed between groups
(p < .001), with the magnitude of the discrepancy being more than three
times larger in those failing 2+ PVTS (M=9.7) when compared to those
passing all PVTs (M=3.01).
Conclusions: Individuals invalidating neuropsychological testing are
likely to underperform on TOPF word reading. Thus, word reading predicted FSIQ estimates should not be interpreted in individuals suspected
of performance invalidity. In such individuals, demographically based
predictions might provide a more accurate estimate of FSIQ.

L. NORDSTROM, C.E. JACKSON, C.B. FORTIER, W.P. MILBERG
& R. MCGLINCHEY. Performance Validity Testing Among OEF/
OIF/OND Veterans in Research and Clinical Contexts.
Objective: Veterans with possible deployment-related TBI are referred
for a Comprehensive TBI Evaluation through the Veterans Health Administration (VHA). Many individuals are subsequently referred for
neuropsychological evaluations to further characterize their cognitive
functioning. The current study compared measures of cognitive performance as well as measures of performance validity for 19 veterans of
Operations Enduring Freedom (OEF), Iraqi Freedom (OIF), and New
Dawn (OND) who completed clinical neuropsychological testing and
participated in a longitudinal research study.
Participants and Methods: Participants included OEF/OIF/OND
Veterans enrolled in the Translational Research Center for TBI and
Stress Disorders (TRACTS). CVLT-II scores, including Forced Choice
(a validity measure) were extracted from veterans’ medical records
and research data; Recognition Memory Test (RMT) data and Medical Symptom Validity Test (MSVT) were obtained from clinical and
research records respectively.

145
Results: The difference in CVLT-II total scores between the clinical
and research contexts was not significant, however, mean clinical scores
on all four delayed recall measures were significantly lower (p<.05)
than scores from research. Although there was no significant difference
in CVLT-II Forced Choice scores between the research and clinical
contexts (p=.06), 28.6% of individuals performed below expectation
during clinical evaluation, compared to 5.3% during research evaluation (n=19). On the RMT, 60.0% performed below expectation based
on an empirically validated cutoff (Warrington, 2010) (n=15), while
10.5% performed below cutoff on the MSVT during participation in
TRACTS (n=19).
Conclusions: OEF/OIF/OND veterans had lower performance on the
CVLT-II within a clinical context, but also exhibited higher rates of
failure on stand-alone and embedded performance validity tests compared to a research context. These findings highlight the importance of
including performance validity tests during a clinical neuropsychological
evaluation.

& J. LINCK. Choice of Performance Validity Test Drastically Alters
the Relation between PTSD Diagnosis and Cognitive Testing.
Objective: PTSD is generally considered to have direct effects on cognitive test performance. Studies of PTSD and cognition that have incorporated performance validity tests (PVTs) have arrived at disparate
conclusions regarding the presence of these effects after performance
invalidity is taken into account. The aim of the current study is to
examine the relation between PTSD and cognitive testing before and
after excluding for performance invalidity using three different PVTs
with widely varying detection rates.
Participants and Methods: Participants were drawn from a sample
of 257 veterans referred for neuropsychological evaluation secondary
to suspected combat-related mild TBI in the Iraq or Afghanistan wars.
The final sample consisted of 150 participants (mean age = 31.5 years;
98% male). PTSD was defined as a score of 50 or higher on the PTSD
Checklist. PVTs used in the current study were Reliable Digit Span
(RDS), Test of Memory Malingering Trial 1 (TOMM1), and the Word
Memory Test. Fourteen cognitive variables were derived from 10 standardized measures of processing speed, attention, visuospatial skills,
verbal fluency, and executive functioning. PTSD group differences on
cognitive testing were analyzed using T-tests.
Results: Significant PTSD group differences (p<.05) were noted on 9
of 14 cognitive variables prior to exclusion for performance invalidity. The detection rates for the RDS, TOMM1, and WMT were 12.7%,
27.3%, and 47.3%. PTSD group differences were noted on 7, 6, and 0
of the cognitive variables following exclusion for invalidity on the RDS,
TOMM1, and WMT, respectively.
Conclusions: Notably divergent results were obtained when using different, but well validated, measures of performance validity prior to
examining the relation between PTSD and cognition. The results of the
current study strongly suggest that use of dissimilar PVTs will likely
contribute to contradictory or otherwise inconsistent findings in future
research on the relation between cognition and psychiatric disorders.

D.T. PULSIPHER. Classification Accuracy of an Embedded Forced
Choice Measure of Effort in the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test
Among Youth.
Objective: There is growing interest in the use of stand-alone and embedded performance validity measures as indicators of effort among
youth. While a forced choice recognition component in list-learning

146
tasks is sometimes used as an embedded effort measure among adults,
this has not been reported in youth to date. The purpose of this study
was to examine the classification accuracy of a newly-developed forced
choice recognition component of the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test
(RAVLT) in clinical evaluations of youth.
Participants and Methods: The sample included 320 consecutive
clinically-referred youth (M=14.1 years, ages 7-18) who received a
neuropsychological evaluation in a medical setting. All included participants completed the Medical Symptom Validity Test (MSVT) and
the RAVLT, including a 15-item forced choice recognition component
(RAVLT-FC). Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV),
and negative predictive value (NPV) were examined using various cutoffs on the RAVLT-FC. Classification functions were also examined
by creating subgroups based on referring medical diagnosis such as
concussion (n=205) and other medical conditions (e.g., epilepsy, cancer/
tumor, genetic disorders).
Results: Results indicated that a cutoff of 15 (100% correct) on the
RAVLT-FC showed adequate sensitivity (94.3%) and PPV (89.8%)
with more weak specificity (32.1%) and NPV (47.4%) among the entire
sample. A significant decline in specificity occurred using a cut-off of 14
or lower. Similar patterns of adequate sensitivity and PPV with weak
sensitivity and NPV were seen across subgroups.
Conclusions: The RAVLT-FC is a potentially useful clinical indicator of
effort among clinically-referred youth. While it may be useful in evaluating adequate effort, it shows less promise as an indicator of poor effort.
The ease of use makes it a relatively simple addition to most neuropsychological test batteries, and it can be used in conjunction with other
stand-alone and embedded measures to provide incremental validity.

Effectiveness of the Vegas Odds Test in Comparison to Traditional
and Embedded Performance Validity Tests.
Objective: The Vegas Odds Test is a recently developed, novel performance validity test based on binomial probability. While preliminary
research has documented that the measure effectively differentiates
between individuals who put forth sufficient and insufficient effort, it
is unknown whether it is as effective as traditional and embedded performance validity tests. This research will compare the Vegas Odds Test
with the Victoria Symptom Validity Test (VSVT), WAIS-IV Reliable
Digit Span (RDS), and CVLT-II Forced Choice (FC). This will facilitate
a greater understanding of the Vegas Odds Test potential clinical utility.
Participants and Methods: 51 participants completed an hour long
battery. Measures were randomly administered and participants were
asked to put forth their best effort (n = 25) or feign cognitive symptoms
(n = 26). Performance differences between groups across measures were
investigated.
Results: Diagnostic classification varied among the measures. The
VSVT displayed the best sensitivity (1.00) and specificity (.84). The
Vegas Odds Test (Sn = 1.00, Sp = .46) was more effective at differentiating groups than the embedded RDS (Sn = .96, Sp = .38) and CVLT-II
FC (Sn = 1.00, Sp = .13). The Vegas Odds Test correctly classified 73%
of the participants, which is less than the VSVT (92%), but greater than
embedded effort tasks (RDS = 67%; CVLT FC = 58%).
Conclusions: The Vegas Odds Test appears to be more effective at
accurately predicting group membership than embedded effort indicators, but is not as effective as the VSVT, a well-validated stand-alone
effort measure. While promising, additional research is needed to fully
evaluate the Vegas Odds Tests. It is quite possible revisions to the task
and directions may improve the effectiveness of the measure.

M. ROSSETTI, R. COLLINS & M.K. YORK. Performance Validity
in Deep Brain Stimulation Candidates.
Objective: Effort and motivation are important factors that influence
performance on neuropsychological tests. To date, no one has looked
at performance validity tests (PVTs) in a sample of highly motivated
individuals who are at risk for developing dementia. Neuropsychological
assessments are routinely conducted as part of comprehensive evaluations for candidacy for deep brain stimulation surgery (DBS) with good
cognitive performance further endorsing a patient’s candidacy. Thus,
we can assume that candidates for DBS are motivated to do well and
to have a low failure rate on PVTs. This study will investigate effort
in Parkinson’s disease (PD) and essential tremor (ET) in DBS surgery
candidates who are at increased risk for cognitive impairment.
Participants and Methods: Thirty DBS candidates underwent neuropsychological evaluation including completion of the Word Memory
Test (WMT). The sample consisted of 21 participants with PD and 9
with ET (Mage=66). Half of the participants did not meet criteria for a
neurocognitive disorder, while 2 subjects were diagnosed with PD-Dementia and 13 were diagnosed with MCI.
Results: Using manualized cut scores, a total of 19 DBS candidates
earned a WMT pass score, whereas 8 patients obtained scores in the
“caution” range, and 3 patients produced failing scores. Two of the three
WMT failures met the 30 point Genuine Memory Impairment Profile
(GMIP) criteria. Verbal memory performance (learning, short-term, and
delayed) was average for the “pass” and “caution” group and mildly
impaired for the “fail” group. Depression scores were highest for the
“caution” group.
Conclusions: This pilot study is the first to describe PVT performance
of DBS candidates. Of the 15 patients with cognitive impairment in
this group of highly motivated older individuals, only one patient failed
the PVT and did not reach the GMIP criteria. Future studies will include a larger sample size and will evaluate the role of mood in PVT
performance.

R.L. STEGMAN & W.R. COLE. Equal versus Separate Distributions
of Neuropsychological Data Relative to Numbers of Performance
Validity Measures.
Objective: Performance validity measures (PVMs) in neuropsychological (NP) assessments are standard of care for determining credibility
of psychometric data. Per literature, guidelines for the interpretation of
positive PVMs are: 1 is possible, 2 is probable, and 3 or more is definite
noncredible data. Dissent, reflected in the literature as well, is a concern
of a Monte Carlo effect: the more PVMs administered, the greater the
probability of chance positive results. Using a combination of statistical
significance and Cohen’s d, examiners tested two hypotheses:
1. There are separate NP score distributions relative to the number of
positive PVMs.
2. There is a Monte Carlo effect.
Participants and Methods: The data from 154 consecutive comprehensive NP assessments administered in a military clinical setting were
analyzed. They were heterogeneous with regard to severity of injuries
and purposes for a comprehensive assessment. Each had been administered 8 to 10 established PVMs as part of a comprehensive assessment.
Results: Number of positive PVMs ranged from 0 to 9 with 1 positive
PVM as the mode. Those with 5 or more positive PVMs did not differ
significantly and were grouped as 5+. Distribution: 0 = 16%, 1 = 23%, 2
= 17%, 3 = 12%, 4 = 8% and 5+ = 24%. The average Cohen’s d: 0 v 1 =
0.187, 0 v 2 = 0.361, 0 v 3 = 0.518, 0 v 4 = 0.872, and 0 v 5+ = 1.252.
Conclusions: Hypotheses 1: There is a clear pattern of emerging separate distributions of data related to the number of positive PVMs. Hypothesis 2: There is a limited Monte Carlo effect. Distributions of 0 and 1
PVM groups are almost identical. 2 and 3 positive PVMs groups are heterogeneous. Separate distributions are not apparent until 4 or 5 positive
PVMs. Results indicate 4+ positive PVMs is definite noncredible, reveal

Forty Fourth Annual INS Meeting Abstracts
a need for critical thinking with 2 or 3 positive PVMs, and emphasize
the need for multiple and varied PVMs throughout a NP assessment.

Learning Test in Samples of Patients Suspected of Dementia,
Forensic Patients, Simulators, and Normal Control.
Objective: The present study examined the base-rate and norms of
the Rey Auditory Learning Test Performance Rey Validity Indicator
(RAVLT-VI) in several samples.
Participants and Methods: Participants were patients referred for
screening of dementia subdivided into mild, moderate, and severe impairment based on the St. Louis Mental Status Exam. Four categories
of participants consisted of a sample of forensic patients identified as
not exhibiting adequate effort (N=28), a sample of college students
who were instructed to simulate PTSD (N=34), and a sample of normal
control in a random sample (N=198).
Results: Using specificity and sensitivity analysis, the data shows
that unlike the RAVLT-FCR (Forced Choice Recognition Index), the
RAVLT-VI is more likely to identify individuals with poor effort, high
sensitivity, but is also likely to misidentify some individuals who are
not exhibiting poor effort, particularly among older adult patients (low
specificity).
Conclusions: The limitations and benefits of utilizing the RAVLT-FCR
and RAVLT-VI are discussed.

K. WHEARTY, E. DICKINSON, A. MARTINI, K.H. FROST &
G.P. STRAUSS. Evaluation of the Validity of the Reliable Spatial
Span as an Effort Index on the MATRICS Consensus Cognitive
Battery in Schizophrenia.
Objective: Past studies have indicated a wide range of neuropsychological effort test failure rates in patients with psychotic disorders on
free-standing and embedded effort tests. Increased failure rate has been
associated with greater severity of negative symptoms and lower IQ. It
has yet to be determined whether an effort index can be derived from the
gold standard neuropsychological test battery, the MATRICS Consensus
Cognitive Battery (MCCB). This study aimed to test validity of such an
index – the Reliable Spatial Span (RSS), calculated from the spatial
span subtest of the MCCB.
Participants and Methods: Participants included 30 outpatients with
schizophrenia (SZ) and 33 demographically-matched healthy controls
(CN) who received the MCCB. A measure of insufficient effort was
derived from the MCCB Spatial Span subtest by calculating the RSS.
Results: A total of 30% SZ and 3% CN fell below the RSS effort index
cut-off. SZ who failed differed from SZ who passed only on a visual
memory subtest and the spatial span subtest. However, there were no
differences between patients who passed and failed the effort index on
measures of processing speed, executive functioning, attention, social
cognition, or verbal memory. There was also no association with clinically rated negative symptoms, including avolition.
Conclusions: These findings question the validity of the RSS as an
effort index on the MCCB. Results suggest that the RSS may be tapping
into true cognitive deficits rather than effort in SZ.

D. WHITESIDE, H. LUU, M. MILLER, O. GAASEDELEN, L. RICE
& M.R. BASSO. Cross Validation of a Cross-Domain Logistically
Derived Performance Validity Test in a Psychiatric Sample.
Objective: Combining individual performance validity tests (PVT) using
logistic regression has received increasing empirical attention recently as
methodology for developing difficult to coach embedded PVTs (Miller
et al., 2011; Wolfe, et al., 2010). Whiteside et al., (2015) extended this
methodology by using cross-domain measures to create a logistically
derived PVT (CLEP). The current study evaluated the replicability
of this PVT in a sample of non-neurological psychiatric patients. The
Whiteside et al., (2015) CLEP used measures from multiple domains,
including verbal memory (the California Verbal Learning Test-II Trial
5[CVLT-T5], Total Hits[CVLT-TH], and False Positives[CVLT-FP]),
attention (Brief Test of Attention [BTA]), and language (Boston Naming
Test [BNT], and Animal Fluency [AF]), and had excellent classification
accuracy.
Participants and Methods: Participants included 146 consecutive
referrals who completed all measures and were diagnosed with a depressive or anxiety disorder and no history of neurocognitive, neurodevelopmental, or substance use disorders. The FAILPVT group included patients who failed >2 free-standing or embedded PVTs (N=14)
while the PASSPVT group included participants who passed all PVTs
(N=121). MANOVA and ROC analyses were conducted to determine
group differences and classification accuracy.
Results: MANOVA and post-hoc analyses indicated that the FAILPVT
group performed significantly lower on CVLT-TH, CVLT_FP, and the
CLEP compared to the PASSPVT group. On ROC analysis, CVLT-TH
(AUC=.73) and BNT (AUC=.73) had adequate classification accuracy,
while CLEP had slightly higher classification accuracy (AUC=.79).
Conclusions: The CLEP AUC was slightly lower than in the original
sample but continued to demonstrate improved classification accuracy
over individual embedded PVTs.
The results indicated that the CLEP variable could be replicated in a
different, non-neurologically impaired, sample and support the use of
this logistical-derived PVT.

V. CHAVARRO, A. LACHETA, F. PACHE, J. BELLMANN-STROBL,
F. PAUL & A. BRANDT. Cognition, Fatigue And Depression in
Neuromyelitis Optica Patients.
Objective: Neuromyelitis Optica (NMO) is a neuro-inflammatory disease affecting the optic nerve and spinal cord, which was recently described to have a distinct etiology from Multiple Sclerosis. Cognition,
fatigue and depression within Caucasian populations with NMO are not
yet well understood. Our objective was to investigate cognitive performance and its relation to fatigue and depression in patients diagnosed
with NMO.
Participants and Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional observational study including 26 patients with NMO and 25 age and sex
matched healthy controls. Cognitive performance was evaluated with
the Brief Repeatable Battery of Neuropsychological Tests (BRB-N). Participants also completed the Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS) and the Beck
Depression Inventory (BDI). We compared performance of patients and
healthy controls on individual cognitive domains of the BRB-N and
tested its association with FSS and BDI scores.
Results: Our data show that depression and fatigue are more prevalent in NMO patients compared to controls (BDI>19: 46% versus 4%,
p=.001; FSS>4: 54% versus 12%, p=.002, respectively). NMO patients
had significantly lower performance on Attention and Concentration
(z-score diff.=.594, p=.04), which remained marginally significant for
Executive Function (z-score diff.=.607, p=.09) and the total BRB-N

148
scores (z-score diff.=.569, p=.06). When sub-scores of BRB-N were
adjusted for fatigue and depression, we did not observe a significant
effect of group on adjusted BRB-N scores.
Conclusions: NMO patients suffer from comorbid depression and
fatigue. In addition, they exhibit lower cognitive performance within
the domain of attention and concentration. However, our subsequent
analyses imply that these differences may be at least partially accounted
for by levels of fatigue and depression, suggesting that treating fatigue
or depression may improve cognitive performance in NMO patients.

L. HARDER. Premorbid Cognitive Problems in Pediatric Multiple
Sclerosis: Could grade retention be an early sign?
Objective: The present study compared historical data of educational
problems in pediatric patients diagnosed with multiple sclerosis (MS).
Since MS is a demyelinating disease that affects the brain and spinal
cord pediatric transverse myelitis (TM) patients, with pathology in the
spinal cord only, were included as a comparison group. Given brainbased pathology, it was hypothesized that MS patients would have more
early educational problems compared to TM.
Participants and Methods: Parents of 46 pediatric MS and 41 pediatric TM patients reported Early Educational Services (EES; i.e., Early
Childhood Intervention/Preschool Program for Children with Disabilities), grade retention, suspension and utilization of special education
services.
Results: Chi-squared and independent t-tests indicated no significant
group differences for gender, ethnicity or race. However, TM patients
were younger at initial visit (p < .01) and reported to have utilized
significantly more EES (p < .05), while the MS group was reported to
have significantly more grade retention (p < .05). Chart review revealed
that within the TM group, EES did not predate diagnosis; however 89%
of grade retentions predated diagnosis in MS patients.
Conclusions: The hypothesis was partially supported, as TM patients
utilized more EES; however, the MS group had significantly more grade
retentions, most of which predated the actual diagnosis. Research has
shown that the national average of grade retentions in elementary school
ranges from 3-5%, which is well below the incidence rate in the MS
sample (18%). Present findings suggest that there may be an association between historical educational issues and later diagnosis of MS.
This may be indicative of early signs of cognitive dysfunction prior to
diagnosis of MS.

L. HARDER. Fatigue, Sleep, Quality of Life and Academic
Functioning in Pediatric Multiple Sclerosis (MS).
Objective: Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune disorder typically
diagnosed in adults; however, 2–5% of patients with MS experience
their first symptoms before age 18. Although many attempts have been
made to assess fatigue and sleep disturbances in adults with MS, little
is known about such problems in pediatric MS patients. Furthermore,
existing research has revealed inconsistent findings. The purpose of this
study was to determine if pediatric MS patients report significantly more
fatigue, as well as disturbances in quality of life and sleep, compared to a
normative sample. Study aims also include evaluation of the relationship
between these factors and academic functioning.
Participants and Methods: Forty-five MS participants, ages 8 to 18
years (mean=15.2), completed the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory
and the Multidimensional Fatigue Scale. Information on academic functioning was provided by caregivers. Participants were divided into two
groups based on level of school problems (history of retention, special
education enrollment, poor grades).
Results: One-sample t-tests revealed statistically significant differences
in pediatric MS patients from the population mean (p < 0.05) for general

fatigue, sleep/rest fatigue, cognitive fatigue, as well as physical, emotional, social, and school functioning. One-way ANOVA revealed statistically significant differences between school problems and no school
problems groups on self-report emotional F (1,41) = 4.51; p <.05 and
social functioning F (1,41) = 4.19; p <.05.
Conclusions: Results indicate pediatric MS patients are at risk for problems with fatigue and quality of life. Findings suggest a relationship
between academic functioning and social-emotional functioning. Results
highlight the need for a multi-disciplinary approach in the care of pediatric MS patients and regular surveillance of psychosocial functioning.
Additionally, results suggest potential opportunities for intervention and
further research.

A. FAYAD, A. TAN, B. GREENBERG & L. HARDER. Impact of
Fatigue, Sleep and Quality of Life on Cognition in Pediatric
Multiple Sclerosis (MS).
Objective: Fatigue and sleep problems are commonly reported symptoms associated with multiple sclerosis (MS). Although not as thoroughly
studied in pediatric MS, adult patients with MS report increased fatigue, which is associated with poor cognitive performance. Additionally,
sleep difficulties are associated with diminished quality of life and are
reported to independently predict mental and physical well-being in
adults with MS. Existing research suggests individuals with pediatric
MS experience many of these symptoms, but investigation of the relation between these variables remains limited. This study assesses the
association between measures of fatigue, sleep, and quality of life and
cognitive performance in pediatric MS.
Participants and Methods: Forty-five MS participants, ages 8 to 18
years (mean=15.2), and their caregivers completed the Pediatric Quality
of Life Inventory and the Multidimensional Fatigue Scale. Participants
also completed a brief neuropsychological screening battery as part of
their multi-disciplinary clinic visit.
Results: Caregiver and self-report cognitive fatigue, and physical and
emotional quality of life were positively correlated with verbal memory
(p<.05). Caregiver report of social and physical quality of life were also
positively correlated with processing speed and visual-motor integration
(p<.05). Multiple regression revealed that self-report cognitive fatigue
significantly predicted verbal memory scores (p<.05). Furthermore,
parent and self-report sleep/rest fatigue significantly predicted information processing speed (p<.05) and verbal memory scores (p<.05).
Conclusions: Results show an association between fatigue and quality
of life variables, and cognitive functioning that is generally consistent
with what is known about adult MS. In addition, these findings warrant
further investigation on the impact of intervention to address cognitive
fatigue and sleep to determine if such intervention will improve cognitive
functioning in pediatric MS.

Temperature is Associated with Better Cognitive Efficiency in
Relapsing-Remitting Multiple Sclerosis: A Multi-Center Study.
Objective: In 1938, Nathaniel Kleitman proposed that warmer body
temperature in healthy individuals enhances cognitive performance by
leading to increased metabolic activity of cells in the cerebral cortex
thereby increasing speed of thinking. Having recently provided the firstever report of elevated body temperature in patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS), we propose this clinical sample as
a natural in vivo model in which to observe the relationship of endogenously elevated body temperature to cognitive performance. Here, we

Forty Fourth Annual INS Meeting Abstracts
investigate the relationship of body temperature to cognitive efficiency
in three samples of RRMS patients.
Participants and Methods: RRMS patients from 3 sites served: New
York (n=26), New Jersey (n=82), and Rome, Italy (n=25). Body temperature was measured with an infrared aural thermometer. Mean body
temperature for each sample was elevated relative to published data for
healthy individuals (98.2°F): NY, 98.7°F; NJ, 98.4°F; Rome, 98.4°F.
Cognitive efficiency was measured with the Symbol Digit Modalities
Test (SDMT; age-adjusted scores were used). For each sample, we examined partial correlations (controlling for age) of body temperature
and cognitive efficiency.
Results: Warmer body temperature was associated with better cognitive
efficiency in each sample; R-values were .401 (NY), .317 (NJ), and
.405 (Rome).
Conclusions: Our findings suggest a relationship of warmer body temperature and enhanced cognitive efficiency. They also highlight the
distinction between benefits of elevated body temperature and the detrimental effect of exogenous heat stress on cognitive performance that
has been demonstrated in healthy humans and in MS patients (i.e.,
Uhthoff’s phenomenon), including our own work showing an association
of warmer outdoor temperature to worse cognitive performance in MS
patients. Future work is needed to delineate this endogenous/exogenous
distinction of heat’s impact on cognition.

Association between Cognitive Complaints and Vulnerability to
Environmental Distration in Multiple Sclerosis.
Objective: Individuals with multiple sclerosis often report cognitive
complaints, although neuropsychological testing may not correlate with
subjective concerns. One factor that may explain this lack of correspondence is the controlled testing environment, which differs from busier
settings where cognitive lapses are noted to occur. The present study
used a novel environmental manipulation to determine whether individuals with MS who report cognitive dysfunction are more vulnerable
to the effects of auditory distraction during neuropsychological testing.
Participants and Methods: Twenty individuals with clinically definite MS and two with clinically isolated syndrome were administered
a cognitive battery during two counterbalanced auditory conditions:
1) quiet/standard condition, and 2) distraction condition with random
office background noise. Participants were divided into age-matched
high vs. low cognitive complaint groups using a median split analysis of
Perceived Deficits Questionnaire responses. Mean difference scores were
computed to determine the effects of quiet vs. noisy auditory conditions
on performance.
Results: Participants with more cognitive complaints showed a decrement in performance on the oral SDMT during the distraction condition
(average of 6 fewer completed items), whereas those with fewer cognitive
complaints demonstrated stable performance across conditions (average
difference of < 1 item; p < .05). These findings remained significant
after controlling for education, premorbid intellect, fatigue, and depressed mood. Complaint group comparisons for other measures were
not significant, although a trend was noted for the SDMT written trial.
Conclusions: These findings suggest that individuals with MS with
cognitive complaints are vulnerable to environmental distraction, particularly regarding cognitive efficiency. Incorporating random environmental noise during testing may enhance the ecological validity of neuropsychological evaluation results with MS and possibly other patients.

C.A. ROMAN, N.V. GARCIA & P. ARNETT. Structural Correlates
of Emotion Processing in Multiple Sclerosis.
Objective: Affective processes, such as emotion processing, have been
shown to be impaired in multiple sclerosis (MS). These deficits are
thought to emerge, in part, from the degradation of frontoparietal and
subcortical regions, such as the parietal and frontal cortices, and the
hippocampus, amygdala, cingulate gyrus. Therefore, the current study
aims to examine the relationship between these areas and performance
on an affective face processing task.
Participants and Methods: Thirty-eight individuals with MS (13m,
25f) were scanned during a functional and structural neuroimaging
protocol. Behavioral data were collected during an emotion processing
task known to evoke robust responses in cortico-subcortico regions (described in Passamonti et al., 2009). Participants were asked to complete
six neutral blocks (i.e., shape matching) and six emotion blocks (i.e.,
face-affect matching). Accuracy and reaction time (RT) were calculated for each condition. High-resolution T1-weighted scans were also
acquired and processed using FreeSurfer to obtain volumetric values
for the hippocampus, amygdala, anterior cingulate, as well as cortical
thickness values for the superior parietal and superior frontal areas.
Results: Multiple regression analyses were conducted controlling for sex
and intracranial volume. Significant relationships (at least p<.05) were
found between emotion-associated variables (i.e., number of correctly-matched emotions and RT) and the left and right hippocampi, right
amygdala volumes, and left superior parietal cortex, such that larger
volume and thickness were associated with a greater number of correct
responses and faster RT.
Conclusions: This is one of the first studies to examine the relationship
between affective-associated brain areas and emotion processing in MS.
These data point to the role of subcortical and parietal areas in emotion
processing in MS. Future research should examine the role of depression
in these relationships.

on Cognition in Persons with Multiple Sclerosis.
Objective: Exercise training represents a promising approach for managing cognitive impairment in persons with multiple sclerosis (MS).
There is preliminary evidence that treadmill walking might be the modality of exercise that exerts the greatest beneficial effects on inhibitory
control in fully-ambulatory persons with MS. However, the dose-dependent effects of varying intensities of treadmill walking exercise on
this cognitive function are unknown. Such an investigation is critical for
better delineating the optimal exercise stimulus for improving inhibitory
control in MS.
Participants and Methods: The present study compared the acute
effects of light, moderate, and vigorous intensity treadmill walking exercise on inhibitory control (i.e., interference control) relative to quiet
rest in 24 fully-ambulatory persons with MS, using a within-subjects,
repeated-measures experimental design. Participants completed 4 experimental conditions that consisted of 20 minutes of light, moderate,
and vigorous intensity treadmill walking exercise, and quiet rest in a
randomized, counterbalanced order. Participants underwent a modified
flanker task as a measure of inhibitory control immediately prior to and
following each condition.
Results: Repeated-measures ANOVAs indicated large, statistically significant reductions in the cost of interfering stimuli on reaction time, but not accuracy, on the modified flanker task for light,
moderate, and vigorous intensity exercise compared with quiet rest
(F(3,69)=4.27,p=.01,ηp2=.16). There were no differences in magnitude of reduction across the three exercise intensities.
Conclusions: The present results support light, moderate, and vigorous
intensity treadmill walking as exercise stimuli that might particularly
benefit interference control of reaction time. This represents the next

150
step in delineating the optimal exercise stimuli for improving this cognitive function in fully-ambulatory persons with MS, and perhaps is
important for informing a subsequent longitudinal exercise training
intervention.

on Cognition in Multiple Sclerosis.
Objective: Prevalent non-motor changes in multiple sclerosis (MS) include executive dysfunction, chronic fatigue, depression and anxiety.
It is possible that one’s sense of hopefulness and well-being plays an
important role in cognition and emotional function. The purpose of this
study was to examine the relationship between self-reported optimism
and executive function in MS.
Participants and Methods: Forty one patients (28% males) with confirmed MS participated in this study. Participants were administered
a small battery assessing depression (BDI-II), anxiety (BAI), fatigue
(MFIS), general optimism (LOT-R), executive function (D-KEFS Sorting) and attentional processing (PASAT).
Results: Linear regression analyses revealed that responses on the
LOT-R, a measure of dispositional optimism, predicted a greater number of correct sorts on the D-KEFS Sorting test, and a higher percentage
of correct responses on the PASAT. The LOT-R predicted performance
on the D-KEFS Sorting test even after controlling for level of disability
(EDSS). No relationship was found between measures of fatigue, depression, or anxiety and the cognitive tasks.
Conclusions: Self-reported dispositional optimism, but not mood, fatigue, or anxiety, predicts cognitive functioning among MS patients.
While depression, anxiety, and fatigue are linked to quality of life and
cognitive performance, the current finding highlights the importance
of measuring positive outcome expectancies, as they may have unique,
important implications for healthy cognitive functioning.

A. MEANI, G. COMI & M. FILIPPI. Reading, Writing, and Reserve:
Literacy Activities are linked to Hippocampal Volume and Memory
in Multiple Sclerosis.
Objective: The cognitive reserve hypothesis posits that persons who
engage in mentally-stimulating lifestyles are at lower risk for subsequent
disease-related memory decline. Among persons with multiple sclerosis
(MS), we have linked engagement in cognitive activities (e.g., reading,
hobbies) during early adulthood to (a) lower risk for memory decline
and (b) larger hippocampal volume, which may represent a neuroanatomical basis for reserve. We now investigate which types of cognitive
activity are most beneficial.
Participants and Methods: MS patients from Italy (n=187) and the
United States (n=55) reported on early adult engagement in three types
of cognitive activities: reading-writing, art-music, games-hobbies. Patients underwent 3.0T MRIs to quantify hippocampal volume. In each
sample, stepwise regression (entry p=.05, removal p=.10) predicted
hippocampal volume with the three types of cognitive activity, controlling for demographics (including education). Memory was evaluated
in representative subsamples of Italian patients (n=97) with the SRT
and SPART, and American patients (n=53) with the SRT and BVMT-R.
The same regression was performed to predict memory in each sample.
Results: Greater engagement in reading-writing during early adulthood
was linked to larger hippocampal volume in Italian (rp=.240, p=.001)
and American (rp=.332, p=.018) samples. Art-music and games-hobbies did not contribute. Similarly, greater engagement in reading-writing was linked to preserved memory in Italian (rp=.245, p=.019) and

American (rp=.270, p=.063) samples. Art-music and games-hobbies
made little-to-no contribution.
Conclusions: Engagement in reading-writing activities during early
adulthood was linked to larger current hippocampal volume and
preserved memory. Findings inform the development of targeted evidence-based enrichment programs aiming to bolster reserve against
memory decline, which may provide causal evidence that cognitive reserve can be bolstered among persons with neurologic disease.

B.L. BANWELL. Age at onset predicts working memory following
acute demyelinating syndrome in children.
Objective: Acute demyelinating syndrome (ADS) may occur as a transient illness or, in approximately 25% of patients, it represents the
first attack of multiple sclerosis (MS). Cognitive dysfunction can occur
following CNS demyelination, with higher risk among children with MS
as compared with monophasic ADS (monoADS). Younger age at onset
may increase vulnerability to executive dysfunction due to interference
to normal CNS development. This study examined the relationship between age at incident demyelinating attack and working memory (WM)
in pediatric patients with monoADS and MS.
Participants and Methods: Participants included 42 patients with
ADS (monoADS: n = 30; MS: n = 12) aged 6-17 (mean=12.6 ± 3.3
yrs). WM was assessed using the Numbers Reversed and Auditory WM
subtests from the Woodcock-Johnson Tests of Cognitive Abilities. IQ
was assessed using the WASI. The association between age at ADS
onset (range 3.7-15.8 yrs) and WM was investigated using Spearman
correlation.
Results: Patients with MS had an older age at onset (13.0 ± 2.4 yrs) as
compared with the monoADS group (9.9 ± 3.3 yrs). Testing was conducted 19.0 ± 9.4 months from time of incident event in the monoADS
group and 20.7 ± 6.7 months in the MS group. IQ did not differ between
groups. Below average (<15th percentile) performance on either WM
test was demonstrated among 3/12 MS patients (25%) versus none of
the patients with monoADS (Χ2 = 8.1, p<.005). Contrary to our hypothesis, older age at onset correlated with worse performance on the
Auditory WM subtest in both the MS (r= -.63, p= .019) and monoADS
(r= -.34, p= .04) groups. The same trend was observed for the Numbers
Reversed subtest, but did not reach significance.
Conclusions: Poorer WM performance was observed among patients
with MS relative to monoADS. Older age at incident demyelinating event
correlated with worse WM. Whether this finding is due to maturational
or structural differences associated with age at disease onset should be
explored.

J. ZAMZOW, J.D. KLOSS, E. CULNAN & M.T. SCHULTHEIS. The
Association Between Sleep Disorder Symptoms and Cognitive
Function in Relapsing-Remitting Multiple Sclerosis.
Objective: Individuals with multiple sclerosis (MS) experience a high
rate of sleep disorders, which have been negatively associated with cognitive function in the general population. This study may identify potential targets for intervention aimed at improving cognitive function in MS.
Participants and Methods: 41 individuals with relapsing-remitting
(RR) MS were administered the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), the STOP BANG questionnaire for sleep
apnea and Global Sleep Assessment Questionnaire (GSAQ) for restless
legs syndrome (RLS) and periodic limb movement disorder (PLMD).
Participants also completed tasks assessing attention (DKEFs trails:
sequencing), set-shifting (DKEFS trails: switching) inhibition (Stroop),
working memory (PASAT, N-Back), processing speed (symbol digit

Forty Fourth Annual INS Meeting Abstracts
modality test [SDMT]), verbal fluency (COWAT) and verbal memory
(Selective Reminding Test).
Results: Preliminary analyses revealed ISI was associated with working
memory (PASAT, r = -.30, p = .04). ESS correlated with working memory (PASAT, r = -.44, p < .01) and attention (DKEFS, r = -.36, p = .01).
STOP BANG was associated with processing speed (SDMT, r = -.31, p =
.03) and working memory (PASAT, r = -.50, p < .01, NBACK r = -.64,
p < .01). RLS and PLMD symptoms were associated with processing
speed (SDMT r = -.54, p < .01) working memory (PASAT, r = -.38, p =
.01, NBACK r = -.40, p < .01), semantic fluency (r = -.35, p = .02) and
attention (DKEFS sequencing, r = .37, p = .01). All correlations reflected
poorer performance associated with greater sleep disorder symptomology. There were no significant associations between symptoms of sleep
disorders and verbal memory, inhibition, or set-shifting.
Conclusions: Among individuals with RR-MS, sleep disorder symptoms
were associated with compromised attention, verbal fluency, processing
speed and working memory. Sleep disorders are treatable and may serve
as a modifiable risk factor for cognitive impairment in MS.

M.D. ZUPPICHINI, H.M. GENOVA & J. SANDRY. Structural White
Matter Differences related to Learning and Memory Impairment
in Multiple Sclerosis: An Exploratory DTI Analysis.
Objective: Learning and memory impairment is common in multiple
sclerosis (MS). This study aimed to (1) replicate recent research suggesting that working memory capacity (WMC) is related to learning
and memory impairment in MS and (2) use diffusion tensor imaging
to investigate differences between white matter tracts in MS participants with and without memory impairment. Based on past research we
hypothesized that memory-impaired participant’s would show greater
diffusion in white matter tracts that have been correlated with verbal
working memory, including the left superior longitudinal fasciculus
(SLF) frontal-parietal white matter tract.
Participants and Methods: 31 MS and 20 healthy control (HC) participants with neuropsychological tests and structural neuroimaging
scans. WMC was estimated using Digit Span Total and Letter Number
Sequencing. Memory-impairment was defined as scoring 1 or more standard deviations below the HC mean on the number of trials to criterion
on the Open-Trial Selective Reminding Test (OT-SRT). Fractional
anisotropy (FA) was calculated using tract-based spatial statistics in
FSL. White matter differences were analyzed using a 3D t-test in AFNI.
Results: WMC was negatively correlated with the OT-SRT for MS participants (r=-0.53, p<.05) but not for HCs (p=n.s.). Memory-impaired
MS participants had lower FA values (higher diffusion) in the left SLF
as well as the corticospinal tract, forceps major, forceps minor, and the
right anterior thalamic radiation
Conclusions: WMC was related to learning and memory in MS but
not in HCs. Memory-impaired MS participants had lower FA (higher
diffusion) in the SLF, which has been implicated in working memory.
These findings provide corroboratory structural neuroimaging evidence
that disconnectivity in white matter tracts related to working memory
may contribute to learning and memory-impairment in MS

Cognitive Intervention/Rehabilitation
T.F. BERGQUIST, D. KLUNK, C. GREEN, K. KRISHNAN &
A. BROWN. Relationship between Injury Severity and Outcome
in Adults with Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) Receiving Post-Acute
Rehabilitation.
Objective: Analyze association between injury severity and outcome in
adults with traumatic brain injury (TBI) undergoing post-acute brain
rehabilitation.
Participants and Methods: Participants were 56 patients receiving
post-acute rehabilitation after TBI. Mean age=46.68 years, SD=16.71;
52% male. Using the Mayo Classification System for TBI severity, 59%
were classified as Definite, 25% as Probable, and 16% as Possible.
Patients classified as Probable/Possible were grouped together to create
two similarly sized samples. All patients completed the Participation Index from the Mayo-Portland Adaptability Index (M2PI), Patient Health
Questionnaire (PHQ-9), and Satisfaction with Life Scale (SWLS) at
admission and dismissal.
Results: Over the course of treatment the M2PI, SWLS, and PHQ-9
improved significantly (p<0.001; p<0.028; p<0.001) for all patients
in this study. When broken down by injury severity, there were no
significant differences between SWLS scores over time for patients in
Definite or Probable/Possible classifications, but patients in both groups
scored significantly lower on the M2PI (p<0.001; p<0.003) and PHQ-9
(p<0.024; p<0.011) at dismissal. Definite TBI patients showed greater
improvement on the M2PI, whereas Probable/Possible TBI patients
showed greater improvement on SWLS and PHQ-9.
Conclusions: There was significant improvement in functioning, life
satisfaction, and mood following rehabilitation in all severity groups. Patients with Definite TBI reported greater functional improvement while
patients with Probable/Possible TBI reported increased life satisfaction
and fewer depressive symptoms at dismissal. Greater levels of participation restrictions on the M2PI at admission in the definite TBI group
and more depressive symptoms and lower life satisfaction at admission
in the Probable/Possible group allow more room for improvement in
these areas respectively.

F.E. RAMIREZ & N. NEDLEY. Use of oral lavander oil for anxiety
in a depression medical residential program.
Objective: Evaluate the effectiveness of lavander oil during a 10 day
intensive medical depression and anxiety program.
Participants and Methods: Data was collected from 368 patients that
finished the 10 day program. The 10-program took place in Oklahoma
and California, interventions included medical, nutritional, exercise
physiologist, psychology and spiritual. From the 368, 30 patients with
severe anxiety were selected to use lavander oil up to 3 times a day PRN.
The average age of participants was 43 SD 16.5. Participants came
from 11 countries, 80% Caucasian, 3.5% African American, 2% Asian,
4% blacks from the Caribbean, 8% Hispanics, .5% native Americans.
Standardized depression and anxiety tests were applied at baseline and
at the end of the 10 days.
Results: From the 30 patients that took lavander oil, average Beck
Anxiety Inventory (BAI) at baseline was 23.5 SD 12.9, by the end of the
10 days average BAI was 10.5 SD 6.8. From the 337 that didn’t take
the lavander oil at baseline, mean BAI was 16.4 SD 10.4 by the end of
the 10 days mean BAI was 6.5 SD 6.5.
Conclusions: Lavander oil seems to be effective in decreasing anxiety
in severe anxiety cases. Some patients reported gastrointestinal reflux
while using it. More cases should be documented.

Dementia (Alzheimer’s Disease)
A.M. BRYANT & J. SUHR. Family History of Alzheimer’s Disease
Predicts Performance on Executive Functioning Measures in
Cognitively Intact Adults.
Objective: Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) affects more than 5.2 million
Americans. As the population continues to live longer, early diagnosis
becomes increasingly important. Focus on memory decline remains at
the forefront of AD research; however, other cognitive domains, such
as executive functioning (EF) may be of diagnostic utility. Previous research has demonstrated EF tests are sensitive at differentiating healthy
controls from those with AD, and a recent study showed that healthy
older adults with a family history (FH) of AD performed worse on the
Wisconsin Card Sorting Test. The purpose of the present study was to
examine whether healthy older adults with a FH of AD performed worse
on other EF measures.
Participants and Methods: Participants were healthy, cognitively intact older adults (39% male, 60-87 years old, average college educated)
with a first-degree FH of AD (n = 14) or no known FH of AD (n = 43).
All were participants in a larger study of cognitive correlates of driving.
EF measures included Semantic Fluency, Coding, Trail Making Test B
(TMT-B), Matrix Reasoning (MR), DKEFS Color-Word Interference
Task, and N-Back.
Results: There were no significant differences between groups on gender, age, or years of education (all p’s > .05). Several hierarchical linear
regressions were conducted with performance on EF measures as the
dependent variable on Step 2, while controlling for age, sex, and years
of education on Step 1. Family History accounted for significant variance in performance on TMT-B (β= .341, p = .003, ΔR2 = .114) and
MR (β= -.301, p = .019, ΔR2 = .090); however, FH did not account for
significant variance on all other EF measures.
Conclusions: These results demonstrate measurable EF performance
differences in cognitively intact older adults with a first-degree FH of
AD and those without a FH of AD. As such, EF measures may be of
clinical utility for early detection of AD. Memory decline remains the
hallmark symptom of AD, yet given its insidious onset, other sensitive
tests should continue to be researched.

Content- and Context-Component Memory Task Performance in
Elderly Individuals with Subjective Cognitive Decline.
Objective: The issues of whether the manifestation of subjective cognitive/memory decline (SCD/SMD) deserves one of the diagnostic inclusions of amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) and it can also be
deemed as an individual entity other than the prodromal Alzheimer’s
disease (AD)- aMCI remain disputable. Literature shows that associative
memory is dissociable into content and context components. Accordingly, the present study was to explore the controversial issues based
on such a memory concept.
Participants and Methods: A total of 189 individuals comprising 5
subject groups, SCD (n =41), aMCI-single domain (aMCI-sd, n = 38),
aMCI-multiple domain (aMCI-md, n = 33), dementia of Alzheimer’s
type (DAT, n = 39), and healthy control (n=38) groups were recruited in
the present study. All participants received the modified Family Pictures
subtest and their performances were further differentiated into content
and context components.
Results: Compared to healthy controls’ performance with a cut-off
point of 7th percentile rank (around 1.5 SD below mean) as a defective
performance, the proportion of impaired performance on the content-related memory was higher than that of context-related memory tasks
in participants with SCD (22% vs. 4.9%), aMCI-sd (37% vs. 13%),
aMCI-md (55% vs. 30%) and DAT (59% vs. 36%).
Conclusions: The results revealed the heterogeneity of content and
context memory functioning pictures evident in individuals with
SCD, partly supporting the SCD as a manifestation involved in aMCI

diagnosis, and also a meaningful concept independent of aMCI. Both
memory-component evaluations thus appear to have respectively clinical utilities to AD in terms of the disease-progression monitoring and
memory remediation.

K.N. SPALDING, E. GUZMÁN-VÉLEZ, J.P. HESKJE, K.K. WIGGS
& D. TRANEL. Two-Day Intervention Significantly Reduces Stress
in Dementia Caregivers.
Objective: Providing care for a person with dementia can lead to decline
in psychological and physical health (e.g., increased stress, depression,
anxiety, compromised immune response). There is an immense need to
provide treatment for caregiver burden; however, most current behavioral interventions are costly and time-consuming. The present study
investigated the effectiveness of a low cost, two-day intervention in
reducing caregiver burden.
Participants and Methods: Primary caregivers of an individual with
dementia were randomly assigned to a two-day intervention group
(N=22) or a waitlist- control group (N=18). The intervention focused
on acceptance, compassion, mindfulness, and “meeting the individual
in their reality,” through the use of improvisation techniques. At baseline, participants completed questionnaires regarding caregiver burden,
stress, symptoms of anxiety and depression, and distress caused by the
patient’s psychiatric symptoms. Questionnaires were re-administered by
mail one and three months following the completion of the intervention.
Results: Results from a repeated-measures ANOVA indicate a significant reduction in perceived stress over time for the intervention group,
but not for the control group, F(31)=4.25, p=.023, when controlling for
caregiver education and dementia stage. Additionally, there were trends
for reduced anxiety, depression, and caregiver burden, although these
findings were not statistically significant.
Conclusions: A low cost two-day intervention has been shown to effectively reduce perceived stress in caregivers up to three months after the
intervention. Although caregivers continued to have objective symptoms
of depression and anxiety, it appears these symptoms had a reduced
impact on their overall perception of stress, and participants felt better
able to cope with caregiving. These findings suggest that it is possible
to have a lasting impact on dementia caregiver quality of life with an
accessible, low cost, brief intervention.

J. MACHAC & H.A. BENDER. The Neuropsychological Profile
and Neuroimaging Biomarkers in a Patient with Corticobasal
Syndrome with Underlying Alzheimer’s Pathology: A Case Study.
Objective: This case study describes the neuropsychological and behavioral profile of a 57-year old Arabic speaking woman, experiencing
a rapidly progressive, 3 year decline in speech and language, executive
function, and motor abilities. The patient was previously diagnosed
with Alzheimer’s disease (AD) based on neurologist review and an FDGPET revealing moderate bilateral hypometabolism in parietotemporal
areas. However, the patient’s relatively strong memory was atypical for
AD, as was her prominent motor-related symptoms. Despite additional
neuroimaging biomarkers (Florbetapir F-18) indicating AD, her clinical course and cognitive profile was instead suggestive of Corticobasal
Syndrome with underlying Alzheimer’s disease pathology (CBS-AD).
Participants and Methods: A limited battery of cognitive metrics was
administered due to the patient’s profound cognitive difficulties and
cultural/linguistic limitations. The patient was administered the Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status and
the Dementia Rating Scale-2.

Forty Fourth Annual INS Meeting Abstracts
Results: The results of the evaluation were suggestive of widespread
neurocognitive dysfunction (i.e., profound frontal systems dysfunction,
visual perceptual deficits, and impaired motor skills), with relative sparing of learning and memory. A neurobehavioral/motor examination
revealed myoclonus, cog-wheeling, postural imbalance, akinetic UE
rigidity, and utilization behavior. Contrary to the working diagnosis of
AD with supporting biomarkers, the patient’s clinical course and cortical
signs with extrapyramidal involvement suggested a neuropathologically
distinct disorder, CBS-AD.
Conclusions: The literature documenting CBS-AD is limited, with
study of individual cases highly valuable in understanding the cognitive, motor and behavioral sequelae unique to this rare disorder. Even in
cases where neuroimaging biomarkers are consistent with AD, improved
understanding of CBS-AD may facilitate earlier identification and, by
extension, swifter, more targeted interventions.

F.E. RAMIREZ, P. GRILO & N. NEDLEY. Lead Exposure and
Mental Health.
Objective: The study researches a link between the exposure to lead via
water pipes and mental health, before and after an 8-week depression
and anxiety recovery program.
Participants and Methods: Data obtained from 5621 participants
that finished the 8-week program was used. Participant demographic
were 86% white, 4% black, 6.5% Hispanic and 3% Asian, average age
52.6 SD 15. The educational program meet every week for a 2 hour
session, participants watched a pre-recorded lecture by a mental health
professional during the first hour, in the second hour lifestyle topics
are discussed in small groups. At baseline and at the end, every participant filled out a 75 item questionnaire to measure depression using
a modified PHQ-9 [patient health questionnaire], anxiety, emotional
intelligence and demographics together with patient history including
the question “Does your house have any lead pipes or water hoses used
for drinking water?”. Lifestyle concepts were taught like physical exercise, diet, rest, etc.
Results: From 5621 participants, 6.4% (n=359) answered positively
the lead pipes question. At baseline these participants presented a depression group average of 14.7 (moderate) SD 7, anxiety of 8 (mild) SD
4.4. At baseline those without a lead exposure had a depression group
average of 12.2 (moderate) SD 7.5 and anxiety of 7 (mild) SD 4.6. At
the end of the program 5.2% (n=294) reported lead exposure, with a
depression average of 8.3 (mild) SD 6.4, anxiety of 4.7 (mild) SD 4. The
other participants without exposure to lead had a depression average of
6.4 (none) SD 5.9, anxiety 3.7 (none) SD 3.6.
Conclusions: At the beginning participants that reported lead exposure
had 17% higher depression and 12.5% higher anxiety. Both groups
improved with the program. At the end, the group without lead exposure had 22% less depression and 10.6% less anxiety. Lead exposure
screening is advised.

Epilepsy/Seizures
K.D. SRNKA, D. JACKSON, J. JONES, D. ALMANE, B.P. HERMANN
& M. SEIDENBERG. Examination of Attention “Stability” in
Children with Recent Onset Epilepsy.
Objective: Attentional impairment is a common neuropsychological
co-morbidity of childhood onset epilepsy (COE). Mirsky proposed a

153
4-factor attention model which has proven useful in examining attention
processes in various clinical populations, including epilepsy. Recently, a
fifth factor was added, Stabilize, a measure of intra-individual variability (IIV). We compared the performance of a COE group and a non-epilepsy cousin control group on IIV and also examined the relationship of
the Stabilize factor to IQ and academic achievement in COE.
Participants and Methods: 133 COE, average age 12 years, 49%
males, mean onset 11.3 years of age, and 54% with localization-related
epilepsy, and 92 first degree healthy cousins (HC) were administered
the Connors CPT -2 (CPT-2). Inclusion criteria for COE: diagnosis of
epilepsy within the previous year, minimum IQ of 70, and attendance
at regular school program. The Hit rate SE Block change and variability indices from the CPT-2 were used to measure the Stabilize factor.
Regression analyses examined the relationship between the Stabilize
factor and both intellectual functioning (Verbal and Performance IQ
from the WASI) and academic achievement (WRAT).
Results: No significant group differences in age or gender distribution
were found (p’s > .05). COE group showed significantly higher Stabilize
scores (increased variability) than the HC group (p<.001). Hierarchical
regression showed a significant increase in predicted variance for the
Stabilize factor for Performance IQ (β =-.30, p< .05), Word recognition
(β=-.25, p < .05), and Arithmetic (β= -.21, P< .05), after accounting for
age, gender, epilepsy syndrome, and time since last seizure.
Conclusions: Findings provide some preliminary validity support, discriminant and predictive, for the Stabilize factor in COE. Additional
research is needed to determine the potential value of the Stabilize
factor in childhood epilepsy in the study of attention ability in childhood epilepsy

Symposium 7. Advances in Understanding the
Organization and Cognitive/Behavioral Functions
of the Cerebellum
Chair: Carol L. Armstrong
Discussant: Mark Mahone

9:15–10:45 a.m.
C.L. ARMSTRONG. Advances in Understanding the Organization
and Cognitive/Behavioral Functions of the Cerebellum.
Symposium Description: The cerebellum has a differentially longer
and steeper developmental trajectory, potent neural stem cells, and rapid
learning capacity. It is relevant to the cognitive outcomes of many neurological disorders. It’s role in human non-motor cognition is recognized,
but more empirical support and understanding is needed.
Cognitive, emotional, and behavioral disorders observed after cerebellar
injury are multifactorial, and do not often present a delimited or eloquent syndrome or dysfunction. While neuroimaging studies suggest a
relationship of covaried cerebellar asymmetry with cerebral asymmetry,
this relationship may not result in predictable functional impairments.
For example, injury within the cerebellar vermis, part of the archicerebellum, may result in a complex and varied syndrome of complex
neurobehavioral disturbances.
This symposium will provide several lines of evidence on the neuroimaging, neuropsychiatric, and neurocognitive outcomes of cerebellar injury
that test assumptions about the influence of the cerebellum in complex
human behavior. C. Limperopoulos will present groundbreaking investigations on relatively subtle cerebellar abnormalities early in life, which
present multi-dimensional disabilities later in life. K. Walsh will present
findings on the cerebellar mutism syndrome and the cerebellar cognitive
affective syndrome, which are disturbances of wide rang-ing neuropsychological behaviors in children and adults, whose neural pathways are

154
still debated. D. Smith will present an investigation of the reported functional asymmetry of cerebellar injury on complex cognitive behaviors
using widely used clinical neuropsychological tests. C. Armstrong will
present the risk for mood disorders from cerebellar lesions.
We will use empirical findings to articulate predicted neurocognitive
and neuropsychiatric outcomes of injury to cerebellar-cortical tracts.
Results will be discussed in the contexts of Schmahmann’s and Ito’s
models of cerebellar function.

(CMS-) mutism as early as 1 year from treatment, with the CMS+ groups
showing substantially lower IQ (Study 1 CMS+ = 87 [16.4], CMS- =
97 [15.9]; Study 2 CMS+ =78 [19.8]; CMS- =89 [26.5]) and require
greater supports by that time point (CMS+ Spec Ed=60%; CMS- 29%).
In a matched case series, we again show discrepancies at 1 year, particularly for nonverbal functions (CMS+ PIQ=79 [6.1]; CMS- PIQ=111
[8.3]), with 80% of CMS+ children showing clinical impairments and
but none of the CMS- children. A similar pattern was observed for
executive functions. We show data for a possible acceleration and intensification of cognitive late effects in this unique population of children.

C. LIMPEROPOULOS. The vulnerable immature cerebellum:
Structural and functional consequences following early-life
injury.
Cerebellar development follows a highly regulated program of critical
developmental processes. This vulnerable developmental period can be
derailed by a host of potential insults. Recently, we have pioneered
high-resolution quantitative MRI (qMRI) techniques to study the developmental trajectory of the cerebellum in utero. Using qMRI during
the third trimester of pregnancy, we have demonstrated that the cerebellum undergoes its most rapid growth unsurpassed by any other
cerebral structure over the same time period. However, this accelerated
growth is impeded by premature birth, where many of these critical
development events take place within the hazards of early exposure
to the extra-uterine environment. Despite the increased recognition of
cerebellar injury in survivors of extreme preterm birth, the structural
and functional consequences of cerebellar injury have been largely unexplored. Our data suggest that both direct and indirect mechanisms
of cerebellar injury arrest cerebellar development, lead to secondary
remote cortical impairments, and a high-prevalence of multidimensional
disabilities by school age including: cognitive deficits, executive dysfunction, language impairments and social-behavioral dysfunction including
autism spectrum disorders. We will explore the emerging functional
topography of the immature cerebellum using qMRI, demonstrate how
prematurity-related cerebellar injury can alter cerebellar development,
and examine the long-term structural-functional correlates. Finally we
will appraise the current opportunities and limitations afforded by qMRI
for studying early life injury to the developing cerebellum and the role
of qMRI for identifying early imaging-biomarkers for later neurodevelopmental disabilities.

D. SMITH, C.L. ARMSTRONG & M.J. FISHER. The Paradox of
Cerebellar Lateralization of Cognitive Function.
Involvement of the cerebellum (CB) in non-motor cognitive tasks has
gained widespread acceptance within the neuroscience community.
Recent anatomical studies reveal close connections from the posterior
hemispheres to contralateral cortical association areas. Functional
imaging reveals co-activation of the CB during tasks from a range of
non-motor domains (e.g., right CB activation during language tasks). In
the clinical setting, patients with large lesions of the CB may present with
absent or subtle cognitive impairments, presenting a paradox between
the literature and the applied setting. The only studies to date investigating the differential effects of CB hemispheric damage in children
suffer from small sample size. In the present retrospective study, data
from comprehensive neuropsychological assessments were examined for
lateralization effects in 38 children having tumors definitively in the
left, right, or central/bilateral hemispheres of the CB. Children with
CB lesions performed similarly to the normative groups (mean z-score
= -0.10, SD=1.26) except in tasks requiring a motor component such
as grooved pegboard (mean z-score = -1.30, SD=1.48). The only tasks
showing differences in hemispheric tumor locus were phonemic fluency
and right hemisphere (F = 3.38, p = 0.04) and backwards digit span
and bilateral/central injury (F = 3.83, p = 0.03). While the results
were commensurate with prior investigations, showing that patients with
right CB injury perform more poorly on measures of phonemic fluency
(z-scores: left = 0.83; central = -0.37; right = -0.62) and patients with
bilateral injury have greater deficits in backwards digit span (z-scores:
left = 0.54; central = -0.47, right = 0.06), the pattern of findings would
not be considered clinically significant. Results will be discussed in the
context of current developmental and anatomic frameworks with emphasis placed on the utility of the standard neuropsychological battery
in detecting cerebellar injury.

K. WALSH. Cerebellar Cognitive Affective Syndrome in Pediatric
Neuro-Oncology: Intensification and Acceleration of Emerging
Late Effects.
The importance of the cerebellum in higher order neuropsychological
function has become increasingly clear. Volumetric and functional disruptions in the cerebellum impact the integrity of the dorsal cognitive
circuit and this is likely one contributing factor in the emergence and
presence of the neuropsychological sequelae. The description of the
Cerebellar Cognitive Affective Syndrome (CCAS) in adults described the
constellation of cognitive and affective symptoms seen with cerebellar
dysfunction and has become increasingly incorporated into pediatric
nomenclature. About 25% of children with cerebellar tumor undergoing
resection exhibit acute symptoms of mutism, ataxia, hypotonia, and
emotional lability following surgery (Cerebellar Mutism Syndrome).
These children exemplify the CCAS in pediatrics. There is emerging
evidence that these children may exhibit more significant neuropsychological late effects that may emerge sooner than is typical in children
treated for brain tumor. We show that children who present with CMS
following surgery have significantly greater atrophy and gliosis on imaging at 1 year than those without CMS. In two separate studies significant differences were shown between those with (CMS+) and without

C.L. ARMSTRONG. Mood Disorders Related to Cerebellar
Activation and Cerebellar Injury.
In addition to impaired executive dysfunction causing behavioral dyscontrol, cerebellar lesions, both hemispheric and vermal, can present as
mood disturbance. Differential cerebellar activation has been found for
positive and negative induced moods, and for negative mood disorders.
A current model proposes that the cerebellum is involved in the regulation of emotional perception and encoding, to maintain synchrony of
multiple information processing streams (Schmahmann and Schutter).
The cortico-cerebellar association with depression and anxiety was
examined in a sample (n=91) of children with brain tumors. Analyses revealed that 29% had clinically elevated anxiety, which exceeds
the frequency in the general population, and 8% had elevated depression. Patients with right cortical tumors or left cerebellar tumors had
significantly greater anxiety than those with midline/bilateral tumors
and those with left cortical or right cerebellar tumors (F(2,99)=6.35,
p=0.006), with little correlation with depressive symptoms. A second
study examined the cerebellar lesion patients only (L, R, Bil/Mid) in
two separate cohorts (n=21, and 23), and though the left cerebellar

Forty Fourth Annual INS Meeting Abstracts
group had highest anxiety, the F was not significant in either cohort.
The neuropsychological effect may be significant only when including
the cortical lesions, suggesting a synergistic effect caused by diaschisis.
Neuropsychiatric and mood disturbances are inconsistently associated
with cerebellar syndromes and lesions, for example in Friedreich’s
ataxia. The strength of association of impaired mood with different
cerebellar syndromes/lesions will be presented. The risk of mood disturbance across syndrome and lesion studies suggests a differential role
for the cerebellum in emotional and affective disturbance, and in lesion
vs. degenerative disorders.

of Biomarkers and Memory Test Scores Provide Empirical Support
for Preclinical AD Staging and Non-AD Cognitive Decline in Late
Middle Age: Findings from the WRAP Study.
Objective: Preclinical Alzheimer’s disease (pAD) is characterized by
progressive amyloidosis, neurodegeneration, and cognitive impairment
(CI). Clustering of biomarkers and neuropsychological test scores may
be helpful in staging pAD and subsequent decline.
Participants and Methods: 103 cognitively healthy adults (mean
age 61) enriched with genetic and parental family history (FH) risk
for AD from the WRAP cohort underwent PET-PiB imaging of brain
beta-amyloid (Aβ), MRI, lumbar puncture, and cognitive testing. Hierarchical clustering grouped subjects based on 4 disease indicators:
total-tau (t-tau) and Aβ42 cerebrospinal fluid levels, PiB burden, and
RAVLT delayed recall score. Clusters were compared by post hoc tests
with multivariate ANOVA on clustering variables and demographics,
and by ANCOVA, controlling for age, sex, APOE4, and FH, on several
concurrent pAD-related measures: hippocampal volume (intracranial
volume-corrected), atrophy, total white matter hyperintensity lesion
volume (WMH), and a different memory test, WMS-R Logical Memory
I and II (additionally controlling for literacy).
Results: The 5 derived clusters were characterized as healthy (n=42),
pAD stage 1 (low Aβ42; n=11), pAD stage 2 (low Aβ42, high PiB, high
t-tau; n=12), suspected non-pAD CI (low RAVLT scores; n=13), and
tauopathy (high t-tau; n=24). As expected, clusters differed significantly
on all clustering biomarkers (p<.001). Differences were not detected
for age, sex, APOE4, FH, literacy, hippocampal volume, or atrophy.
Suspected non-pAD CI had elevated WMH compared to all other clusters
(p<.05), suggesting a better cluster characterization is vascular-mediated CI. Vascular-mediated CI and pAD stage 2 consistently scored
worse on WMS immediate and delayed recall (p<.05).
Conclusions: Cluster analysis, which does not rely on arbitrary cutpoints or long-term trajectory, successfully identified preclinical stages
of AD and suspected non-AD etiology for the first time in midlife. Clinical endpoints can confirm the diagnostic accuracy of these clusters.

Neuropsychology of Biomarker-Defined Preclinical Stages of
Alzheimer’s Disease.
Objective: Furthering our understanding of the relationship between
amyloidosis (Aβ) on PET imaging, neurodegeneration (ND), and cognition is imperative for early identification and early intervention in
Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Previous research has shown that individuals
with both Aβ and ND show decline on cognitive composites. In line
with this, our goal is to determine whether individuals with Aβ and ND
show decline on particular neuropsychological measures and/or in a
domain-specific manner and whether Aβ and ND together or in isolation
are associated with different neuropsychological profiles longitudinally.
Participants and Methods: A total of 270 clinically normal older
adults from the Harvard Aging Brain study were grouped according to
preclinical AD stages: Stage 0 (Aβ-/ND-), Stage 1 (Aβ+/ND-), Stage
2 (Aβ+/ND+), and suspected non-Alzheimer’s associated pathology
(SNAP; Aβ-/ND+). Linear mixed models controlling for age, sex and
education were used to examine cognition over a mean of 2.42 years
across multiple measures and domains including Memory (6-trial SRT,
FCSRT), Language (BNT, category fluency), Executive Functioning
(TMT A and B, Digit Span, D-S Coding, letter fluency), and Visuospatial Skills (Visual Form Discrimination). Pairwise comparisons between
preclinical stages were explored.
Results: Stage 2 showed consistent decline across multiple domains
including decline in memory, language, and executive functioning; while
basic attention and visuospatial processing were preserved. In Stage 1,
there was a decline in language (category fluency and naming) and on
one memory measure (FCSRT). Stage 0 and SNAP remained cognitively
stable.
Conclusions: The combination of Aβ and ND appears to drive longitudinal decline in a clinical pattern consistent with AD. Some changes
in language and memory functions are already observable in Stage 1,
while Stage 0 and SNAP are associated with cognitive stability.

A.M. BRICKMAN & J. MANLY. Socioeconomic and Educational
Factors Account for Racial Inequities in Dementia Incidence in a
Community Dwelling Population.
Objective: Some studies show greater dementia risk and faster rates
of cognitive decline among racial and ethnic minorities in the U.S.
compared to whites. However, the magnitude and determinants of
this health inequity are debated. The current study compares rates of
dementia incidence and subsequent cognitive decline among elderly
African-Americans, Hispanics, and whites to determine whether observed differences can be explained by educational, socioeconomic, or
health-related factors.
Participants and Methods: Participants were 3,459 initially dementia-free older adults (30% African-American, 46% Hispanic, 24%
white) in the Washington Heights-Inwood Columbia Aging Project with
up to 24 years of follow-up (694 incident dementia cases). Cox proportional hazard models estimated the influence of baseline differences in
educational attainment, reading level, income, occupation, APOE status,
and comorbidities on dementia rates. Growth curve models estimated
cognitive trajectories post-diagnosis.
Results: Hispanics and African-Americans were more likely than whites
to be diagnosed with dementia (25.4% vs.19.6% vs. 10.5%). In an
unadjusted model, greater hazard ratios for dementia were found for
Hispanics (HR: 3.11) and for African-Americans (HR: 2.25) compared
to whites. When covariates were included in models, the elevated dementia risk compared to whites was attenuated among Hispanics (HR: 1.30)
and no longer significant among African-Americans (HR: 1.01). There
were no racial disparities in rates of cognitive decline post-diagnosis.

156
Conclusions: Our findings suggest that educational and socioeconomic
factors may account for higher rates of dementia observed in minority
racial and ethnic groups in the U.S. Factors which attenuated dementia
risk most for Hispanics were years of education and income level. For
African-Americans, reading level, a proxy for educational quality, had
the largest impact on diminishing dementia risk.

Asymptomatic Alzheimer’s Disease: Building a Better Resilience
Phenotype.
Objective: Limited empirical attention has focused on elucidating
factors underlying “asymptomatic” Alzheimer’s disease (AD) in which
individuals present with autopsy-confirmed pathological AD (plaques
and tangles) but without marked cognitive impairment. This project
sought to build on the reserve hypothesis by using a partial least square
(PLS) path model to quantify “AD resilience” (the degree to which an
individual’s neuropsychological performance outpaces expected performance given their level of AD biomarkers) as an endophenotype for
future genomic projects.
Participants and Methods: Data from 869 participants (301 normal,
432 with MCI, and 136 with AD) in the ADNI cohort were included in
analyses. Inclusion criteria required cerebrospinal fluid biomarker data,
a composite measure of memory and executive function, and a measure
of hippocampal volume. We used a PLS path model to quantify three
first-order latent traits – “cognitive reserve”, “brain reserve”, and “AD
resilience” – and one second-order latent trait – “global resilience”.
Resilience measures were calculated using baseline data and evaluated
by predicting diagnostic conversion. Post hoc analyses integrated longitudinal data into the PLS path model to build a more robust phenotype
for future aims.
Results: Only the “AD resilience” (OR = 0.34, p=7x10-16) and “global
resilience” (OR = 0.35, p = 5x10-12) metrics successfully predicted protection from future conversion. Further, when including longitudinal
slopes in the PLS model we were able to identify a group of non-decliners
that remained cognitively intact across the follow-up interval.
Conclusions: These results suggest that the inclusion of biomarker data
into models of cognitive and brain reserve may increase their predictive
power. Moreover, the further integration of longitudinal data results in
a strong resilience phenotype that can be leveraged in genomic and proteomic analyses to better understand the molecular basis of resilience.

B. YEW & D.A. NATION. Increased Cerebrovascular Resistance
is Associated with Greater Amyloid-β Deposition and Worse
Cognitive Performance in Preclinical and Clinical Alzheimer’s
Disease.
Objective: Elevated regional cerebrovascular resistance has been identified in Alzheimer’s disease and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) relative
to cognitively normal samples but how cerebrovascular stiffening relates
to amyloid-β remains to be explored.
Participants and Methods: Arterial spin labelling MRI was used to
measure cerebral blood flow (CBF) in regions typically affected by Alzheimer’s disease, for participants with Alzheimer’s dementia (n = 30),
MCI (n = 125), or healthy cognition (n = 73). Brachial artery blood
pressure values for both steady (mean arterial pressure) and pulsatile
(pulse pressure) components were then each divided by regional CBF
values to index estimates of regional cerebrovascular resistance. Regional amyloid-β deposition was also measured using PET imaging with

a florbetapir-fluorine-18 tracer. Cognitive ability was assessed globally
and across domains of memory and executive function.
Results: General linear models indicated that CBF was lower and cerebrovascular resistance indexes higher in Alzheimer’s relative to MCI and
cognitively normal groups. Cerebrovascular resistance indexes were also
higher in MCI compared to cognitively normal cases despite an absence
of significant CBF differences. Elevated cerebrovascular resistance in
the inferior temporal and parietal cortices was associated with increased
global and regional amyloid-β deposition, and worse cognitive performance. Strongest associations of cerebrovascular resistance indices with
both amyloid deposition and cognitive performance were observed in
preclinical stages of disease (i.e. amyloid positive without dementia).
Conclusions: Cerebrovascular resistance is associated with cerebral
amyloidosis and cognitive decline in preclinical and clinical Alzheimer’s
disease. Findings indicate that cerebrovascular stiffening may predate
changes in gross CBF since increases in cerebrovascular resistance were
evident prior (i.e. in preclinical groups) to differences in CBF observed
in those with dementia.

moderate-intensity physical activity are associated with CSF
biomarkers of Alzheimer’s disease: Findings from the Wisconsin
Registry for Alzheimer’s Prevention.
Objective: Amyloid (Aβ) plaques and neurofibrillary tangles are hallmark features of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Emerging evidence suggests
that physical activity (PA) might alter these pathological changes that
occur in AD. Accordingly, we sought to examine the relationship between objectively-measured PA and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of
Aβ42 and tau in asymptomatic late-middle-aged adults at risk for AD.
Participants and Methods: Seventy-two cognitively healthy late-middle-aged adults (age=64.03 years, 68.1% female) from the Wisconsin
Registry for Alzheimer’s Prevention participated in this study. They
wore an accelerometer (ActiGraph GT3X+) for one week to record
free-living PA. Accelerometer data yielded measures of sedentariness
and various intensities of PA. Participants also underwent lumbar
puncture for collection of CSF, from which Aβ42, total tau (t-tau) and
phosphorylated tau (p-tau) were immunoassayed. We additionally computed tau-to-Aβ42 ratios. Regression analyses were utilized to examine
the association between sedentariness/PA and CSF biomarkers, while
adjusting for confounds.
Results: Sedentariness was significantly associated with reduced Aβ42
(p=.006) and increased p-tau/Aβ42 (p=.040). Furthermore, engagement in moderate-intensity PA was significantly associated with higher
Aβ42 (p=.002), lower t-tau/Aβ42 (p=.006), and lower p-tau/Aβ42
(p=.027). In contrast, neither light- nor vigorous-intensity PA was significantly associated with Aβ or tau levels. The relationship between
moderate-intensity PA and CSF biomarkers persisted (p=.009 for Aβ42
and p=.028 for t-tau/Aβ42) even after accounting for time spent in
light- and vigorous-intensity PA categories.
Conclusions: In a late-middle-aged cohort, sedentary time was associated with more pathophysiology consistent with AD, whereas engagement in moderate-intensity PA was associated with less such pathophysiology. These data add to a growing body of evidence that a physically
active lifestyle may play a role in protecting against AD.

Cognitive Decline in the Wisconsin Registry for Alzheimer’s
Prevention.
Objective: The brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) Val66Met
polymorphism – a Valine (Val) to Methionine (Met) substitution at codon 66 – has been implicated in Alzheimer’s disease (AD), but its role in
preclinical AD is not fully characterized. The objective of this study was
to examine the influence of this polymorphism on longitudinal cognitive
trajectories in a large cognitively healthy cohort enriched for AD risk.
Participants and Methods: 1,023 middle-aged adults (baseline
age=54.94±6.41 years; 69.7% female) enrolled in the Wisconsin Registry for Alzheimer’s Prevention underwent BDNF genotyping and extensive cognitive assessment at up to five time points, with four years
between the first two time points and two years between all subsequent
time points. Four cognitive factors, including Verbal Learning & Memory, Speed & Flexibility, Working Memory, and Immediate Memory,
were examined. Random coefficient regression was used to elucidate the
effect of the BDNF Val66Met polymorphism on cognitive trajectories
while adjusting for relevant covariates.
Results: 32.3% of the sample was Met carriers. Val/Val and Met carriers did not differ in age, sex, education, parental family history of AD,
or apolipoprotein ε4 status. Compared to BDNF Val/Val carriers, Met
carriers showed steeper decline in cognitive domains of Verbal Learning
& Memory (p=.002) and Speed & Flexibility (p=.017). Analysis of the
component tests of these cognitive domains revealed that Met Carriers
had greater cognitive decline in Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test
(RAVLT) Long Delay (p=.007) and Recognition (p=.016), with trends
in RAVLT Total Learning (p=.061) and Trails B (p=.056).
Conclusions: In a large middle-aged cohort enriched for AD risk, carriage of the BDNF Met allele was associated with steeper decline in
episodic memory and executive function. These findings suggest that the
BDNF Val66Met polymorphism may play an important role in AD-related cognitive decline and could be considered as a target for novel
AD therapeutics.

J.C. PIERCY, A. HEITZER, B. PETERS & S. RAZ. Multiple
Gestation and Neuropsychological Performance in Preschoolers
Born Preterm.
Objective: Multiples are thought to be at increased risk for developmental outcome deficits in the preschool years, following preterm birth.
Little research has been conducted to determine whether this group
remains at higher risk in the age of assisted reproductive techniques
and surfactant therapy. We therefore wished to determine whether
multiplicity is a risk factor for neuropsychological outcome deficits in
preterm-born preschoolers recruited from a 2007-2011 birth cohort.
Participants and Methods: We compared 49 multiples (46 twins 3
triplets) and 75 singletons born preterm (< 34 weeks) and without
disabilities. The WPPSI-III, the NEPSY-2, and the PDMS-2 were used
to measure cognitive, language, and motor skills, respectively, between
3–4 years of age.
Results: Simultaneous multiple regression analyses revealed that multiplicity explained a significant portion of the variance in the PDMS-2

157
Total Motor (F(1, 101) = 4.39, p = .039) and Fine Motor (F(1, 105) =
5.94, p = .017) quotients as well as NEPSY-2 Word Generation (F(1,95)
= 11.70, p = .001) and Oromotor Sequences (F(1, 92) = 7.34, p = .008)
subtest scores, over and above the variance explained by birth weight,
SES, intrauterine growth, medical complications, age at testing, and
sex. The direction of the effect was opposite to our prediction, with
multiples demonstrating superior performance. Significant multiplicity
by sex interactions were found for NEPSY-2 Oromotor Sequences scores
(F(1, 90) = 4.15, p = .045) and PDMS-2 Total Motor Quotient (F(1,
97) = 5.01, p = .027), revealing a female twin advantage over male twin
and singleton performance.
Conclusions: In this investigation of preterm preschoolers born in the
surfactant era we found that multiplicity was not associated with a
poorer neurodevelopmental prognosis compared to singleton birth. The
absence of expected group differences is probably attributable to the
more benign causes of prematurity in multiples receiving modern neonatal intensive care, compared to their singleton counterparts.

5 weeks of gestation are crucial for fetal brain maturation. Early-term
(ET) birth (i.e. 37 to 38 GA weeks) has been recently linked with lower
cognitive outcomes in the general population. Our study aims at investigating, for the first time in adolescents with critical CHD, the long-term
impact of ET birth on neuropsychological and psychiatric outcomes.
More specifically, we sought to compare outcomes between patients
born ET to those born full-term (FT) (≥39 GA weeks).
Participants and Methods: This is a single-center study of neurodevelopmental and brain MRI outcomes in adolescents after open-heart
surgery. 133 patients with critical CHD participated in this study (n=33
ET and n=100 FT). All adolescents underwent a complete neuropsychological and psychiatric evaluation (e.g. IQ, BRIEF, D-KFES, Autism
Spectrum Quotient [ASQ], Conners’ ADHD/DSM-IV scale). Regression
analyses with adjustments for genetic status and SES were conducted
to identify GA group differences in outcomes.
Results: Patients born ET were comparable to those born FT on most
demographic and medical characteristics. Both groups did not differ in
terms of IQ (91.5 ± 14.1 and 92.8 ± 17.1 for the ET and FT groups
respectively). However, the proportion diagnosed with ADHD was
higher in the ET group (79% versus 66% in the FT group) (p=0.04).
Adolescents born ET and their parents reported more executive function
problems (p=0.04 BRIEF-self report and p=0.004 BRIEF Parent report)
and more attention issues (p<0.01). ET birth was also associated with
higher levels of anxiety, stress and more severe psychiatric symptoms
(all p<0.01).
Conclusions: Birth before 39 GA’s weeks has an adverse impact on
long-term outcomes in CHD. Higher-order functions such as executive
functions are predominantly affected by ET birth. This study challenges
the common assumption that birth at any time during the term gestation
is equally safe.

S.E. SCRATCH, A.C. BURNETT, K. TREYVAUD, A. URE,
L.W. DOYLE & P.J. ANDERSON. Toddler Behavior is Associated
with School-age Cognitive Performance in Children Born Very
Preterm.
Objective: This study aimed to assess the relationship between observed
toddler behavior and cognitive functioning at school-age.
Participants and Methods: 169 very preterm (VP; <30 weeks’ gestation or <1250 g birthweight) and 55 term children completed a parent-toddler problem-solving task at age 2, which assessed six domains
of toddler behavior (persistence, positive affect, negative affect, activity
level, dependence, and quality of transitions), and had a neuropsychological assessment at age 7. Variables were standardized against the
control group mean. Regression models were used to examine these
relationships, controlling for social risk.
Results: Persistence at age 2, which measured the extent to which the
toddler was problem-oriented and motivated to complete the presented
task, emerged as a strong predictor of cognitive performance at age 7.
However, these relationships differed across birth groups. In the VP
group, more persistent task behavior during toddlerhood predicted
stronger cognitive performance at school-age across multiple domains,
including IQ (β=0.29, p<0.001), language (β=0.35, p<0.001), attention
and executive functioning (β=0.47, p<0.001), and academic achievement (e.g. maths, β=0.29, p<0.001). In contrast, an inverse relationship
was found for term children, with greater task persistence at age 2
related to poorer school-age language (β=-0.26, p=0.007) and reading
performances (β=-0.22, p=0.047). The other five toddler behaviors were
not consistently associated with school-age cognitive outcomes in either
birth group.
Conclusions: Task persistence at age 2 was strongly associated with
better cognitive performance at age 7 in VP children. These findings
have implications for the development of early screening tools and identification of VP toddlers who may be at risk of school-age cognitive
vulnerabilities and academic underachievement.

R. WASSERMAN & G.N. HOLMBECK. Profiles of
Neuropsychological Functioning in Children and Adolescents
with Spina Bifida: Associations with Biopsychosocial Predictors
and Functional Outcomes.
Objective: The current study examined neuropsychological performance among children with spina bifida (SB) to determine biological
and functional associations with distinct subgroups or “profiles” of
cognitive functioning.
Participants and Methods: 96 children with SB myelomeningocele
(ages 8-15) completed a brief assessment battery, including measures of
IQ, academic achievement, executive functioning, attention, fine motor
speed, social emotional processing, and contextual language. Hierarchical and non-hierarchical cluster analyses were used to identify and confirm a cluster solution. Hypothesized predictors of cluster membership
included lesion level, number of shunt surgeries, history of seizures, age,
ethnicity, socio-economic status, family stress, and family environment.
Outcomes included independence, academic success, expectations for
the future, and quality of life.
Results: Ward’s cluster method indicated a 3-cluster solution, and
was replicated with 2 other cluster methods. The following labels were
applied to the clusters: “Average Cognitive Ability, Impaired Motor”
(n=39), “Average Cognitive Ability” (n=32), and “Extremely Low to
Borderline” (n=25). SES and shunt status significantly predicted group
membership. Cluster membership significantly predicted independence,
academic success, parent expectations for the future, and child reported
physical quality of life.
Conclusions: Cluster analyses identified 3 distinct cognitive profiles
with different patterns of cognitive strengths and weaknesses. Few

predictors (SES and shunt status) were associated with cluster membership. Yet, these clusters proved to distinguish the groups on daily
functioning outcomes and quality of life (as reported by children and
their parents). Findings from this study highlight the variability in cognitive profiles among children with SB, and the relevance of neuropsychological functioning to day-to-day adaptive functioning and quality
of life. Clinical implications and future research are discussed.

M.E. FOX & T.Z. KING. Pituitary Disorders as a Predictor of
Apathy and Executive Dysfunction in Adult Survivors of Childhood
Brain Tumors.
Objective: Both behavioral and endocrine changes are frequently observed following the presence and subsequent removal of a brain tumor.
Clinically significant apathy, a notable detriment to one’s quality of life,
emerges as one common outcome, and while apathy’s association with
endocrine dysfunction has been established in some populations, it has
not yet been investigated in brain tumor survivors. The present study
aims to evaluate the relationship between pituitary disorders and apathy, executive dysfunction, and disinhibition as measured by informant
report on the Frontal Systems Behavior Scale (FrSBe).
Participants and Methods: Seventy-six survivors of childhood brain
tumors at least five years past diagnosis were, on average, 23 years
old (SD=4) at the time of participation. An informant completed the
FrSBe, and information on hormone deficiencies was confirmed through
medical chart review.
Results: The presence of a pituitary disorder significantly predicted
total score on the FrSBe, R2=.05, p<.05. Among the subscales, presence of a pituitary disorder explained 9% of the variance in apathy
scores, R2=.09, p<.01, and a chi-square test confirmed that presence
of a pituitary disorder had a significant effect on whether an individual
presented with clinical levels of apathy χ2(5.51, N=76), p<.05. Presence
of a pituitary disorder accounted for 5% of the variance in executive
dysfunction, R2=.05, p<.05 but did not affect whether a participant
reached clinical levels of dysfunction. Presence of a pituitary disorder
was not significantly related to disinhibition.
Conclusions: Apathy and executive dysfunction in survivors of childhood brain tumors were strongly predicted by the presence of a pituitary
disorder, and individuals with a pituitary disorder were more likely to
present with clinical levels of apathy. Future studies should investigate
endocrine and executive dysfunctions and how they may relate to treatment and long-term adaptive outcomes.

Structure and Neuropsychological Function in Pediatric Crohn’s
Disease.
Objective: Structural brain changes in gray and white matter have
been found in adults with Crohn’s disease (CD). Potential underlying
mechanisms include intestinal and systemic inflammation as well as
anti-inflammatory therapy. To date little is known for pediatric CD.
We previously demonstrated decreased white matter density, cortical
thickness and subcortical volume in a small sample of children with CD
compared to healthy controls with effects of inflammation and steroids
(Mrakotsky et al., 2012, 2013, 2015). We found inflammation associated with poorer memory and mood. We here aim to replicate earlier
findings in a larger independent CD sample.
Participants and Methods: Thirty-five children 10-14 years (25 CD,
10 healthy controls) underwent structural MRI, DTI, neuropsychological assessment, and phlebotomy for inflammatory markers. Patients

Forty Fourth Annual INS Meeting Abstracts
were scanned and tested during active disease or in remission. Cortical
thickness and volume was measured with Freesurfer, fractional anisotropy with TBSS. Analyses were adjusted for intracranial volume, and
included correlation, regression and group comparisons. Groups were
comparable on demographics.
Results: Compared to controls, CD patients had widespread reduced
cortical thickness in posterior [bilateral inferior parietal, superior parietal, supramarginal (<.001-.01)] and middle frontal regions (<.05),
reduced subcortical volume [bilateral putamen, hippocampi, right
thalamus (<.01-.05)], altered FA in limbic tracts [cingulate, uncinate
(<.05)], and poorer verbal memory and cognition. Inflammation during
active disease was associated with cortical thinning (<.001-.05), lower
FA, (<.05), and poorer memory and cognition (<.05-.01). Direct relationship between brain structure and function was less clear.
Conclusions: Results confirm our prior findings of gray and white
matter involvement in pediatric CD, with effects of inflammation and
treatment. Current studies of the immune response aim to elucidate
underlying molecular mechanisms with the goal to inform medical
therapies.

Longitudinal Examination of Fine Motor Skills in Children with
Neurofibromatosis type 1.
Objective: Preschool-aged and school-aged children with NF1 have
been shown to have significant difficulties with fine motor (FM) skills.
No study has systematically examined early FM skills over time in young
children with NF1. The aim of this longitudinal study is to better characterize the developmental course of early FM functioning in young
children with NF1.
Participants and Methods: Participants were 25 children (17 boys)
with NF1 ages 3 through 8 who were assessed at three, consecutive time
points (T1, T2, T3) across a 5-year-span. General intellectual ability,
nonverbal reasoning abilities, and fine motor functioning were examined using select subtests from the Differential Ability Scales – Second
Edition and NEPSY-II.
Results: Children with NF1 scored significantly lower than the normative mean on all FM tasks across all three time points (Copying T1,
T2, T3: p > .001; IHP T1, T2: p > .001; Imitating Hand Positions T3:
p = .013; Visual Motor Precision T1: p = .002; VMP T2, T3: p > .001).
No significant effects of time on Copying (Wilks’ Lambda = .97, F(2,
23) = 0.97, p = .673, multivariate partial eta squared = .04), nor VMP
(Wilks’ Lambda = .87, F(2, 16) = 1.23, p = .317, multivariate partial
eta squared = .13) were found. There was a significant effect for time
on IHP (Wilks’ Lambda = .68, F(2, 23) = 5.42, p = .012, multivariate
partial eta squared = .32), with improvements seen between T1 to T3
and T2 to T3.
Conclusions: For children with NF1, FM functioning is falling significantly below the level that would be expected for their age and,
generally, does not improve over time. While results indicate that there
was improvement in IHP performance over time, scores continued to
remain significantly below the normative mean across all three time
points. These findings suggest that FM functioning consistently remains
an area of significant difficulty for young children with NF1 and highlights the importance of early assessment and continued monitoring of
FM functioning for children with NF1.

Symposium 8. Deployment Trauma:
Insights from the TRACTS Cohort on the Clinical,

G.L. IVERSON & B.B. TROTTER. Deployment Trauma: Insights
from the TRACTS Cohort on the Clinical, Cognitive, and
Neuoranatomical Effects of Mild TBI and its Comorbidities in OEF/
OIF/OND Veterans.
Symposium Description: Mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) is the
most common physical injury among Veterans of Operation Enduring
Freedom/Operation Iraqi Freedom/Operation New Dawn (OEF/OIF/
OND). However, mTBI is frequently accompanied by multiple physical and psychiatric comorbidities. The Translational Research Center
for TBI and Stress Disorders (TRACTS) TBI Center of Excellence has
developed a multidisciplinary approach to the assessment of mTBI and
its comorbidities that will improve our understanding of the complex
pathophysiology associated with co-occurring mTBI and related stress
disorders. Dr. Amick will describe the TRACTS clinical dataset and how
it has been used to empirically derive functionally significant clinical
phenotypes. The prevalence and functional disability of the Deployment
Trauma Phenotype (DTP; presence of comorbid mTBI, PTSD, and Depression), previously linked to severe disability in the TRACTS sample,
will then be discussed using a novel epidemiological sample. Highlighting the cognitive consequences of deployment related mTBI, Dr. Poole
will describe the unique effect of mTBI upon sustained attention independent of PTSD symptoms. Extending these findings, Dr. Fortier
will discuss two new empirically derived phenotypes (mTBI phenotype:
mTBI, Pain, Sleep; PTSD phenotype: PTSD, Depression) and their effects on cognitive functioning using standardized neuropsychological
measures. Mr. Trotter will present neuroanatomical correlates of blast
exposure and PTSD, including brain-aging trajectories. Finally, Dr.
Kenna will present a novel integrated intervention focused on cognitive
skill building to treat the range of deployment-related psychological
and behavioral conditions that is being empirically evaluated in the
TRACTS sample. Our increased understanding of the systemic multiple
interacting problems common among OEF/OIF/OND Veterans will help
to create effective, targeted rehabilitation and treatment approaches and
inform the future of our military.

M. AMICK, M. METERKO, C.B. FORTIER, W.P. MILBERG &
R. MCGLINCHEY. The Deployment Trauma Phenotype and
Employment Status in OEF/OIF/OND Veterans.
The presence of comorbid mild traumatic brain injury (TBI), post
traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and depression (deployment trauma
phenotype, DTP) has been linked to difficulty with reintegration and
disability among individuals deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan. In this
study we used an epidemiological sample (n=86,140) of veterans to
examine the prevalence and clinical characteristics of DTP and its associated functional disability. Methods: A database review of the comprehensive TBI Examination(CTBIE) employed by all VA hospitals was
conducted. The CTBIE is a standardized measure for assessing and
characterizing TBI experiences, psychological disorders, and neurobehavioral symptoms. The frequency of mild TBI, PTSD, and Depression
in isolation, pairs, and as a triad and their association with employment
status was examined. A measure of symptom validity was used to exclude participants with questionable response validity (7,194 excluded).

160
Results: DTP was observed in 17.9% of the final sample (n=48,821).
Both DTP and co-occurring PTSD and Depression were associated with
the highest levels of unemployment (19.9% both). Unemployment did
not greatly differ between individual diagnoses of mTBI (8.6%), PTSD
(14.7%) or Depression (15.5%) compared to individuals with none of
these diagnoses (13.8%). Examination of age indicated that DTP was
associated with a greater percentage of Veterans out of the work force
across all age ranges, except for the oldest Veteran’s with PTSD and
Depression (33.6% unemployed). Discussion: Our previous finding of
the negative functional consequences of comorbid mild TBI, PTSD and
Depression are validated in a large epidemiological sample of Veterans.
It is of grave concern that almost 20% of veterans with DTP have left
the workforce; underscoring the need for multi-faceted psychological,
behavioral, and vocational interventions to improve reintegration post
deployment.

V. POOLE, F. FORTENBAUGH, W.P. MILBERG, R. MCGLINCHEY,
J. DEGUTIS & M. ESTERMAN. Chronic Military-related Mild
Traumatic Brain Injury is Associated with Decreased Sustained
Attention Ability, Not Decreased Global Neuropsychological
Functioning.
Mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) is of growing national concern for
OEF/OIF Veterans. However, it remains unclear how (and if), monthsto-years post-injury, mTBI affects cognitive performance and functioning beyond other common co-morbidities (e.g., post-traumatic stress
disorder, PTSD). Considering that sustained attention has been identified as a potentially vulnerable cognitive domain, we assessed those
with and without mTBI on a sensitive measure of sustained attention
and compared these results to standard neuropsychological measures
of attention, executive function, and memory. We enrolled 118 Veterans (M=32.3 yrs): 23 with deployment-related mTBI only, 19 with
PTSD only, 50 with mTBI and PTSD, and 26 with neither condition.
Participants performed neuropsychological tests and the gradual-onset
continuous performance task (gradCPT), a go/no-go sustained attention task where participants respond to non-targets (90%) and withhold to rare targets (10%). The task eliminates the exogenous effects
of abrupt stimulus onsets and is more reliant on intrinsic sustained
attention abilities than traditional CPTs. Reaction time, commission/
omission errors, and d-prime were among the performance measures
assessed. When compared to those without an mTBI, Veterans with a
deployment-related mTBI had significantly lower d’ (poorer sustained
attention ability), driven by higher omission errors (failures to press to
non-targets). These effects were significant after controlling for PTSD
(Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale score). In contrast, no effects of
mTBI were found on standard neuropsychological measures of attention,
executive function, or memory. These findings suggest deployment-related mTBI is associated with difficulties in sustaining attention beyond
PTSD and that these deficits may not be detected by standard neuropsychological assessments.

& R. MCGLINCHEY. Deployment Trauma: Clinical Phenotypes
and their Impact on Cognition in OEF/OIF/OND Veterans.
Objective: OEF/OIF/OND Veterans are returning from deployment with
multiple interacting physical and mental health conditions. We have
demonstrated that depression, PTSD, and military mTBI statistically
cluster together, and that this Deployment Trauma Phenotype was associated with high risk for substantial disability (Lippa, 2015). We extend
these findings in our larger dataset to define two new empirically derived
phenotypes that have distinct cognitive signatures.
Methods and Participants: Data from the VA RR&D TRACTS was analyzed to investigate the effects of deployment-related psychiatric and

behavioral conditions on neuropsychological test performance in 450
OEF/OIF/OND Veterans. Structured clinical interviews assessed TBI
and psychiatric conditions; self-report questionnaires assessed disability
and behavioral conditions (sleep disturbance, pain).
Results: Over 90% of Veterans had a psychiatric and/or behavioral
condition; over half presented with ≥3 conditions. Exploratory factor
analysis revealed four clinically relevant psychiatric and behavioral phenotypes (variance explained=72.3%): (1) military mTBI, pain, and sleep
(mTBI factor); (2) PTSD and depression (PTSD factor); (3) anxiety
disorders, other than PTSD (anxiety factor); (4) substance abuse or
dependence (substance use factor). Veterans with conditions comprising
both the mTBI and PTSD phenotypes showed slowed response times
and made more errors on tasks of executive function. Veterans with only
the mTBI phenotype showed deficits in verbal memory (immediate and
delayed recall and recognition memory).
Conclusions: The combined diagnoses of military mTBI, current pain,
and current sleep disturbance may comprise a harmful clinical phenotype associated with cognitive impairment, including slowing and
verbal memory deficits. The phenotype of mTBI combined with PTSD
may result in additional frontal dysfunction relative to either phenotype
in isolation.

W.P. MILBERG, R. MCGLINCHEY & D.H. SALAT. Neuroanatomical
correlates of blast exposure and PTSD, including brain aging
trajectories.
Objective: Blast exposure (BE) and post-traumatic stress disorder
(PTSD) are common in Veterans and have been linked to altered brain
structure. It is unknown how different aspects of deployment trauma
may alter neuronal integrity across the lifespan. This study examined
how PTSD and BE may respectively moderate associations between the
T1/T2 ratio in the cortical ribbon (imaging marker of myelination) and
diffusion measures of white matter (WM) integrity and age.
Participants and Methods: Studies of PTSD (217/67 +/-) and BE
(190/59 +/-) examined how these features of deployment trauma might
exacerbate the effect of age on neural structure. T1/T2 values taken
from 35% projection fraction from the gray/white to pial surface and
diffusion measures (e.g. fractional anisotropy) were used as estimates
of cortical myelination and white matter integrity, respectively. Formal
interaction between PTSD status and the regression coefficient for T1/
T2 with age was tested, as well as a similar interaction between BE and
age on white matter integrity.
Results: Analyses revealed a significant and widespread positive association between T1/T2 ratio and age, and follow-up analyses revealed
that a negative association between age and T2 drove this effect. PTSD
moderated the effect of age on T1/T2 ratio in the left inferior temporal
lobe, with the PTSD+ group showing a stronger age effect. BE moderated the cross-sectional relationship between age and white matter
integrity, with BE+ linked to a more rapid trajectory towards reduced
white matter integrity.
Conclusions: T1/T2 ratio and diffusion measure age associations could
help reveal how patterns in cytoarchitecture are differentially impacted
by age, PTSD and BE. The current work is limited due to the cross-sectional nature. Examining the longitudinal trajectories of the interactive
effect of age and PTSD/BE will provide important follow-up to these
results.

Feasibility and Acceptability of STEP-Home: A Rehabilitation
Workshop to Facilitate Civilian Reintegration Among OEF/OIF/
OND Veterans.
Objective: Veterans from Operation Enduring Freedom, Operation Iraqi
Freedom, and Operation New Dawn (OEF/OIF/OND) are a clinically
complex group with multiple comorbidities who often do not engage
with typical VA standard of care models. These Veterans require integrative interventions tailored to their unique needs that are palatable,
engaging, and destigmatizing.
Participants/Methods: The 12-session STEP-Home workshop uses key
ingredients from the evidence-based civilian TBI rehabilitation program,
“STEP” (Short-Term Executive Plus; Cantor et al., 2014), while adding
content tailored directly to military-to-civilian challenges. Workshop
modules included problem solving, emotional regulation, self-awareness, planning, attention training, community reintegration, vocational
rehabilitation, Veteran-to-Veteran support/mentorship, family involvement, and psychoeducation. Six groups (n=47) of OEF/OIF/OND Veterans participated in the study. Evaluation of program feasibility was
assessed by interest to enroll, actual enrollment, and interest in workshop goals. Program acceptability was measured by session adherence,
attrition, and Veteran satisfaction ratings.
Results: A treatment manual and training program were developed and
refined. Therapist adherence to content was high across six groups.
Willingness to enroll (87%), actual enrollment (62%), and adherence
across group sessions (63%) were high, while attrition was low (6.4%).
Interest in workshop goals showed a 19.6% increase post-intervention
and Veteran satisfaction ratings were consistently high. Veterans expressed desire for STEP-Home to continue and an increase in their
openness to other VA services.
Conclusions: STEP-Home offers a much needed, palatable, and less
stigmatizing intervention for returning Veterans struggling with reintegration difficulties that is both feasible and acceptable.

Plenary E. The Statistical Crisis in Science
Presenter: Andrew Gelman

11:00 a.m.–12:00 p.m.
A. GELMAN. The Statistical Crisis in Science.
Top journals in applied science routinely publish ridiculous, scientifically implausible claims, justified based on “p < 0.05.” And this in
turn calls into question all sorts of more plausible, but not necessarily
true, claims, that are supported by this same sort of evidence. To put
it another way: we can all laugh at studies of ESP, or ovulation and
voting, but what about MRI studies of political attitudes, or embodied
cognition, or stereotype threat, or, for that matter, the latest potential
cancer cure? If we can’t trust p-values, does experimental science involving human variation just have to start over? Can Bayesian inference
supply a solution? Maybe. These are not easy problems, but they’re
important problems.
Learning Objectives
As a result of attending this presentation, the learner will achieve the
following objectives:
Have a deeper understanding of the ways in which classical statistical
methods can yield overconfident, biased claims, and
Become aware of new statistical techniques for recognizing and reducing
these biases.

K. ALLEN, T. BURDA, B. OTT & M.G. O’CONNOR. Distractibility,
Aging, and Driving: Relationship of Scores on the Useful Field of
View Across Mini Mental State Exam, Age, Diagnosis and Drivewise
Assessment Outcome Scores.
Objective: The purpose of this study was to understand how age and
diagnosis of PD, AD, and MCI impacts visual distractibility on the Useful
Field of View test. Further, the researcher was seeking to understand
how distractibility impacts driving risk as determined by the Drivewise
assessment.
Participants and Methods: An archival, correlational design was used
to examine the impact of age on UFOV performance and the impact of
age, diagnosis and UFOV performance on driving. Data was gathered
from the records of the neurobehavioral unit of a teaching hospital in
a large northeastern US city.Of a larger research database, 236 participants were entered into the study due to the availability of UFOV test
scores. Statistical analyses were conducted to investigate the relationship
between age, MMSE, and diagnosis across performances on UFOV 1,
UFOV 2, and distractibility (UFOV 2 – UFOV 1).

Results: The results indicated that age had a slight positive correlation
with UFOV 2 and distractibility. Participants with impaired mental
status were significantly more likely to perform in the “slow” category
on UFOV 2 and the high distractibility category than normal MMSE
participants. There were significant diagnostic group differences for
UFOV 2 and distractibility. The results also revealed that low distractibility participants were significantly more likely to pass the driving
evaluation than high distractibility participants.
Conclusions: The findings of this study suggest that a single measure
to determine driving risk is insufficient. These results are also consistent
with Ball & Owsley’s (2003) report that age is not a reliable predictor
of driving risk, as many older adults are able to continue driving safely.
Recommendations for future research include larger diagnostic groups,
alternate or revised measures of distractibility as well as including measures of symptom severity.

S. ALLISON & D. HEAD. Route Repetition and Reversal in Older
Adults.
Objective: Prior studies indicate age differences in learning routes from
a start location to a target destination. There is less research on age effects on reversing a learned path. The method used to learn routes may
also impact navigation. This study examined how encoding methods
influence the ability of older adults to recreate routes in forward and
reverse directions.

162
Participants and Methods: Young (n=50) and older (n=50) adults
were randomly assigned to learn a route in a virtual reality environment
by either self-navigation or map study. Participants first completed
multiple study-test trials to learn a route in the forward direction. Participants then recreated the route in the reverse direction. After 15 minutes, participants recreated the route in forward and reverse directions.
ANOVAs were conducted in SPSS to examine performance.
Results: Older adults in the map study condition took significantly
more trials to learn the route in the forward direction (p<.01). Across
encoding methods, older adults made more errors than young adults
in recreating the route in reverse after initial forward learning (p<.01).
Older adults also made more errors than young adults for both forward
and reverse directions after a delay (p<.01). Finally, older adults had
greater difficulty recreating the route in the reverse direction compared
to forward after a delay (p<.01). There was no significant effect of
encoding method for immediate reversal, delayed forward or delayed
reversal.
Conclusions: Results suggest that initially learning a route from a map
is more difficult for older adults, but then encoding method may not
modulate recreation of the route. Older adults also have difficulty not
only learning a route to a target destination, but also traversing back
to the start location. Older adults may have particular difficulty in retaining sufficient environmental information to reverse direction after
a delay. Future work could examine methods to improve both learning
routes from maps and route reversal abilities for older adults.

D. BARULLI, J. STEFFENER, P. LEMAIRE & Y. STERN. Cognitive
Strategies as a Possible Mechanism of Cognitive Reserve.
Objective: Using an arithmetical strategy section task we aimed to
determine if greater levels of cognitive reserve (CR) could be used to
predict better strategy selection, independently of related abilities such
as executive functions or domain-specific arithmetical ability. We also
aimed to see if strategy selection ability could function like CR in a
moderated-mediation model in which CR was previously demonstrated
to moderate the effect of age-related cortical thickness variation on fluid
reasoning ability.
Participants and Methods: 32 healthy young adults and 33 healthy
older adults participated. Each received a strategy selection task requiring them to estimate the product of 2 two-digit numbers using one
of two strategies: rounding both numbers down to the nearest decade,
or rounding both numbers up to the next highest decade. Participants
were also administered tests of their fluid reasoning ability, executive
functions, arithmetic ability, and several assessments serving as CR
proxies. Structural MRI scans were also given to derive cortical thickness
measures for each participant using FreeSurfer software.
Results: Results suggest that strategy selection is associated with CR
independently of executive functions and arithmetical ability. Furthermore, in at least one brain region strategy selection behaved like CR
proxies in moderating the effect of age-related differences in cortical
thickness on fluid reasoning performance.
Conclusions: Strategy selection is associated with CR independently
of executive functions and domain-specific expertise, and furthermore
it acts like CR in certain fundamental ways which suggest it might be a
potential mechanism of this important moderator. This has important
implications for potential interventions.

and cognitive training on executive functions and dual-task
performance in older adults.
Objective: Several studies have reported benefits of exercise interventions (see Bherer, Erickson & Liu-Ambrose, 2013 for a review) and cognitive training (see Belleville & Bherer, 2012 for a review) on cognitive
performance in older adults. This study assessed the effect of combining
both interventions in an older adult population.
Participants and Methods: In this study, 136 healthy older adults were
randomly assigned to one of the 4 combinations 1) aerobic training and
dual-task training; 2) aerobic training and placebo computer; 3) stretching training and dual-task training; 4) stretching training and placebo
computer. Pre and post-test assessment involved physical functioning,
neuropsychological tests and computerized dual-task.
Results: Results show improved performance neuropsychological test of
executive control (switching) after cognitive training, but no substantial
added benefits of the aerobic training. In the computerized dual-task,
results showed larger change in dual-mixed than in single-mixed trials, but only for the groups that completed the dual-task training (vs.
placebo computer), with no substantial difference between aerobic and
stretching exercise. Improvement in other task conditions was equivalent
among all groups.
Conclusions: Results of the present study further support the benefits
of dual-task training on executive functions and dual task performance,
and suggest equivalent effect of aerobic and stretching exercise on executive control and dual-task performance.

A.C. BIRDSILL, S. KAUR, C. CASSILL, P. PARKER, A. IRETON
& A. HALEY. Executive Function, Not Memory, Is Associated with
White Matter Structure in Middle Age.
Objective: Indices of white matter changes over the adult lifespan have
been associated with declines of memory and executive functioning.
Characterizing these associations at middle age is of particular importance, as middle age may be a crucial time when cognitive-aging trajectories may be modified. We hypothesized that fractional anisotrophy
(FA), a marker of white matter health, will display positive regional
associations with memory and executive functioning in healthy middle
age participants.
Participants and Methods: Healthy participants (N = 162) between
the ages of 40 and 62 (M = 49.5, SD = 6.4) underwent MRI scanning
with a Siemen’s Skyra 3T system and neuropsychological testing. Executive functioning was calculated from digit span, Stroop interference,
Trail Making Test A and Trail Making Test B. Memory was calculated
from CVLT short delay free recall, long delay free recall, and recognition
descriminability. Whole brain analysis was performed by full tensor registration in DTI-TK. Tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS), permutation
testing with Randomize, and Threshold-Free Cluster Enhancement were
used in FSL to identify statistically significant clusters.
Results: Controlling for age, education, and sex, executive function
was positively associated with FA throughout the white matter. Peak
voxels were located in the left and right inferior fronto-occipital fasciculi.
Memory was not associated with FA.
Conclusions: The results provide evidence that white matter differences are associated with differences in executive functioning, but not
memory, in middle age. These results are consistent with previous research indicating that executive function is particularly sensitive to white
matter damage. These results highlight the need to identify therapeutic
targets to maintain white matter health to prevent cognitive decline.

L. DELANO-WOOD, A.J. JAK & M.W. BONDI. Comparisons
of Traditional and Comprehensive Approaches in Defining
SuperAgers.
Objective: Prior research has investigated ‘SuperAgers’ defined as older
adults with superior recall on verbal list learning memory tests. We
sought to examine the longitudinal stability and outcomes of ‘SuperAging’ based on traditionally defined criteria reflected by an above average
performance on a single memory score versus a more comprehensive
approach across multiple memory tests.
Participants and Methods: 95 community-dwelling, non-demented/
non-MCI, older adults (age ≥ 70) received annual neuropsychological
assessment. Traditional SuperAgers (tSA) were defined as performing ≥
1.5 SD above norms on CVLT I/II long delay free recall (LDFR) alone.
Comprehensive SuperAgers (cSA) performed ≥ 1 SD above norms on
CVLT LDFR and WMS-R Logical Memory II (LM II). Both criteria also
required normative performance ≥ -1.0 SD on language and executive
functioning tests. SuperAging groups were subsequently compared to
typically-aging normal older adults who did not meet either SuperAging
criteria at baseline (n= 62).
Results: 22 individuals (23%) met criteria for tSA and 26 (27%) for
cSA. Neither group differed from typical-agers on demographic comparisons. At baseline cSA performed significantly better on Trails B,
category fluency, and the Boston Naming Task than typical-agers (p’s
≤ .04). Upon one year follow-up there was no difference (p=.29) in
percentage of tSA (50%) versus cSA (36%) who continued to meet
respective criteria; at two years, a similar pattern emerged (tSA 42%
vs. cSA 47%; p=.84).
Conclusions: There was no difference in longitudinal stability regarding decline to typical-aging between the traditional and comprehensive
approach. However, cSA tended to demonstrate better performance
than typical-agers in non-memory domains than tSA. Future research
should examine longitudinal stability of these criteria and generalizability of superior cognition to non-memory domains in conjunction with
neuroimaging techniques.

Discriminant Validity and Diagnostic Utility of the Test of Practical
Judgment (TOP-J).
Objective: The Test of Practical Judgment (TOP-J) is a neuropsychological measure which assesses an older individual’s ability to rationalize
and problem solve. Questions focus on safety, medical, social/ethical,
and financial issues. The purpose of this archival study was to examine this measure for the first time in a Veteran sample and develop a
cut score to differentiate between cognitively healthy versus impaired
adults.
Participants and Methods: Participants included 1 female and 42
males referred as outpatients for a comprehensive neuropsychological
evaluation at a large Veterans Affairs hospital. Participants were excluded if they failed Word Memory Test (n=7). All participants were
evaluated by a Board Certified Neuropsychologist and were categorized
as either cognitively intact, mild neurocognitive disorder, or major neurocognitive disorder (per DSM-V criteria). Descriptive statistics and
correlations were run in SPSS. .
Results: Major and mild neurocognitive disorder were grouped together
due to small sample sizes. No significant demographic differences were
observed between the cognitively intact and impaired groups. As hypothesized, convergent validity indicated the TOP-J was significantly

163
(p<.05) correlated with measures of language, lexical fluency, and list
learning and not correlated with measures of processing speed, visual
spatial processing, story memory, attention, and working memory. Surprisingly, the TOP-J was not strongly correlated with verbal abstraction
and semantic fluency. A cutoff score of <21 yielded SE=.75, SP=.58 for
predicting individuals with cognitive impairment.
Conclusions: The TOP-J demonstrated sound convergent and divergent
validity; however, its use for diagnostic classification was limited given
the small range of observed scores, which was also a noted limitation
in the original normative study. Limitations include: relatively small
sample size, mostly male sample, and selection bias on when to administer the TOP-J.

E. GRANDFIELD, D. IGNACIO, L. ISLAS, V. SANCHEZ &
B.J. CHERRY. Blood Pressure and Cognition.
Objective: Structural equation modeling (SEM) was used to model
latent variables of blood pressure (2008; 2014) and cognition (2014) to
determine whether blood pressure predicts specific cognitive domains.
Data from a longitudinal study investigating older adults (50 years
of age or older) with and without chronic pain were utilized. Levin et
al. (2014) recently used SEM to investigate metabolic syndrome and
its association with cognition and found that blood pressure but not
measures of obesity, lipid or blood glucose levels significantly predicted
cognitive domains (language, memory, executive function, motor processing speed).
Participants and Methods: Data from 50 participants were available
for diastolic and systolic blood pressure (2008; 2014) to create a latent
variable of blood pressure using SEM. Scores from cognitive measures
including a 10-item word list, Digit Span Forward/ Backward, Trail
Making Tests A/B, Stroop Color/Word Test, Digit Symbol Substitution,
Everyday Problems Test and Animal Fluency created latent variables
for episodic memory, executive function/processing speed and working
memory. Standardized regression coefficients were then used to regress
the cognitive domains on covariates (age, education, depression) and
blood pressure.
Results: The Blood Pressure factor showed strong model fit. Cognitive
indicators also demonstrated model fit, with first order factors exceeding
.4, and the second order cognitive factor defined by episodic memory,
executive function/processing speed and working memory. Using standardized regression coefficients, both adjusted and unadjusted models
demonstrated that blood pressure significantly predicted all three cognitive domains.
Conclusions: Blood pressure over six years was significantly associated
with episodic memory, executive function/processing speed and working
memory in 2014. These types of studies are important for better understanding underlying biological mechanisms related to cognitive aging.

S.J. CROWLEY & C. PRICE. Cerebral Oximetry and Leukoaraiosis
Contributions to Working Memory in Older Adults.
Objective: Regional cerebral oxygen saturation (rSO2) is reported to
be a) lower for those with impaired MMSE scores prior to hip fracture
surgery, and b) a potential risk factor for post-operative complications.
There is little to no research, however, examining the neuroimaging
risk factor for reduced oximetry or the specific cognitive domain implicated in low rSO2. From an ongoing federally funded investigation
studying neuroimaging predictors of post-operative cognitive decline, we
investigated the hypothesis that increasing amounts of cerebrovascular
disease as measured by white matter hyperintensities (leukoaraiosis;
LA) would significantly relate to lower bilateral rSO2. We secondarily

164
examined how patients’ presurgery LA and bilateral rSO2 predicted
working memory and declarative memory.
Participants and Methods: Participants included 39 older adults.
For aim 1, Pearson product moment assessed relationships between
MRI-LA controlling for total intracranial volume and bilateral cerebral
oximetry acquired during the day of surgery (48 hours after baseline
testing/MRI), but before anesthesia induction. For aim 2, bilateral rSO2
and LA were examined as contributors to presurgery working memory
(Digit Span Backward, Spatial Span Total, Letter Number Sequencing)
and declarative memory (HVLT-R Delay/Recognition; WMS-III Logical
Memory Delay) composites.
Results: Participants included 39 adults (17M:22F; age=69.2 ± 6.2
years). LA/TICV and cerebral oximetry did not associate (r(35)= -0.14,
p>.05). Linear regression analyses showed higher baseline oximetry
(β=0.39, p<.05) and lower LA/TICV (β=0-.29, p<.05) predicted better
working memory, with a trending relationship for declarative memory
(p=0.06).
Conclusions: Data demonstrate no association between LA and bilateral rSO2. However, both cerebral oximetry and LA load are considerations for pre-operative cognitive health, specifically working memory.

H. CHUNG & A. ZARTMAN. Assessing Medication Management
Abilities in Older Adults in an Inpatient Medical Rehabilitation
Setting.
Objective: Studies indicate older adults diagnosed with a neurocognitive disorder are at higher risk for medication mismanagement. In an
inpatient medical rehabilitation setting, this can have serious implications with discharge disposition. This study examined the differences 1)
between performance of a medication management task on perceived
medication management abilities, 2) between medication adherence
prior to inpatient rehabilitation admission and performance of medication management task, and 3) between patients who have a primary
diagnosis of cognitive versus psychiatric disorder and performance of a
medication management task.
Participants and Methods: Forty-five participants admitted to a
Veteran Affairs (VA) inpatient rehabilitation unit were administered a
medication management task, the Pillbox Test, and the Self-Efficacy for
Medication Management Scale to assess older adults’ perceived abilities
about medication management.
Results: An independent t-test found no significant difference between
perceived abilities to manage medications as both patients who passed
or failed the Pillbox Test rated their abilities as high. However, a Chisquare test of independence found a significant relationship between
patient’s diagnosis and Pillbox Test performance (X2 (2) = 8.71, p <
.05), as well as medication adherence and Pillbox Test performance
(X2 (1) = 9.35, p < .05).
Conclusions: Results suggest patients diagnosed with a neurocognitive
disorder were more likely to fail a medication management task than
patients with a psychiatric diagnosis or no diagnosis at all. Eighty-three
percent of nonadherent patients failed the Pillbox Test suggesting patients and caregivers may benefit from further intervention or treatment
to improve adherence. Finally, our study highlights a potential problem
with self-reported adherence as patients with limited self-awareness
overestimate their ability to manage medications.

J. COHEN, M. GONZALES, A. KARSTENS & M. LAMAR. The Oblique
Effect: Applying Ophthalmological and Neurophysiological
Principles of Visuospatial Processing to Cognitive Aging and
Vascular Health.
Objective: From early work in ophthalmology to later, international
work in neurophysiology, studies have examined the visuoperceptual
experience known as the oblique effect (OE). The OE denotes a performance advantage when processing visual stimuli oriented horizontally
or vertically and a performance disadvantage when processing diagonal,
i.e., oblique, stimuli; a disadvantage exacerbated by executive and/or
attentional dysfunction.
Participants and Methods: We explored the OE in 45 vasculopaths (23
males; ~age=65+5.5). Given that cardiovascular risk factors negatively
impact executive functioning (EF) and attention, we hypothesized that
poorer cognitive and/or vascular health would be negatively associated with the OE using the Judgment of Line Orientation (JOLO) Test.
Lines were considered oblique if they fell near the 45-degree angles of
the JOLO array (lines 3,4,8,&9) and non-oblique if out of this range,
horizontal, or vertical. The percentage of oblique line errors (%OErr)
was calculated as: (#OErr/#oblique lines)*100; the percentage of nonoblique line errors (%non-OErr) was similarly calculated.
Results: Vasculopaths produced a higher %OErr (31.94+17.64) than
%non-OErr (7.59+6.74; t(43)=10.67, p>.001). After controlling for
age, %OErr was negatively associated with EF [r(36)=-.646, p<.001]
and attention [r(36)=-.446, p=.005], and positively associated with
hemoglobin A1c levels [r(39)=.314, p=.04]. Only the correlation between %OErr and EF remained after controlling for age, education,
and MMSE.
Conclusions: Poorer cognition and vascular health negatively associated with participants’ ability to distinguish oblique lines. We are
currently examining the OE in younger and older non-vasculopaths and
dementia patients compared to our current sample, and determining the
neuroanatomical associates of the OE for a more comprehensive model
of this visuoperceptual experience.

C.N. HARTLEY, K. SCROGGINS & P. GILBERT. Does Less
Efficient Pattern Separation Contribute to Age-Related Deficits
in Spatial Memory?
Objective: Spatial memory is known to decline with advancing age,
which may have implications for everyday functioning in older adults.
Spatial memory may be particularly impaired in older adults when interference is high, possibly due to age-related changes in pattern separation. We used signal detection theory (SDT) to evaluate spatial memory
utilizing a new test hypothesized to tax pattern separation. Correlations
with standardized neuropsychological tests also were examined.
Participants and Methods: Healthy young (n=40) and older (n=30)
adults completed a new spatial recognition memory test involving trials
with high or low levels of spatial interference. On each trial, participants
remembered the location of a circle that appeared on a computer screen.
Then, a circle appeared either in the same location or a different location
that was separated from the original location by 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, or 2.0
cm. Participants indicated whether the circle was in the “same” or a
“different” location. Smaller spatial separations (0.5 and 1.0 cm) on
“different” trials were hypothesized to result in greater interference than
larger separations (1.5 and 2.0 cm), and hence place greater demands
on pattern separation.
Results: A mixed model ANOVA with d’ as the dependent variable
revealed that older adults were significantly impaired relative to young
adults on the high and low interference conditions (ps < .05). Both
groups performed significantly better in the low interference condition
compared to the high interference condition (ps < .05), with young
adults exhibiting greater improvement relative to older adults (47%
larger effect size). Performance was found to correlate significantly with

Forty Fourth Annual INS Meeting Abstracts
standardized measures of delayed memory (ps < .05), but not language,
working memory, or fluency.
Conclusions: Using a new test and SDT, we found that age-related
differences in spatial memory may depend on the level of interference.
Correlational analyses with standardized neuropsychological tests revealed preliminary evidence for construct validity.

K. DENNY, C. BARBA & S. TOMASZEWSKI FARIAS. Assessment of
a Multi-Modal Intervention to Enhance Cognitive Compensation
Strategies and Promote Brain Health Activities.
Objective: The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of a
multi-modal intervention to enhance cognitive compensation strategies
and promote brain health activities in older adults.
Participants and Methods: Older adults (n=9) living independently
within the community completed an eight-week program which targeted
two areas of intervention aimed at: 1) enhancing cognitive compensation
strategies and 2) promoting brain health activities. The three cognitive
compensation strategies were designed to promote habitual use of a calendar, use of ‘To Do’ lists for achievement of short- and long-term goals,
and the development of functional organizational systems at home. The
three brain health modules included physical exercise, engagement in
cognitive stimulating activities, and enhancing positive outlook in part
through practicing gratitude and mindfulness meditation.
Participants completed questionnaires on the first and last day of the
course to assess to what extent they engaged in the specific compensatory
skills emphasized in the program and the frequency with which they
participated in the brain health activities.
Results: Results showed significant increases in the use of compensation
strategies (p = 0.015) and increased brain health activity engagement
(p = 0.04) following completion of this course
Conclusions: This study adds to the growing literature on the use of
multi-modal interventions for older adults to promote cognitive and
functional health. Novel aspects of the current program include the emphasis on enhancing compensations strategies to maintain independence
in everyday functioning and the integration of compensation strategies
to promote healthy lifestyles. Greater improvement was observed in
the use of compensation strategies as compared to the brain health
activities, suggesting that the former may be particularly amenable to
intervention. Future studies should assess whether the improvement in
everyday compensation strategies translate into slower rates of loss of
functional independence.

D. MUNGAS, C. DECARLI & L. BECKETT. Progression from
Normal Cognition to Mild Cognitive Impairment in a Diverse
Clinic- and Community-Based Elderly Cohort.
Objective: To investigate annual rate of conversion from normal cognition to mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and identify risk/protective
factors associated with diagnostic change.
Participants and Methods: Participants (n=267) who were clinically
confirmed as cognitively normal at baseline were followed up to seven
years as part of an ongoing prospective longitudinal study in a university
based Alzheimer’s center. Potential predictors of conversion included:
source of recruitment (either directly from the community or through
clinic-based referrals), demographic factors (age, gender, race/ethnicity,
year of education, APOE ε4 positive), and baseline measures of cognitive performance (executive function, memory), everyday function, and
neuroimaging measures (total brain volume, total hippocampal volume,
white matter hyperintensity volume).

165
Results: Of 267 participants, 66 (12 from the clinic, 54 from the community) progressed to MCI with a mean (SD) time of follow-up of
2.87 years (2.06) for clinic-based sample and 4.55 years (2.31) for the
community-based sample. The clinic-based sample showed an annual
conversion rate of 30% per year, whereas the community-based sample
showed a conversion rate of 4-6% per year. Being referred for a clinical
evaluation, older age, and worse baseline executive function and everyday function were all independent risk factors for conversion, while
larger standardized total brain volume was protective.
Conclusions: Having a concern about cognitive decline and/or being
referred for a clinical evaluation is a risk for the subsequent development
of MCI. Such findings are consistent with the emerging importance
of subjective cognitive concern in the literature and suggests that it
is important for this group of older adults to be followed with repeat
assessments. However, regardless of the presence of cognitive concern,
being older, having lower executive function and everyday functional,
and greater brain atrophy are also independently predictive of increased
risk for conversion to MCI.

N. DO, Y. XU, C.P. MOLDOVAN, A. ARÉCHIGA, S. RAJARAM &
J. SABATÉ. Predictors of Premorbid Intelligence and Cognitive
Decline.
Objective: Prior researchers have found that demographic factors,
attention, and working memory significantly impact premorbid intelligence (PI). PI is a predictor of overall cognitive functioning, a key
component to age-related dementias and neurodegenerative diseases.
As cognitive function decreases with age, it is important to examine the
determinants of cognitive decline prior to symptom onset. Executive
functioning has not yet been tested as a predictor of PI. Consequently,
the present investigation examined age, education, attention, working
memory, and executive functioning as predictors of PI in a sample of
healthy older adults.
Participants and Methods: 365 participants between the ages of 62-80
years were recruited through Loma Linda University (M = 69.57, SD
= 3.90). PI was assessed using the AMNART, attention was measured
using the Stroop Color-Word test, working memory was assessed using
the RAVLT, and executive functioning was measured using the TMT
(Part B).
Results: A hierarchical regression analysis was used to determine the
influence of age, education, working memory, attention, and executive
functioning on PI. Age and education were included in the first step of
the analysis, attention was added in the second step, working memory
was added in the third step, and executive functioning was added in
the fourth step. Overall, the regression model accounted for 35.6% of
the variance in PI, F(5,361) = 39.39, p < .001. PI was significantly
predicted by education (β = .540, t = 11.98, p < .001), attention (β
= .196, t = 4.30, p < .001), and executive functioning (β = -.100, t =
-2.21, p < .05).
Conclusions: Results of the current study support previous findings
showing that education and attention significantly predict PI, and introduce executive functioning as another predictor of PI. Further, results
suggest that executive function is an additional cognitive domain that
can be examined to predict cognitive decline before symptoms reach
clinical levels.

A.G. GERTSBERG, R.F. KAPLAN, N. LEGATE, L. STRAINGE
& J. CHASMAN. Cognitive reserve: The Role of Occupational
Experience.
Objective: High levels of education and occupational attainment have
been traditionally linked to preserved cognitive functioning in early dementia. This study explored relationships between specific occupational

166
skills and cognitive reserve, both overall and within specific cognitive
domains, in the normal elderly and early dementia.
Participants and Methods: One hundred eighty eight patients aged 3494 (M=75.45, SD=10.99) completed a neuropsychological test battery
as part of a routine clinical visit. A patient’s longest work experience
defined their occupation. Occupation abilities are rated by the U.S.
Department of Labor Occupation Information Network based on the
cognitive abilities needed to perform that work.
Results: Hierarchical multiple regressions were used to predict test
scores using age, gender, education, and occupational abilities as predictor variables. Occupations rated high in verbal skills predicted higher
verbal and language neuropsychological test scores above and beyond
education. Occupations requiring high verbal skills also protected performance in other cognitive domains, even when the effect of education
was no longer significant. Occupations rated high in verbal abilities
protect against cognitive decline in patients with dementia in domains
of executive functioning/processing speed, learning and memory, and
visuospatial/construction. These protective effects were limited to verbal
job experience. Other occupational skills did not predict neuropsychological test scores in any cognitive domain.
Conclusions: These findings indicate that occupation-related verbal
abilities, but not other occupation-related skills, predict higher neuropsychological test scores independent of education, particularly for individuals with dementia. Experience in other domains did not show better
neuropsychological test scores, even in those domains related to type of
work experience. These data suggest that it is the verbal components of
education rather than years of education underlying cognitive reserve.

Executive function and memory contributions to medication
management ability in cognitively normal, older adults.
Objective: Medication nonadherence among older adults may negatively influence or be influenced by physical and psychological health.
Critically, cognitive deficits can impair medication management that
could contribute to unintentional medication nonadherence in older
adults. Researchers have reported that executive function (EF) and
memory deficits in standardized measures are significantly related to
problems with medication management in clinical and aging populations. The purpose of our study, then, is to examine EF and memory
contributions to medication management ability in cognitively normal,
older adults using two novel computerized tasks that tap into EF and
memory domains.
Participants and Methods: Twenty six participants (Women, n = 24;
Mean Age = 72.9 years, SD= 8.4) completed the reversal task (RT),
transverse patterning task (TPT), and Medication Management Ability
Assessment (MMAA). RT is an executive function computerized task
dependent on the prefrontal cortex that is adapted from animal models
in which contingencies were learned and then reversed. TPT, an adaptation of the rock/paper/scissors problem, is a learning and memory
computerized task dependent on the hippocampus. The MMAA is a
role-play in which participants were given instructions for taking fake
medications and then were asked to inform the researcher how and
when they will take pills.
Results: Regression analyses revealed that better performance in the
TPT predicted higher scores on the MMAA (p=.033). Conversely, the
RT was not related to performance on the MMAA (p=.824).
Conclusions: The findings suggest that learning and memory as measured by TPT is more predictive of medication management compared
to EF as measured by RT. Importantly, the TPT may be useful in detecting and predicting impairments in medication management that could
ultimately affect medication adherence in aging populations.

E.Z. GROSS, E.M. HOLCOMB & J.L. WOODARD. Convergent and
Discriminant Validity of Ex-Gaussian Parameter Estimates.
Objective: Ex-Gaussian parameter estimation is a method for characterizing intra-individual variability of response times (RT) beyond
the mean and standard deviation (SD). This approach provides a third
parameter, τ, which accounts for variability in the right tail of the distribution. τ is independent of estimates of μ and σ, the central tendency
and dispersion of the RT distribution. τ represents attention, while μ and
σ are associated with processing speed. Prior research using this analytic
strategy has used tasks that strongly rely on these abilities, raising the
possibility that the associations simply reflect task demands. This study
used a semantic knowledge task to validate this approach.
Participants and Methods: Cognitively healthy older adults (N =
64; mean Age = 68.8) completed a two-choice semantic memory task
(famous or unfamiliar names) and a brief test battery. Bootstrapped
parameters were estimated separately for famous and unfamiliar stimuli. Correlations with attention (RAVLT Trial 1, Logical Memory I)
and processing speed (digit symbol, symbol search) were expected to
demonstrate convergent validity, while lack of correlations with executive function (Stroop), memory (LM II), and depressive symptoms
(GDS-15) were expected to demonstrate discriminant validity.
Results: Parameter estimates for unfamiliar names were not correlated
with any tests. Estimates for famous names were not significantly correlated with executive function, delayed recall, or depressive symptoms.
For famous names, all parameters correlated significantly with at least
one processing speed test, ranging from -.25 to -.33 (p < .05). Only τ
correlated with attentionally demanding measures: LM I (r = -.31, p <
.05) and RAVLT T1 (r = -.29, p < .05).
Conclusions: These results demonstrate good convergent and discriminant validity for ex-Gaussian parameter estimates using a semantic
memory task. Parameter estimates for lures did not correlate, while
estimates for targets did correlate with cognitive tests as hypothesized.

Injuries to The Brain: Which Holes Matter?
Objective: Perivascular spaces (PVS) are interstitial fluid filled cavities
that form between penetrating vessels and their surrounding parenchyma. PVS are common in older adults and often associated with
vascular risk factors. Findings regarding the extent to which PVS contribute to cognitive dysfunction are mixed. One important issue is how
measurement protocols distinguish between large PVS and lacunar infarcts. Informed by clinical-pathological correlates studies, we applied a
protocol to distinguish large PVS from infarcts. We tested the extent to
which total large PVS and infarct volumes relate to cognitive function
in older adults.
Participants and Methods: Participants included 331, non-demented,
older adults (mean age=80yrs) from a community based study of cognitive aging. Participants received structural MRI and neuropsychological
evaluation that yielded scores for overall cognition, memory, language,
executive, and visuospatial function. We calculated the total volume
of hypointense voids (>5mm) on axial T1weighted images that were
accompanied by a hyperintense rim on FLAIR images. Large PVS were
distinguished from infarcts based on anatomical distribution and FLAIR
characteristics. We examined the relationship of infarct and PVS volumes with cognition, controlling for age, sex, race/ethnicity, education,
and vascular factors.
Results: Total infarct volume was negatively associated with overall
cognitive function and executive function, but PVS did not correlate

Forty Fourth Annual INS Meeting Abstracts
with cognitive function. Mean total PVS volume was significantly greater
than mean total infarct volume and vascular risk factors were related
to both PVS and infarct volume.
Conclusions: Our results suggest that total infarct volume, but not
large PVS, are associated with poorer cognitive functioning. Careful
distinction between infarcts and PVS is important for understanding
the impact of vascular lesions on cognitive aging.

group differences in relation to florbetapir-F18 PET retention or amyloid positivity; however, older ARB-users tended to show less amyloid
retention than other-antiHTN peers (ages: 70-75, p<.05; 76-91, p=.06).
Conclusions: Participants on antihypertensive drugs demonstrated
worse cognitive performance compared to those not taking these drugs,
unless they were ARB-users. Older ARB-users tended to show less amyloid retention but differences in amyloid were less apparent than differences in cognition. Potential protective effects of ARBs on cognition may
involve amyloid-dependent and -independent mechanisms.

Burden and Functional Connectivity of Resting State Network in
Healthy Aging.
Objective: Healthy aging is associated with neural changes in both
structure and function yet the relationships between these changes
are not fully understood. One manifestation of age-related structural
changes is an increase in white matter lesions. One manifestation of
age-related functional changes is a decrease in resting state functional
connectivity. We investigated whether white matter lesions affected resting state networks across a wide-range age sample. We hypothesized
that individuals with higher lesion burden (older individuals) would
have a less functionally connected resting state network compared to
individuals with less lesion burden (younger individuals).
Participants and Methods: Twenty-two (N = 22) participants ages
21-66 (M = 42.68 [SD = 12.26]; 17 female) were selected. White matter
lesion burden (LB) was estimated using T2-FLAIR magnetic resonance
imaging. Resting state connectivity was measured using quantitative
centrality (QC)- a measure of functional connectivity of each voxel
within the resting network.
Results: LB increased with age (r = .48 p < .05). QC decreased with age
in the default mode network (DMN) nodes (e.g., precuneus, hippocampal formation; all regions p < .05, k > 11). LB significantly predicted
decreases in QC within these regions (all ps < .05).
Conclusions: Age-related increases in LB appear to be associated with
disconnection of the DMN. These findings reflect a decrease in the overall cohesiveness of brain function as a result of increasing white matter
lesion burden during healthy aging.

J.K. HO & D.A. NATION. Protective Effects of Angiotensin II Type
1 Receptor Blockers on Cognition and Alzheimer’s Disease.
Objective: Findings from several observational studies and clinical trials
suggest that antihypertensive treatment may have beneficial effects on
cognition and highlight Angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockers (ARBs)
as a drug class that may provide the greatest benefit. We hypothesized
that ARB-users would display improved cognition and reduced amyloid
retention relative to other-antihypertensive-drug-users.
Participants and Methods: Participants were 1,626 non-demented
adults ages 55-91 from the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative.
804 participants used antihypertensive drugs. Three groups were compared: ARB-users, other-antihypertensive-drug-users (Other-antiHTN)
and a group that did not take any antihypertensive drugs (No-antiHTN).
Vascular risk burden, cognition, and florbetapir-fluorine-18 (F18) PET
retention were compared using ANCOVA, multiple linear regression
and chi-square tests.
Results: The Other-antiHTN group performed significantly worse than
the No-antiHTN group on Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test Immediate Recall (p=.004), Delayed Recall (p<.001), Recognition (p=.002),
Trails A (p<.001) and Trails B (p=.008), but ARB-users did not perform
significantly worse than the No-antiHTN group on any measures except
for Trails A (p=.005). The ARB users performed significantly better

Prospective Memory Uniquely Predicts Financial Management
Capacity in Older Adults.
Objective: Prospective memory (PM) may play an important role in
the ability of older adults to carry out complex activities of daily living.
Although PM is reliant on the integrity of other cognitive processes
(e.g., executive function), evidence suggests that PM may be a unique
predictor of self-reported everyday functioning in older adults, over
and above other cognitive abilities. The aim of the current study was to
utilize performance-based assessments to examine the incremental value
of PM in predicting medication and financial management capacity in
older adults.
Participants and Methods: Participants included 57 healthy older
adults who were administered performance-based measures of the
constructs of interest, including Memory for Intentions Screening Test
(MIST) for prospective memory, Advanced Finances Test (AFT) for
financial management, and Medication Management Ability Assessment
(MMAA) for medication management. Participants also completed a set
of standardized neuropsychological assessments.
Results: A separate hierarchical linear regression was conducted for
each of the everyday functioning measures. In Step 1 of each analysis,
demographic factors (age, education, gender) and an executive function
composite score were entered. In Step 2, time-based and event-based
scales from the MIST were entered. Results revealed that time-based
scores uniquely predicted scores on AFT (p < .05). However, neither
MIST score was a significant predictor of MMAA scores.
Conclusions: The results suggest that PM ability uniquely contributes
to functional capacity in older adults. However, the role of PM in everyday functioning may not be ubiquitous in all functional activities. The
specific relationship between time-based PM and financial management
suggests that financial management capacity in older adults may depend
on strategic, self-initiated retrieval processes. Overall, the results of this
study suggest that performance-based assessment of PM may play an
important role in evaluations of functional capacity in older adults.

M. JOANNETTE, D. GANDINI, I. ROULEAU, M. LAVALLÉE,
G. VALLET & S. JOUBERT. The Ability to Detect Changes in the
Spatial Relations of Faces Is Impaired in Alzheimer’s Disease.
Objective: Persons suffering from Alzheimer’s disease (AD) present with
difficulties in recognizing familiar faces. Even though specific memory
disturbances may be accountable, it is not known however if face perception deficits may also explain some of these difficulties. Therefore,
the aim of the current study was to investigate if AD patients showed
impaired visuoperceptual processing of faces. It was hypothesized that
patients would have difficulties processing spatial relations in faces.
Participants and Methods: 18 mild AD patients and 19 matched
healthy elderly controls completed a same/different unfamiliar face
discrimination task. To assess whether configural strategies in face
processing were impaired in AD, participants had to detect changes in
the distance between the eyes (horizontal axis) and between the mouth

168
and the nose (vertical axis). As a control task, participants had to process faces where local attributes such as the eyes or the mouth had been
changed by those of another face.
Results: Independent samples t-tests were carried out between the
two groups of participants for reaction times (RT) and error rates
(ER). Overall, no differences were found between AD patients and
controls when specific local parts such as the mouth or the eyes had
been changed. AD patients, however, showed significantly longer RT
(p<0.01) and higher ER (p<0.01) relative to controls in their ability to
detect changes in the distance between the mouth and nose. In regard
to their ability to detect changes in the distance between the eyes, AD
patients showed significantly worse ER (p<0.05) and a trend toward
significance was also found in terms of RT (p=0.07).
Conclusions: Persons suffering from mild AD seem to present with
difficulties in processing faces at a configural level (i.e. changes in second-order relations) but do not seem to be affected when required to
detect local changes in facial configurations. These results provide new
insights on the specific face perception mechanisms that may be affected
in the disease.

& M. LAMAR. The Separate and Interactive Effects of Trauma and
Depression on Cognition in Urban Dwelling Adults.
Objective: Approximately 89% of urban dwellers have experienced
traumatic events defined by exposure to actual or threatened death,
serious injury, or sexual violation. Trauma exposure puts one at risk for
depression and various cognitive alterations including slowed attention/
information processing (AIP). Depression alone may also impact AIP.
Little work has been done investigating the comorbid contributions
trauma and depression have on cognition.
Participants and Methods: We examined the separate and interactive
effects of Trauma and Depression on AIP and other cognitive domains
in urban dwellers ranging in age from 30-89 (~56+13yrs): 78 depressed
adults with trauma, 62 depressed adults without trauma, 69 euthymic
adults with trauma, and 93 euthymic adults without trauma. All completed i) a comprehensive psychological evaluation including the SCID
to assess trauma history and depression, objective and subjective depression measures; ii) a comprehensive neuropsychological assessment
including tests of EF, AIP, learning and memory.
Results: 2X2 ANCOVAs controlling for age revealed no interactions
across cognitive domains and a main effect of trauma on AIP only,
F(4,282)=5.09,p=0.02. Participants with trauma performed worse on
AIP, driven primarily by WAIS-III Digit Span-Forward performance
[F(2,294)=5.12,p=0.02].
Conclusions: Results suggest individuals with trauma have difficulty
with AIP such that they cannot focus attention on verbally mediated
information for immediate rote recall – an area where cognitive training
may prove useful for these trauma-exposed individuals. Results did not
suggest an interaction of trauma and depression on cognition or a main
effect of depression; this may be due, in part, to our wide age range,
issues of depression severity and/or duration in our population.

Objective Cognitive and Functional Loss and Dementia Risk in
Subjective Cognitive Decline.
Objective: Subjective cognitive decline (SCD) is common in cognitively
normal for age individuals but is not well understood. We analyzed SCD
in relation to [1] longitudinal cognitive scores, [2] functional activities of
daily living, and [3] incidence of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and

dementia in a large, longitudinal dataset from the National Alzheimer’s
Coordinating Center.
Participants and Methods: The sample included participants who
were over age 65, designated as having “normal cognition” (CDR=0,
MMSE>26), with at least two annual neuropsychological evaluations
(mean=4.5), and no more than “mild” baseline depression (GDS<8/15).
SCD was based on the single question, “Does the subject report a decline in memory relative to previously attained abilities?” at baseline
(no=763, yes=3152). T-tests and Chi-square analyses were used to compare groups on average rates of change (best linear unbiased predictors) on 8 neuropsychological tests, total baseline Functional Assessment
Questionnaire scores, and incidence rates of MCI and dementia over a
five-year period.
Results: Compared to the group without SCD, the group with SCD had
greater decline in processing speed (Coding, Trails A), naming (Boston Naming Test), and executive attention (Trails B), reduced episodic
memory practice effects (Logical Memory Immediate and Delayed Recall) (all p < 0.005), more restrictions in independent living abilities at
baseline (p < 0.001), and higher five-year incidence of both MCI (17%
v 12%) and dementia (6% v 4%, both p < 0.05).
Conclusions: Results support the hypothesis that SCD may be a harbinger of cognitive decline and dementia. In a sizable sample of cognitively normal older adults, those with SCD showed subtle weaknesses in
longitudinal cognitive performance and independent living abilities and
were more likely to develop MCI and dementia. Reduced psychomotor
speed and a lack of episodic memory practice effects may be objective
cognitive markers related to SCD.

J. MANLY, C. DECARLI, Y. STERN & A.M. BRICKMAN. The Cost
of Brain Aging: Medicare Expenditure Correlates of Atrophy and
Cerebrovascular Disease in Older Adults.
Objective: It is well documented that MRI-derived age-associated atrophic and cerebrovascular markers are strongly related to several clinical
outcomes. Despite the known clinical and functional correlates, their
financial costs are poorly understood. We studied whether increased
Medicare expenditures were associated with brain markers of atrophy
and cerebrovascular disease in older adults.
Participants and Methods: Using high resolution structural MRI data
from 592 diverse participants in a community-based study of cognitive
aging, we determined the association of Medicare expenditure data,
averaged over the ten year period prior to scan acquisition, with markers
of brain atrophy (i.e., whole-brain and hippocampal volume), and cerebrovascular disease burden (i.e., white matter hyperintensity volume
and presence of infarcts).
Results: Increased Medicare spending was associated with higher white
matter hyperintensity volume, presence of cerebral infarcts, and smaller
total brain volume. When examining specific components of Medicare
expenditures, we found that inpatient spending was strongly associated
with white matter hyperintensity volume and that increased ratios of
inpatient-to-outpatient and inpatient-to-total spending were associated
with infarcts. These associations were independent of dementia status,
medical burden, and several demographic features.
Conclusions: The findings suggest that increased health care system
costs are associated with measures of vascular brain injury and atrophy
in this ethnically diverse community sample. As the size of the older
adult population continues to increase, future work should focus on
strategies to prevent or delay these age-associated cerebral changes.

G. VALLET & S. JOUBERT. Holistic face processing is impaired
in Alzheimer’s disease and Lewy Body dementia.
Objective: Difficulties in the ability to recognize familiar persons have
been reported in both Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and Lewy Body dementia (LBD). It is unclear, however, to what extent these difficulties may
be due to underlying difficulties in facial perception. One paradigm
which allows testing both analytic and holistic face processing strategies
is the face-inversion effect (FIE). The FIE reflects a normal decline in
performance when matching inverted faces relative to upright faces. In
contrast, a reduction or suppression of the FIE may reflect difficulties
in holistic processing of faces. The aim of the present study was to
investigate the FIE in mild AD and LBD.
Participants and Methods: 25 mild AD patients, 10 mild LBD patients
and 25 healthy elderly adults (HE) participated in a study in which they
were required to match upright or inverted faces. Moreover, in order
to assess the specificity of the FIE, participants were also required to
match upright or inverted cars in the same experiment.
Results: For each group of participants (HE, AD, and LBD), repeated
measures ANOVAs were carried out on errors rates (ER) and reaction
times (RT). Category (cars vs. faces) and Presentation (upright vs. inverted) were used as within-subjects variables. ER analysis revealed
that only HE showed an interaction between Category and Presentation,
typical of the FIE. In regard to RT, HE and DLB patients exhibited a
significant interaction between Category and Presentation, but not AD
patients.
Conclusions: In regard to error rates, both AD and LBD patients
showed a reduction in the FIE relative to controls. In regard to RT,
only AD patients showed a reduction in the FIE. These results seem to
suggest that holistic processing strategies are impaired in AD. They also
appear to be affected in LBD but to a lesser extent.

C. MCALISTER & M. SCHMITTER-EDGECOMBE. Executive
Function Subcomponents and their Relations to Everyday
Functioning in Healthy Older Adults.
Objective: Everyday functioning and its executive functioning cognitive
correlates were investigated in healthy older adults (HOAs) using multiple methods of functional status. We were especially interested in the
contributions of both process pure and traditional measures of the executive function subcomponents of switching, inhibition, and updating.
Participants and Methods: Seventy HOAs (45 young-old and 25 oldold) and 70 younger adults completed executive function and neuropsychological tests. In addition to self- and informant questionnaires of
functional abilities, HOAs completed two performance-based measures.
Results: An aging effect was found on all executive function measures.
Old-old older adults and their informants did not report more functional
difficulties, but demonstrated more difficulties on performance-based
measures relative to young-old participants. For the HOAs, after controlling for age and education, the traditional, but not process pure,
executive function measures explained a significant amount of variance
in the informant-report and both performance-based measures. Updating measures differentially predicted performance-based measures,
while switching was a unique predictor of informant-report and problem-solving measures.
Conclusions: These findings highlight the importance of taking a fractionated approach to the study of executive functioning and functional
status, and suggest that switching and updating abilities may contribute
to age-related decline of everyday functioning in HOAs.

C. MCALISTER & M. SCHMITTER-EDGECOMBE. Everyday
Functioning and Cognitive Correlates in Healthy Older Adults
with Subjective Cognitive Concerns.
Objective: Few studies have examined functional abilities and complaints in healthy older adults with subjective cognitive concerns (SCC).
The aims of this study were to assess everyday functioning in healthy
older adults with varying SCC, and examine cognitive correlates of
functional abilities.
Participants and Methods: Twenty-six healthy older adults with high
SCC, and 27 healthy older adults with low SCC, as well as their knowledgeable informants completed the Instrumental Activities of Daily
Living-Compensation (IADL-C), a questionnaire measure of everyday
functioning.
Results: Although the high SCC group did not self-report more physical
limitations or depressive symptoms, compared with the low SCC group,
they self-reported significantly more everyday difficulties. Compared to
the low SCC group, informants for the high SCC group endorsed more
difficulties on the IADL-C and specifically the money and self-management, and social skills subdomains. For the high SCC group, poorer
self-report of everyday functioning was related to poorer executive
functioning, while the informant-report was related to temporal order
memory. No significant associations were found for the low SCC group.
Conclusions: These findings indicate that there may be subtle functional changes that occur early in the spectrum of cognitive decline in
individuals with high SCC. Individuals with both SCC and functional
difficulties may be at an even higher risk for progression to dementia.

C. MURPHY. MetS and Cortical Thickness of Entorhinal Cortex
in Middle-Aged and Older Adults.
Objective: We had two objectives: 1) To examine differences in cortical
thickness of entorhinal cortex in middle aged and older adults with and
without metabolic syndrome (MetS), 2) To explore the contribution of
type II diabetes (T2DM) to any differences in cortical thickness.
Participants and Methods: Participants were 34 middle-aged and
41 older adults with and without MetS. Medical histories, medication
use and clinical data were acquired prior to imaging. T1-weighted MRI
scans were acquired at 3.0T. Structural images were processed using the
Freesurfer image analysis suite. Analyses of covariance were performed
to investigate group differences (MetS vs. control) in entorhinal cortical
thickness separately in middle-aged and older adults. These analyses
were repeated excluding participants diagnosed with T2DM.
Results: Group analyses revealed less cortical thickness in the left entorhinal cortex in middle-aged (p = 0.007; η2 = 0.228) but not older
adults (p > 0.05) with MetS. When excluding participants with T2DM,
these differences remained in middle-aged adults (p = 0.029; η2 =
0.199).
Conclusions: The findings in this study demonstrated that middle-aged
adults, but not older adults, with MetS have decreased entorhinal cortical thickness relative to those without MetS. The medial temporal lobe
(MTL), particularly the entorhinal cortex, is the site of early Alzheimer’s disease pathology. Past studies show metabolic and cardiovascular abnormalities, especially in middle age, increase risk for cognitive
impairment and dementia. The present results indicated that T2DM, a
condition associated with MTL atrophy and dementia, was not sufficient
to explain the findings. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that MetS
in midlife may negatively impact brain structure and further supports
the notion that middle age may be a sensitive period in determining risk
for pathological aging.

Blood Glucose Mediates the Relationship between Cognitive
Function and Sleep Quality in Middle-Aged Adults.
Objective: Previous work suggests that sleep disturbances and hyperglycemia independently contribute to impaired cognitive function. However, since fragmented sleep promotes alterations in glucose metabolism,
it is possible that the negative impact of sleep problems on cognitive
test performance is driven by disturbances in glucose metabolism. The
purpose of the current study was to examine the relationship between
sleep quality, blood glucose, and cognitive function in a healthy, middle-aged population.
Participants and Methods: One hundred twenty-three participants
(mean age = 49.76, 50% male), ages 40-60, completed the Medical
Outcomes Sleep (MOS) questionnaire, a full neuropsychological assessment, and a general health assessment, including a fasting blood draw,
to assess for glucose levels.
Results: Linear regression models adjusted for age, education level, and
gender were used for the analyses. Results demonstrated that greater
sleep problems positively correlated with higher glucose levels (B= .27,
p= .002) and worse performance (B= .22, p= .01) on Trails B. Likewise,
higher glucose levels indicated worse performance (B= .24, p= .007)
on Trails B. A mediation analysis, using Baron & Kenny’s traditional
causal steps approach, revealed that sleep no longer predicted worse
performance on Trails B when adjusted for glucose levels (B= .15, p=
.089). Results of the Sobel test, used to test for indirect effect, were also
significant (p= .04).
Conclusions: These findings indicate that greater sleep problems correlate with worse performance on Trails B as a result of higher glucose

M.B. MEMEL, H. RITCHIE & L. RYAN. The Role of Visual
Integration and Working Memory in Age-Related Associative
Memory Deficits.
Objective: Associative memory is selectively impaired during healthy
aging, but the mechanisms responsible for this decline are not fully
understood. The relationship between visual integration of stimuli and
associative memory performance is relatively unexplored. Differences
between age groups in the ability to bind visually integrated and non-integrated stimuli might contribute to our understanding of the associative
memory deficit. We hypothesize that older adults may perform similarly
to young when visual stimuli are integrated and will be particularly
impaired when visual stimuli require integration.
Participants and Methods: Twenty-four older adults and nineteen
young adults studied photographs of typical household objects and
realistic scenes. In the integrated condition, an object was positioned
naturally in a scene. In the separated condition, an object was presented
on a white background next to and visually distinct from a scene. An
associative recognition task followed. Three executive function measures
(updating, task-switching, inhibition) were collected during a separate
neuropsychological battery.
Results: Older adults responded with more false alarms than young
across conditions. However, both groups exhibited a similar pattern of
increased false alarms in response to separated pairs. No interaction between condition and age group was observed. Executive function scores,
specifically updating and task-switching, were differentially related to
associative recognition.
Conclusions: In line with the associative binding deficit (Naveh-Benjamin, 2000), older adults were more susceptible to false alarms than
young across conditions. In contrast to our hypothesis, both groups
experienced a similar decrease in accuracy when required to integrate
visually distinct items, suggesting visual integration does not overcome
the age-related binding deficit. Importantly, individual differences in

working memory amongst older adults predicted associative recognition,
with the high updating group performing as well as young.

M.W. BONDI, S. WOODS, D.C. DELIS & P. GILBERT. Recall and
Recognition Discriminability in Healthy Aging.
Objective: Performance on verbal memory tests is known to decline with
age. The California Verbal Learning Test–Second Edition (CVLT-II)
includes a new experimental measure termed recall discriminability,
which is analogous to recognition discriminability. Discriminability
scores from the CVLT-II are expressed as a single d’ score, which provides the opportunity to make direct comparisons between recall and
recognition raw scores. The objective of the present study was to examine the effect of age as a continuous variable on each CVLT-II score of
recall and recognition discriminability in a sample of healthy adults.
Participants and Methods: Participants were 193 healthy adults 1891 years old (M=46.78, SD=23.47), 93 of which were female. Participants were administered the CVLT-II as part of a larger neuropsychological test battery. Age was the independent variable of interest. Raw
recall discriminability scores (Total, Immediate, Delayed, Free, and
Cued) and recognition discriminability scores (Total, Source, Semantic,
and Novel) were the dependent variables of interest.
Results: Multiple regression analyses revealed that performance on
each CVLT-II measure of recall and recognition discriminability significantly decreased as age increased, controlling for gender and education (ps<.001).
Conclusions: The findings indicate that recall and recognition discriminability scores from the CVLT-II decline with increasing age. These
measures might provide more accurate assessments of recall and recognition abilities, by quantifying target words recalled relative to intrusion
errors (recall) and hit rates relative to false positive rates (recognition).

R. MORIN & E. MIDLARSKY. Predictors of WAIS Vocabulary
Among Black and White Older Adults.
Objective: Vocabulary scores tend to be significantly related to education in heterogeneous groups of older adults, even after controlling for
confounding variables. However, there may be other factors that impinge on cognitive functioning for certain demographic groups, particularly among older adults whose educational opportunities were limited
and who may have experienced considerable stress as a result of their
minority status. This study explores possible predictors of vocabulary
scores in Black and White older adults.
Participants and Methods: In this study, samples of Black (N=165)
and White (N=146) community-dwelling older adults reported their
level of education, perceived health status, number of stressful life
events, and were administered the WAIS-R vocabulary subtest.
Results: Among the White participants, level of education was the only
significant predictor of vocabulary score after controlling for perceived
health and exposure to stress. Among Black participants, education
was also a significant predictor of vocabulary score, however perceived
health and number of stressful life events were also significantly predictive of vocabulary score.
Conclusions: Findings indicate that for certain cohorts of older adults,
especially those who may have experienced stressful life circumstances
and health disparities as a result of societal racial inequality, education
may not be the only variable that predicts verbal intelligence. The importance of investigating cognitive functioning within a broader sociocultural context is discussed.

T.H. GOLLAN, D. GALASKO & D.P. SALMON. Associations
between Subjective Cognitive Decline, Depression, and Objective
Cognitive Performance in Hispanic Elderly.
Objective: Cognitive complaints are common in the elderly and this
subjective cognitive decline (SCD) has been viewed as a subtle but
meaningful change that may relate to neurodegeneration. However,
we recently found that SCD was more closely related to symptoms of
depression than to objective cognitive impairment in a random sample
of community-based older adults. Whether or not this is also true in a
clinic-based sample where cognitive complaints may be more specific,
or in cohorts with culturally distinct views of cognitive or depressive
symptoms, remains unknown.
Participants and Methods: We examined this issue in 149 patients age
60 or older (mean=74.02 years, SD=7.6) referred by community health
clinics for screening of cognitive impairment. All patients were Hispanic,
lived near the U.S.-Mexico border, and spoke Spanish only or were
Spanish-English bilingual (mean education=7.8 years, 61.7% women).
Memory-only and overall cognitive composites were created from scores
on Spanish versions of the CERAD Memory Test, Logical Memory, Animal Fluency, and Trail-Making A. The Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS)
and a five-item SCD questionnaire were also completed. Participants
with frank cognitive impairment (MMSE<24) were excluded.
Results: Multiple linear regression analyses showed little association
between SCD and overall cognitive scores (B=.039; p=.287) or memory-only composite scores (B=.001; p=.982) after adjusting for age,
education, and GDS score. In contrast, there was a significant association between GDS and SCD (B=.214; p=.001) after adjusting for age,
education, and overall (B=.214; p=.001) or memory-only composite
scores (B=.213; p=.001).
Conclusions: These results suggest that SCD does not accurately reflect current cognitive status in non-demented elderly Hispanic adults.
Clinical interpretation of SCD in this population should be made in the
context of information about symptoms of depression. The prognostic
value of SCD for future cognitive decline or neurodegeneration in this
population remains unknown.

S. OLESON, D. EAGAN, S. KAUR, M.E. PEARMAN, H. TANAKA &
A. HALEY. Apolipoprotein E Genotype Moderates the Relationship
Between Carotid Atherosclerosis and Executive Function in
Middle-Aged Adults.
Objective: Increased carotid artery intima-media thickness (IMT) is
an indicator of systemic arterial disease and has been linked with detriments in cognitive performance and risk for future cognitive decline.
However, the role of genetic factors in moderating these relationships is
still unknown. A potential candidate gene of interest is the Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) gene, as the ε4 allele of this gene is a known risk factor
for atherosclerosis as well as Alzheimer’s disease and vascular dementia.
Previous work has suggested that the presence of both the ApoE ε4 allele
and increased IMT may accelerate the progression of dementia. The purpose of the present study was to investigate whether the ApoE genotype
moderates the relationship between IMT and cognitive performance in
cognitively healthy middle-aged adults.
Participants and Methods: Seventy-two middle-aged adults were
grouped according to ApoE genotype (ε4 carrier or ε4 non-carrier)
and underwent a neuropsychological assessment and B-mode ultrasound
of the common carotid artery. The distance between the luminal-endothelial interface and the junction between the media and adventitia
was used to quantify IMT.

171
Results: An analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) revealed a significant
interaction between ApoE genotype and IMT when controlling for age,
gender, education level, and body mass index, suggesting that greater
IMT was associated with significantly lower executive-attention function
in ε4 carriers, but not in ε4 non-carriers, F(1,64) = 8.60, p = .005.
Conclusions: Increased IMT was associated with poorer executive function in cognitively healthy middle-aged adults who were positive for the
ApoE ε4 allele, but not in ApoE ε4 non-carriers. Interventions targeting the treatment of early atherosclerotic changes may be particularly
important for supporting cognitive functioning in ApoE ε4 carriers.

C.E. PERRY, D.W. HEDGES, S.D. GALE, E. WILSON, J.S. KAUWE
& L. ERICKSON. Latent Toxoplasmosis Association with Executive
Function in Older Adults.
Objective: Objective: While latent infection with the intraneuronal protozoal parasite Toxoplasma gondii (T. gondii) has been associated with
cognitive changes humans, little is known about its relationship with
specific domains of cognitive functioning in older adults. We examined
the effect of latent toxoplasmosis on executive functioning in non-demented older adults.
Participants and Methods: Participants and Methods: We received
serum and cognitive data from 114 older adults from Washington
University’s ADRC project. To determine latent toxoplasmosis status,
we used micro-enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) analysis. Executive functioning was determined by standardized cognitive
tests (Trails B, WMS Mental Control, Word Fluency Letter S, Category
Fluency – Animals & Vegetables), which we combined into an executive functioning domain z-score. To determine if latent toxoplasmosis
predicted executive functioning scores, we used multiple regression
controlling for age, socioeconomic status, education and ApoE status.
Results: Results: In women, latent toxoplasmosis predicted a lower executive functioning domain score. In the overall sample, the presence of the
ApoE4 allele predicted poorer performance on the executive functioning
domain score. In addition, scores on the WMS Mental Control measure
were higher in those positive for latent toxoplasmosis and those without
ApoE E4, whereas Category Fluency scores were significantly higher in
those without latent toxoplasmosis and without ApoE E4. Finally, scores
on WMS Letter Number Sequencing were significantly higher for those
with latent toxoplasmosis but without ApoE E4.
Conclusions: Conclusions: The presence of latent toxoplasmosis was
associated with poorer executive functioning in older women but not
in men, suggesting a sex difference. Latent toxoplasmosis may also
interact with ApoE E4 status to affect performance on some tasks of
executive functioning with latent toxoplasmosis associated with worse
performance on some tasks and better performance on others.

C.E. PERRY, D.W. HEDGES, S.D. GALE, E. WILSON, J.S. KAUWE
& L. ERICKSON. Association between Memory Functioning and
Latent Toxoplasmosis in Older Adults.
Objective: Objective: Latent infection with the intraneuronal protozoal
parasite Toxoplasma gondii (T. gondii) has been associated with cognitive changes in rodents and humans. Little is known about its effect on
memory in older adults. We investigated the association between latent
toxoplasmosis and memory in non-demented older adults.
Participants and Methods: Participants and Methods: From Washington University’s ADRC project, we obtained serum and cognitive
data from 114 healthy older adults (average age 79.7 years). We evaluated latent toxoplasmosis status with micro-enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) analysis and memory function obtained from

172
standardized cognitive tests (WMS-R Logical Memory IA & IIA, WMS-R
Associate Learning, Free and Cued Selective Reminding Test) combined
into a memory domain z-score. We used t-tests and multiple regressions
to determine if latent toxoplasmosis predicted memory scores while
controlling for age, socioeconomic status, education and ApoE status.
Results: Results: Thirty-three percent of the sample was positive for
latent Toxoplasmosis. In males, higher antibody titers of latent T. gondii
predicted better performance on the memory domain score. The interaction between antibody titers and age also predicted performance on
the domain score for males. No associations were seen in the female
samples. Additionally, carriers of the ApoE E4 allele positive for latent toxoplasmosis did not have significantly different memory domain
scores or individual memory test scores than did non-carriers and/or
negative for latent toxoplasmosis.
Conclusions: Conclusions: Latent toxoplasmosis may be associated
with better memory in non-demented older men but not in older women.
Additionally, ApoE E4 status did not affect memory performance in
either those with or without latent toxoplasmosis. This sample has the
oldest participants to date to test the association between latent toxoplasmosis and memory functioning.

studied in this regard. To investigate the role of non-cognitive factors
to late-life cognition and decline, we examined the contribution of adolescent academic achievement, controlling for IQ, to late-life cognition
and its decline in a general population sample.
Participants and Methods: Participants included 3,826 respondents
in the Wisconsin Longitudinal Study, a random sample of Wisconsin
high school graduates followed from 1957 to 2011. Immediate and
delayed word list recall at ages 64 and 71 were examined as a function
of high school class rank, controlling for IQ, an index of non-cognitive
influences on achievement.
Results: Controlling for IQ, high school class rank significantly predicted immediate and delayed recall at age 64. While the relative contributions of adolescent IQ and class rank to immediate memory were
comparable, class rank was the only significant predictor of delayed
memory. Controlling for performance at age 64, adolescent IQ and class
rank were both predictive of immediate and delayed recall at age 71.
However, IQ was more strongly associated with memory performance
longitudinally.
Conclusions: These results suggest that non-cognitive influences on
achievement in adolescence are equally, if not more, predictive of latelife cognitive functioning than IQ.

C.B. FORTIER, W.P. MILBERG & R. MCGLINCHEY. Cardiometabolic Outcomes Following Close-Range Blast Exposure.
Objective: Veterans returning from Iraq and Afghanistan are at risk
for a variety of physical and psychological ailments. This population
of Veterans has previously shown early signs of aging, such as poor
cardiovascular health, hypertension, and metabolic syndrome (Lohr
et al 2015). Recent findings also reveal that close-range blast exposure
(CBE), even without concussion, is associated with neurological abnormalities, memory deficits, and risk for psychological illness. This study
specifically addresses whether CBE is associated with increased risk
for cardio-metabolic dysfunction and indices of psychological health
and well-being.
Participants and Methods: Veterans in the TRACTS study (mean age=
31.68) who reported being within 10 meters of a blast (CBE, n=146)
were compared to those who had not (noCBE, n=183) on empirically-derived cardio-metabolic factors such as blood pressure, cholesterol,
glucose, and obesity, as well as other health and psychological variables
including pain, sleep, anxiety, stress, depression, and overall well-being.
All analyses were completed while controlling for age, gender, education,
number of mTBIs, and current PTSD diagnosis.
Results: The CBE group demonstrated significantly elevated scores on
a blood pressure factor (indicative of higher BP) as well as on a physical
health factor consisting of obesity and cholesterol variables (indicative
of poorer health). The CBE group also reported worse sleep and higher
anxiety. There were no differences between the groups on measures of
pain, stress, depression, or overall well-being.
Conclusions: CBE is associated with poorer cardio-metabolic health,
including higher blood pressure, higher cholesterol, and obesity, as well
as worse psychological functioning. Future research is needed to better
understand the relationships between blast exposure and physical and
mental health.

Alexithymia in Younger and Older Adults.
Objective: Alexithymia is defined by difficulty identifying and verbalizing one’s emotions; it is associated with volumetric differences in brain
structures linked to emotion processing in young adults (e.g., Borsci et
al., 2009). There are few data on differential neuroanatomical substrates
of alexithymia in older and younger adults but this is important to study
because age-related atrophy may differentially impact emotion processing regions. This study determined the neuroanatomical correlates of
alexithymia in younger and older adults.
Participants and Methods: Participants were healthy, right-handed
young (n = 11, aged 21–29) and older adults (n = 10, aged 62–74) who
completed the Toronto Alexithymia Scale. Brain imaging data were acquired using a 3T Philips Achieva scanner. Scans were high resolution
T1 weighted magnetization-prepared rapid acquisition with gradient
echo volumes.
Results: In young adults, alexithymia was correlated with volume of the
left isthmus of the cingulate gyrus (r = .62), left lateral occipital cortex
(r = .71), and left transverse temporal gyrus (r = .70; ps < .05). In older
adults, alexithymia was correlated with volume of the right caudal ACC
(r = -.79), right pars orbitalis (r = .76), right pars triangularis (r = .64),
left caudal middle frontal region (r = .63), and right paracentral lobule
(r = .86, ps < .05).
Conclusions: These were the first data to look separately at neural
correlates of alexithymia in older and younger adults. In young adults,
alexithymia was associated with diffuse brain structures in the temporal, occipital, and limbic regions; in older adults, alexithymia was
more localized to prefrontal/frontal regions. Positive correlations between frontal structures and alexithymia in older adults may indicate a
need for additional resources to execute emotion processing with greater
alexithymia (Goerlich-Dobre et al., 2014). These preliminary results
suggest potentially different neural underpinnings of alexithymia in
older and younger persons.

K. GRAJZEL, J.W. GRIFFIN & B.E. GAVETT. Measurement
Invariance of Dementia Severity in (δ).
Objective: Royall and colleagues identified the latent dementia phenotype, δ, which represents the concomitant cognitive and functional
changes of dementia severity; it was supported in numerous samples
using various cognitive tests as indicators. However, it requires a formal study of its measurement invariance (MI) to establish equivalency
across clinical groups.
Participants and Methods: From 24660 participants in the National
Alzheimer’s Coordinating Center (NACC), overall model fit of δ was
assessed within initial visit assessment data across clinical diagnostic
categories: healthy controls (n=10670), mild cognitive impairment
(n=3343), Alzheimer’s Disease (n=8840), Dementia with Lewy Bodies
(DLB; n=641), Vascular Dementia (VaD; n=362), Frontal Temporal
Dementia (FTD; n=804), and all categories combined. The fit of a previously published measurement model for δ was examined after imposing
increasingly rigid structural constraints across the six diagnostic groups
to assess for MI.
Results: In this cross-sectional sample, δ fit the data well overall
(CFI=0.978, RMSEA=0.068) and achieved configural invariance (CFI
= 0.973, RMSEA = 0.053). Significant reductions in fit were observed
when comparing weak invariance to configural invariance (χ2 = 1239.5,
p < .01), strong invariance to weak invariance (χ2 = 704.8, p < .01),
and “strong-plus” invariance to strong invariance (χ2 = 488.7, p < .01).
However, the “strong-plus” model remained a good fit for the data when
judged by other fit statistics (CFI = 0.952, RMSEA = 0.055).
Conclusions: Results indicate that δ possesses configural invariance
across six diagnostic groups. Although increasing constraints significantly reduced model fit, this is expected with a large sample size and
associated power. Additional research may support the “strong-plus”
invariance of δ, providing more evidence for its value as a measure of
dementia severity.

C. MORENO & P. GILBERT. Age-Related Differences on a New
Test of Temporal Order Memory for Everyday Tasks.
Objective: Aging is known to have detrimental effects on memory for
the order of items or events in a sequence. We designed a new test to
examine age-related differences in incidental temporal order memory for
a self-generated sequence of tasks one might complete in everyday life.
Participants and Methods: Young (18-25 years; n=45) and older (65+
years; n=30) adults completed a memory task assessing immediate free
recall, delayed free recall, and delayed cued recall for the temporal order
of events in a sequence. Participants were given 10 cards, each listing
a task one might accomplish in a typical day (e.g. Going to the ATM).
Participants were asked to self generate a “to do” list by placing the 10
cards in a temporal sequence representing the order in which they would
accomplish the tasks. Participants were not informed of a subsequent
memory test during generation of the sequence (encoding). Immediate
recall was assessed by asking participants to verbally list the tasks in
the same order as the sequence generated during encoding. Following
a 20 min delay, delayed recall was assessed using the same procedure.
Finally, cued delayed recall for the sequence and recognition memory
for the individual items in the sequence were assessed.
Results: Older adults were significantly impaired relative to young
adults on immediate recall (p < .05), delayed recall (p < .01), and
cued delayed recall (p < .001) of the sequence. However, all participants
correctly recognized 90% or more of the events from the sequence.
Conclusions: We found evidence for age-related deficits in temporal
order memory for a self-generated sequence (with incidental encoding)
consistent with an encoding profile (poor immediate, delayed, and cued
recall), in the context intact recognition for items in the sequence. Our

aspects of temporal order memory important in everyday life.

T. SEIDER, R.A. COHEN & A. WOODS. Cognitively Engaging
Activity is Associated with Preserved Cortical and Subcortical
Volumes.
Objective: As the population ages and dementia becomes a growing
healthcare concern, it is increasingly important to identify targets for
intervention to delay or attenuate cognitive decline. Research has shown
that the most successful interventions aim at altering lifestyle factors.
Thus, this study examined how involvement in physical, cognitive, and
social activity is related to brain structure in older adults.
Participants and Methods: Sixty-five adults (mean age = 71.4 years,
standard deviation = 8.9) received the Community Healthy Activities
Model Program for Seniors (CHAMPS), a questionnaire that polls everyday activities in which older adults may be involved, and structural
MRIs. Stepwise regression with backwards selection was used to predict
weekly time spent in either social, cognitive, light physical, or heavy
physical activity from cortical and subcortical volumes (corrected by
total intracranial volume) as well as age, education, and gender as control variables.
Results: Regressions revealed that more time spent in cognitive activity
was associated with larger volumes of all brain regions studied: total
cortex (β = .289, p = .014), frontal (β = .276, p = .019), parietal (β =
.305, p = .009), temporal (β = .275, p = .020), and occipital (β = .256,
p = .030) lobes, and thalamus (β = .310, p = .010), caudate (β = .233,
p = .049), hippocampus (β = .286, p = .017), and amygdala (β = .336,
p = .004). These effects remained even after accounting for the positive
association between cognitive activity and education. No other activity
variable was associated with brain volumes.
Conclusions: Results indicate that time spent in cognitively engaging
activity is associated with preserved cortical and subcortical brain volume. Findings suggest that interventions aimed at increasing levels of
cognitive activity may delay cognitive consequences of aging or decrease
risk of developing dementia.

S.C. SELIGMAN, T. GIOVANNETTI, J. HULSWIT, R. DIVERS &
J. REILLY. Effects of Goal and Cognitive Load on Eye Movements
to Everyday Objects in Healthy Older Adults.
Objective: Subtle functional changes occur in normal and pathological
aging, but little is known about the nature of these changes and their
relevance to future decline. This pilot study used a novel computer task
to examine eye movements in healthy older adults while viewing everyday objects during goal-driven behavior and under variable cognitive
load. We expected more efficient fixation patterns in goal-driven viewing
with lower cognitive load.
Participants and Methods: 4 non-demented older adults (ages 67-75,
TICS>32) viewed an array of everyday objects under two instructions
manipulating goal-driven visual behaviors: 1) simply view and 2) view
while verbalizing the steps to complete an everyday task with the objects. Both conditions were completed for a simple (instant coffee) and
complex (lunch) task, designed to manipulate cognitive load. An SMI
RED-m remote eye tracker was used and proportions of fixations on
targets, distractors (e.g., razor), and white space were coded. Repeated-measures ANOVAs were conducted to examine the effects of goal
and cognitive load on fixation patterns.
Results: There was a significant effect of both goal (F>22.38, p<0.02)
and cognitive load (F>54.56, p<0.01) on target and distractor fixations,
with participants looking at target objects more often and distractor
objects less often when engaged in a goal-driven task and when cognitive load was high. There was an effect of cognitive load on fixations

174
to white space (F=10.15, p=0.05), with more fixations to white space
in the complex task.
Conclusions: Results suggest that healthy older adults fixate on targets
and away from distractors during goal-oriented object viewing. This
effect was largest for high cognitive load. However, increased cognitive
load produced vulnerability to distraction to neutral space. These initial
findings reveal reliable visual patterns on a novel task in healthy older
adults and provide preliminary support for this method. Identifying
deviations in these patterns may help improve detection of risk for
dementia.

a battery of neuropsychological tests at randomization, (day +15), and
again approximately six weeks later at study completion. Primary outcome measures included neuropsychological tests from the WMS-IV,
DKEFS in addition to CVLT-II, Trails A & B and PSAT and measures
of wakefulness and dreams.
Results: Bivariate analysis indicated no significant differences between
groups on any demographic variables. Following the two-week placebo
run in, no significant differences were found between groups on any
cognitive measure. At six weeks, significant improvement was noted
in tasks of delayed verbal recall task and executive functioning for
the Alpha BRAIN® group compared to placebo (p < .05). Analysis of
variance (ANOVA) was utilized to assess the impact of randomization
on neuropsychological outcome measures across time points. Results indicated significant interaction effects for improvement in delayed verbal
recall for the Alpha BRAIN® group.
Conclusions: The use of Alpha BRAIN® for 6-weeks significantly improved recent verbal memory when compared with controls, in a group
of healthy adults. While the outcome of the study is encouraging, this is
the first randomized controlled trial of Alpha BRAIN® and the results
merit further study.

H. SONG & J. CHEY. Fronto-parietal Network Mediates the
Education Effects on Reasoning Ability in Healthy Elderly People.
Objective: Reasoning is used to solve problems in novel situations by
finding logical relations. It declines with age which appear to be moderated by education. It was expected that variations in the connectivity
strength within a network, possibly induced by education, contribute to
individual difference in reasoning ability in older adults. In this study,
we purported to investigate how the moderating effect of education
(EOE) on reasoning ability was implemented in the brain examining
the resting state functional connectivity of major cortical networks in
aging subjects.
Participants and Methods: Thirty healthy older adults (age
m=62.7;YOE m=7.1) participated. The Perceptual Reasoning Index
score in WAIS-IV was obtained, followed by a resting state BOLD fMRI

data acquisition (6 min.) The strength of intra-network connectivity
was investigated utilizing the ICA and power spectra analysis. Mediation analysis was used to examine the EOE on reasoning ability with
temporal coherence of spontaneous activity.
Results: We found that the EOE on reasoning ability in aging adults
were statistically significant, and was mediated by the power spectra of
spontaneous activity of the right fronto-parietal regions. More specifically, right fronto-parietal network (IC 27), including middle frontal
gyrus, inferior and superior parietal lobules, posterior cingulate, and
middle temporal gyrus, showed significant mediating effect.
Conclusions: This study illustrated that fronto-parietal network temporal coherence mediate the EOE on reasoning ability in aging subjects.
It appears that greater years of education are responsible for relatively
preserved reasoning ability in healthy elderly adults possibly via greater
temporally coherent spontaneous activity in brain regions involved in
reasoning. Intra-network connectivity strength could be a neural basis
underlying education-related cognitive reserve which has protective effects against the dementias.

L. WOLFSON. Processing Speed, but Not Memory, Predicted
Attrition in a Longitudinal Study of Health Elderly.
Objective: Cognitive impairment has been associated with attrition in
longitudinal research with the elderly. The current investigation examined baseline neuropsychological functioning as a predictor of attrition
in a 4-year study of hypertension, mobility, and cognition in the healthy
elderly.
Participants and Methods: 107 adults between the ages of 75 and 90
were evaluated at baseline, two years and four years. Processing speed
was assessed using the Trail Making Test, the Repeatable Battery for the
Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS) Coding task, and the
Stroop Test. Memory was tested with three RBANS memory measures.
Results: Of the 107 who completed baseline testing, 81 received follow-up testing at 2 years (75.7%) and 58 (54.2%) completed the study.
Participants who dropped out at time 2 and 3 were compared to those
who completed the study using a one-way ANOVA. Participants tested
at time 2 performed better on Coding (p < .001); Stroop Word Reading
(p < .001) and Trails A (p = .004) than those who dropped out. Those
who completed the study performed significantly better on the Coding
and Stroop Word tasks compared to individuals who dropped out after
Time 1 or Time 2, and better on the Trails A task than those who left
the study after Time 1. There were no significant differences in verbal
memory scores at baseline between any of the groups; however, memory for the complex figure was better in the group that completed the
study (p < .02).
Conclusions: Among the healthy elderly, attrition in longitudinal studies study is related to cognitive functioning with better baseline performances in processing speed predictive of continued participation. In contrast, baseline memory scores did not predict continued participation.

Hyperintensities on Cognition in Normal Aging.
Objective: Beta-amyloid (Aβ) deposition, a key marker of Alzheimer’s
Disease (AD), and white matter hyperintensities (WMH) are believed
to contribute to cognitive decline that occurs in normal aging. The goal
of this study was to assess the impact of (Aβ) deposition and WMH on
cognitive functioning in healthy elderly adults.
Participants and Methods: Seventy-six healthy olders adults (mean =
73 years) completed a range of neuropsychological tests. Performance on
tests of episodic memory, semantic memory, working memory, executive

functions and processing speed was examined. Aβ deposition was measured using Positron emission tomography (PET) with the amyloid
tracer [11C] Pittsburgh compound B (PiB).We assessed WMH burden
using the ARWMC visual rating scale on FLAIR MRI. Linear regression
analyses were performed to assess the relationship between biomarkers
and performance scores across cognitive domains.
Results: A multiple linear regression model using WMH, SUVR values
and age as the input variables and cognitive performance as the output
variables showed a negative relationship between WMH and working
memory and mental flexibility, while PIB SUVR was negatively associated with performance on working memory and verbal episodic memory.
A forward linear regression analysis yielded an additive effect of SUVR
and WMH burden on a measure of executive control.
Conclusions: These preliminary results suggest that executive functioning and working memory are vulnerable to both amyloid burden
and WMH while episodic memory appears to be particularly vulnerable
to amyloid burden. Distinct cognitive/biomarker profiles may reflect
separate neuropathological trajectories.

J.W. TAM & M. SCHMITTER-EDGECOMBE. A Video-based
Intervention to Increase Aging Services Technologies Awareness
and Promote Functional Independence.
Objective: Research has identified lack of awareness as a primary
barrier to aging services technologies (ASTs) that can compensate for
age-related cognitive and physical changes to facilitate functional independence. This study evaluated the effectiveness of a video-based
intervention to increase AST awareness among older adults with and
without subjective medical and/or cognitive complaints (MCC).
Participants and Methods: Age, education, and gender matched individuals, age 50 and older, with MCC (N = 88) and without MCC (N =
88) completed questionnaires and a tool identification task before (T1)
and after (T2) viewing educational videos on tools to assist with memory
(e.g., talking calendars), medication management (e.g., pill boxes with
alarms), and daily living (e.g., large grip utensils). Information regarding health status, AST knowledge, attitude, stigma, as well as program
satisfaction was gathered.
Results: Group (MCC, without MCC) by condition (T1, T2) mixed
ANOVAs revealed improved tool identification task performance
post-intervention, F(1,161) = 573.83, p < .001. In addition, improved
knowledge, F(1,148) = 70.05, more positive attitudes, F(1,148) =
13.45, and lower levels of stigma, F(1,148) = 32.02, were self-reported
post-intervention (ps < .05). Individuals without MCC endorsed a significant higher level of AST knowledge than those with MCC, F(1,148)
= 3.99, p < . 05. A significant interaction, F(1,148) = 5.82, p = .02,
revealed a greater level of reduction in stigma post-intervention for
individuals without MCC (T1: M = 3.77, SD = .10; T2: M = 4.21, SD
= .09) than individuals with MCC (T1: M = 4.08, SD = .10; T2: M =
4.26, SD = .09). Participants provided positive feedback and would
recommend the intervention to others (>95%).
Conclusions: Study findings demonstrated that the video-based intervention is efficacious in improving AST outcomes. Implications for
using AST videos with patients are discussed.

K.R. THOMAS, D. BOWERS & M. MARSISKE. Complex Everyday
Task Error Types and the Association with Neuropsychological
Measures.
Objective: The goals of this study were to a) describe the type and
frequency of errors that older adults made during complex medication
management and bill paying tasks and to b) examine the relationship
between the specific error types and neuropsychological tasks.

175
Participants and Methods: Older adult participants (n=101; mean
age=80.49 years; mean education=16.07 years) were administered a
performance-based measure of complex everyday tasks and neuropsychological measures. Two of the everyday tasks—loading a pill box
and paying bills—were coded to examine three specific types of errors:
task-general (clearly has real world implications) vs. task-specific (specific to the novel instructions of the task); omission (forgot to perform)
vs. commission (incorrectly performed); critical (would result in serious
real world consequences) vs. non-critical (would not result in serious
consequences).
Results: Descriptive analyses showed that participants made an average
of 6.66 total errors and 55.4% of the sample made five or more errors
across the two tasks. On average, participants made more task-specific
than task-general errors [t(100)=-6.46, p<.001], more commission than
omission errors [t(100)=-1.92, p=.058], and more non-critical than
critical errors [t(100)=-1.72, p=.089]. Measures of working memory
(Letter-Number Sequencing, Reading Span), reasoning (Word Series),
Memory (Logical Memory, BVMT), and prospective memory (MIST)
were strongly associated (r>.5) with task-specific, commission, critical,
and non-critical error types.
Conclusions: In a highly educated sample of elders living independently, there were high error rates on the complex everyday tasks
of loading a pill box and paying bills. The high rate of task-specific
errors suggested that participants were more likely to experience failures
when tasks diverged from their routine daily experience, showing that
novelty and unfamiliarity may increase risk of everyday task failure.
Error types were strongly related to several neuropsychological domains.

J. THOMPSON & S.D. GALE. Sex Differences in Memory Decline
in Mild Cognitive Impairment and Alzheimer’s Disease.
Objective: To investigate potential sex differences longitudinally in
memory and learning in men and women with mild cognitive decline
(MCI) and Alzheimer’s disease (AD).
Participants and Methods: Seventy-five patients with a diagnosis of
MCI (n=46; males=25) or AD (n=29; males=13) and 75 healthy controls
(i.e. non-demented; males=36) were evaluated with the Rey Auditory
Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT) and the Brief Visuospatial Memory
Test-Revised (BVMT-R) at least 3 times over a five year period. Latent-growth curve modeling was used to determine whether there were
sex differences in total learning scores, delayed recall memory scores,
and diagnosis (i.e. MCI vs. AD) longitudinally.
Results: Female participants in both the AD and MCI groups tended
to start at a lower initial score, show decreased scores over time on
measures of both the RAVLT and the BVMT delayed recall trial, and
have an overall worse decline when compared to male participants with
AD (p<0.001). Female scores on total learning showed a similar path;
however, females tended to begin at a slightly higher initial score, but
showed a more rapid decline over the three epochs, ending with significantly lower scores than male counterparts (p<0.05). Therefore,
although women in the MCI and AD groups initially performed better
than the men, by the third visit, scores had dropped significantly lower
than male scores in the third epoch.
Conclusions: Sex differences over time in both total learning and delayed recall were demonstrated in the MCI and AD groups when compared with healthy controls, suggesting that, in general, women in the
clinical groups achieved lower average scores and declined more rapidly
over the 3-year interval than both the AD males and the healthy controls. Results have implications for diagnosis and treatment.

S.M. TIERNEY, R.S. BUCKS, M. WEINBORN, E. HODGSON
& S. WOODS. Retrieval Cue and Delay Interval Influence the
Relationship Between Prospective Memory and Activities of Daily
Living in Older Adults.
Objective: Older adults commonly experience mild declines in everyday functioning and the strategic aspects of prospective memory (PM).
This study used Multiprocess Theory to examine whether the strategic
demands of retrieval cue type (event- vs. time-based) and delay interval
length (2- vs. 15-minute) influence the relationship between PM and
activities of daily living (ADL) in older adults.
Participants and Methods: Participants included 97 community-dwelling older adults recruited from the Western Australia Participant Pool. Participants were administered the Memory for Intentions
Screening Test (MIST) and Prospective and Retrospective Memory
Questionnaire (PRMQ) as part of a larger neurocognitive assessment.
A knowledgeable informant completed the Activities of Daily Living
Questionnaire (ADLQ), from which a cutpoint of ≥1 was used to classify
participants into “ADL Normal” (n = 37) or “ Mild ADL Problems”
(n = 60) groups. Separate repeated-measures MANOVA controlling for
age, other cognitive functions, and negative affect were conducted with
ADL group as the between-subjects factor and either MIST or PRMQ
cue and delay scores as the within-subjects factors.
Results: Results revealed a significant ADL Group by PM interaction,
such that the Mild ADL problems group performed worse than ADL
normal participants on the 15-minute time-based scale of the MIST (p
<.001; Cohen’s d = 0.71). No other MIST or PRMQ variable differed
between the two ADL groups (ps >.10).
Conclusions: Findings indicate that decrements in strategically demanding cue monitoring and detection over longer PM delays may partly
explain older adults’ mild problems in everyday functioning. Findings
may inform neuropsychological interventions aimed at maintaining
ADL independence and enhancing quality of life in older adults.

E. TRIFILIO, L.C. BUTTERFIELD, P. MANGAL, K.R. THOMAS,
J. JONES, M. MARSISKE & D. BOWERS. Cognitive Correlates of
Consummatory vs. Anticipatory Anhedonia in Older Adults.
Objective: Anhedonia comprises two components: consummatory anhedonia, the inability to experience pleasure directly, and anticipatory
anhedonia, the inability to look forward to pleasure. Behavioral and imaging studies suggest each is associated with distinct neural circuitriesconsummatory with limbic (i.e. nucleus accumbens, ventral pallidum,
hippocampus, amygdala) and anticipatory with frontal (i.e. dorsolateral
prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate, insula) regions. Few studies have
examined the relationship between anhedonia and neurocognition in
older adults based on presumed neural circuitry of each component.
In this study, we tested that hypothesis that anticipatory anhedonia
would associate with poorer executive function whereas consummatory
anhedonia would associate with poorer recent memory.
Participants and Methods: 80 nondemented independent living
older adults (mean age: 78, range: 60-93) completed questionnaires,
including the Temporal Experience of Pleasure Scale (TEPS), and a
multi-domain battery of neuropsychological tests. Linear regressions
were conducted, controlling for age.
Results: Consummatory anhedonia negatively predicted both immediate (β= -0.227, R2= 0.052, p= 0.061) and delayed memory (β= -0.344,
R2= 0.086, p= 0.015) composites when controlling for age. No relationship was found between anticipatory anhedonia and executive function
or attention/working memory composites.
Conclusions: We found partial support for our hypothesis, namely
worse memory was associated with greater consummatory anhedonia.
The lack of relationship between anticipatory anhedonia and executive
function may be due to aspects of measurement. Future analyses may
consider using executive tasks more sensitive to DLPFC functioning
(i.e. gambling tasks) and physiological measures of anhedonia (e.g.

EEG, SCR). Consummatory and anticipatory anhedonia appear to be
differentially related to cognitive outcomes.

Neuroimaging Source Memory in Aging: Putting the Context
Memory Deficit in Context.
Objective: Normal aging commonly results in diminished memory
functioning for contextual details of events and experiences (source
memory; SM). Previous work has postulated that observed SM deficits
in aging result from either a generalized reduction of cognitive resources,
a specific problem in encoding contextual representations (“binding”),
or both. However, because binding itself relies on multiple functional
systems, the functional neuroanatomy of age-related SM decline remains
unclear. To more completely capture this phenomenon, we investigated
differences in both regional fMRI activation and network connectivity
during SM retrieval between young and older adults.
Participants and Methods: Fourteen young and 14 older adults (YA,
OA) underwent fMRI while completing an event-related behavioral paradigm for encoding and retrieving faces and scenes (item conditions),
and face-scene pairs (source condition). For our purposes, only retrieval
trials were examined. Data were analyzed in SPM8, where within-group
activation contrasts were created for source vs. item trials and compared
between groups. Retrieval-modulated functional connectivity was examined using the generalized psychophysiological interaction (gPPI)
toolbox (McLaren et al., 2012).
Results: Reduced parahippocampal activation but increased fronto-parieto-occipital activation (most prominently in the precuneus) was observed in OAs compared to YAs, supporting a specific context memory
deficit and the adoption of a less specialized neural strategy in OAs.
Paradoxically, OAs demonstrated reduced task-modulated connectivity
between the precuneus and the rest of the brain, but increased connectivity between the parahippocampal gyrus and key regions of the
default network.
Conclusions: Findings highlight the potential consequences of localized
functional compromise on network functioning in aging, and underscore the importance of examining altered activation and connectivity
patterns conjointly in the functional neuroimaging of age-related SM
deficits.

L.C. WALZAK & W.L. THORNTON. Investigating Illness Burden
as a Risk Factor for Cognitive and Affective Theory of Mind in Older
Adults.
Objective: Theory of Mind (ToM) is the ability to reason about mental
states in order to understand and predict behavior. Past research has
identified strong links between increased pulse pressure, a measure of
vascular health, and reduced ToM in older adults. Furthermore, past
findings suggest that cognitive ToM is particularly vulnerable to increased pulse pressure. However, to date, the relationship between other
health risks and reduced ToM is unknown. We aimed to investigate
the effects of vascular and nonvascular illness burden on ToM in older
adults.
Participants and Methods: 85 older adults (59 females; 26 males, M
= 72 years) completed measures of verbal knowledge, affective ToM
(Reading the Eyes in the Mind task and YONI-A) and cognitive ToM
(Strange Stories task and YONI-C). Participants also completed an
inventory of vascular conditions (hypertension, type II diabetes, high
cholesterol, stroke, heart attack) and nonvascular conditions (osteoporosis, osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, thyroid dysfunction). Illnesses
were indexed with standardized beta weights obtained through linear

regression and summed to create overall illness burden scores. that were
entered into separate regression models.
Results: Greater severity of vascular illness burden was associated with
poorer cognitive ToM (β = -.26, 95% CI = [-1.90, -.25], p <.01), but not
affective ToM (β = -.12, 95% CI = [-2.28, .51], p = .21) after controlling
for language ability, age and gender. Nonvascular illness burden did not
predict cognitive or affective ToM.
Conclusions: Our findings highlight the specific importance of considering vascular health as a risk factor for declines in ToM in later
life. Further elucidation of how illness burden differentially impacts
cognitive and affective ToM will be valuable in developing effective
interventions for older adults. Given the high prevalence of vascular
illness in later life, these findings underscore the need to determine the
clinical relevance of social cognitive skills in older adults.

A.B. WATERS, A. MACKAY-BRANDT & S.A. BEAUDREAU. The
Relationship Between Worry and Executive Functioning in Older
Adults.
Objective: Evidence suggests that anxiety predicts cognitive impairment or decline (Beaudreau, & O’Hara, 2008). Less is known, however,
regarding the role of worry on cognition. Elevated anxiety and poorer
executive functioning are consistently correlated (Beaudreau, MacKay,
& Reynolds, 2013), but relations between worry and executive functioning are less clear. The goal of this study was to examine whether
worry severity predicted executive functioning performance in community-residing older adults. We hypothesized that, similar to anxiety,
elevated worry would be associated with poorer executive functioning.
Participants and Methods: Participants 60 to 85 years old (N = 127)
completed the Older Adult Self-Report measure (OASR). Worry was
measured by the OASR Worries subscale. Participants also completed
a neuropychological battery from which composite scores for executive
functioning and simple motor speed were generated.
Results: More worry was significantly correlated with lower executive
functioning (r=-.21, p<.01). In a multiple linear regression, worries
significantly accounted variance in executive functioning after adjusting
for age, sex, highest grade completed, and motor speed, (β=-.18 p<.05,
R2=.13). We then split the sample into young-old (60-72 years, n =
64) or older-old (68-85 years, n = 63) age groups and analyzed them
separately. This association remained significant in the young-old group
(β=-.33 p<.01, R2=.33), but was no longer significant in the older-old
group.
Conclusions: Findings suggest that worry has a potentially negative
impact on executive functioning, but only in young-old adults. Though
speculative, it is possible that the cumulative effect of age-related declines in executive functioning may wash out associations with worry
in older-old individuals.

Computerized Speed Training Reduces Falls in Older Adults.
Objective: Falls among older adults are very dangerous as the consequences of falls range from mild orthopedic injuries to severe traumatic
brain injuries that are irreversible. Cognitive impairment is a risk factor
for falls. The relationship between cognitive functioning and falls may be
due to gait utilizing/relying on certain aspects of cognition (such as processing speed). The study objective was to determine if cognitive training
for speed of visual processing reduces risks for falls in older adults.
Participants and Methods: These analyses utilized data from the ACTIVE randomized controlled trial of 10-weeks of cognitive training in

177
three areas (logical reasoning, memory, and speed of visual processing).
We assessed the impact of training on the number of falls reported in
the two months preceding the baseline (pre-training) and at 1-year
follow-up. Comparisons were restricted to speed trained group (n = 335)
vs. control (n = 695), because randomization failed to return groups
with comparable self-reported history of falls at baseline for reasoning
trained and memory trained groups with control group (p < .001).
Negative binomial regressions were used to assess for differences in rates
of falls between groups at 1 year post training/baseline.
Results: The falls rate in the control group was 0.45 at baseline and
0.47 at 1-year follow-up (p > .05). However, in the speed trained group,
there was a significant reduction in falls rate from 0.45 at baseline to
0.17 at 1-year follow-up (β = 0.45, p < .001).
Conclusions: The findings of this study demonstrate that speed of visual processing training reduces risks of falls in older adults 1 year post
training to about half the risk of those without training (control group).
This study adds to the to the literature support of a computerized cognitive training module to produce robust benefits in safety of older adults.

Cognitive Complaints Are Associated with Depressive Symptoms
and Not with Concurrent Cognitive Performance in A Clinic-Based
Sample of Older Adults.
Objective: Complaints of cognitive decline are common in older individuals and have been associated with neurodegeneration; however, the
association between subjective cognitive decline (SCD) and concurrent
objective cognitive performance remains unclear. Previous research
showed that SCD was related to symptoms of depression and not to
objective cognitive decline in a randomly-selected sample of older adults.
However, the association between SCD and objective cognitive performance in clinic-based samples remains unknown.
Participants and Methods: The current study examined cognitive
screen data and Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) scores from 586 adults
between the ages of 60 and 95 (mean age=76, mean education=15 years,
59% women) who were referred by community health clinics for screening of possible cognitive impairment. Individuals with frank dementia
were excluded (MMSE <24). A cognitive composite was created based
on performance on the Trail Making Test, WMS Logical Memory, Clock
Drawing Test, and Animal Fluency.
Results: Multiple linear regression analyses indicated that SCDs did not
predict cognitive composite scores after correcting for age, education,
and depressive symptoms (B=.028, β=.056, p=.164). In contrast, scores
on the BDI were significantly associated with SCD after adjusting for
age, education, and cognitive performance (B=.057, β =.327, p=.001).
Conclusions: These results are consistent with those from a community-based, random sample and extend them to show that SCDs do not
accurately reflect current cognitive status in a clinic-based sample. Thus,
depressive symptoms represent one factor that needs to be taken into
consideration when interpreting cognitive test scores in individuals with
SCD. Future studies should investigate if SCD predicts cognitive performance and neural degeneration over time after controlling for the effects
of depressive symptoms and explore which other factors may contribute
to SCD (i.e., medical illness and medications with cognitive side effects).

MCI (Mild Cognitive Impairment)
L. ACOSTA, D. LIU, L. SAMUELS, K. GIFFORD, L. LOGAN,
K.M. WISNIEWSKI, M. WIGGINS & A.L. JEFFERSON. Error
in Category Fluency Among Individuals with Mild Cognitive
Impairment: The Vanderbilt Memory & Aging Project.
Objective: Animal Naming is a popular category fluency tool assessing
semantic knowledge. In dementia, category fluency errors increase. We
researched if Animal Fluency errors were associated with mild cognitive
impairment (MCI), namely total errors and the mean distance (number
of intervening responses) between repetition errors.
Participants and Methods: Participants were from the Vanderbilt
Memory & Aging Project, a case-control longitudinal study investigating
vascular health and brain aging. Participants were diagnosed as cognitively normal (NC, n=166, 73±7 years, 40% female) or MCI (n=168,
73±7 years, 42% female) via consensus conference. Clinicians further
subdivided MCI participants into 3 severity subtypes: mild (n=48, 73±7
years, 40% female), moderate (n=100, 72±7 years, 42% female), and
severe (n=20, 79±8 years, 45% female). Wilcoxon rank sum tests compared NC and MCI in correct animals generated (output), errors, and
mean distance between repetition errors; the same measures were compared in the 3 MCI severity subtypes using Kruskal-Wallis tests.
Results: Output was lower in MCI (17±5) than NC (21±5, p<0.001).
There was no between-group difference in errors (NC 0.9±1.2, MCI
0.9±1.2, p=0.97) or distance between repetition errors (NC 8.1±5.2,
MCI 6.8±3.8, p=0.23). Comparing MCI severity subtypes, output differed (mild 19.5±4.5, moderate 16.6±4.4, severe 11.2±4.6, p<0.001)
but not errors (mild 0.9±1.5, moderate 0.9±1.2, severe 1±0.9, p=0.29).
Mean distance between repetition errors was shorter with increasing severity of MCI (mild 8.1±3.7, moderate 6.9±3.7, severe 4.7±3.3, p=0.04).
Conclusions: While errors did not distinguish NC and MCI or MCI subtypes, among MCI participants who committed errors, mean distance between repetition errors was associated with MCI severity. Consideration
of the mean number of intervening responses between repetition errors
may be predictive of worse MCI status relative to normal cognition.

M.F. WEINER & L.H. LACRITZ. Use of Cognitive Complaint
and the Montreal Cognitive Assessment to Predict Future Mild
Cognitive Impairment.
Objective: To examine the ability of self-reported cognitive complaint
and the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) to predict future mild
cognitive impairment (MCI).
Participants and Methods: The sample included 139 [M age = 66.81
(5.09) years, range: 58-77; M educ = 14.50 (2.90) years, range: 7-20]
individuals from a larger population-based cardiovascular health study
subsequently followed at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center Alzheimer’s Disease Center (ADC). At baseline, participants
were asked if they had a cognitive complaint (executive function and/
or memory problem), and administered the MoCA. Cognitive diagnosis
at baseline was not determined. At follow-up [M = 3.54 (.62) years,
range: 2.19-4.94], 64 (46%) participants were deemed cognitively normal, and 75 (54%) were classified as MCI by ADC consensus diagnosis,
based on history, neurological exam, and in-depth cognitive assessment
(excluding MoCA performance). Separate logistic regression analyses
were performed to examine whether self-reported cognitive complaint
and total MoCA score at baseline significantly predicted (α = .05) MCI
at follow-up, controlling for age, education, and gender (α = .15).
Results: Self-reported cognitive complaint (endorsed by 17.2% of participants) did not predict diagnosis at follow-up (p = .56). However,
baseline MoCA score [M = 24.62 (3.18)] significantly predicted MCI at
follow-up [χ-square (2) = 44.69, p < .001; Nagelkerke R-square = .37]
with a correct classification rate of 73.4%, controlling for age.

Conclusions: These results provide support for the MoCA, but not
self-reported cognitive complaint, in predicting future MCI diagnosis. While the MoCA has been previously validated as a useful tool for
discriminating between cognitively normal individuals and those with
MCI, this is the first study to our knowledge examining the ability of
the MoCA to predict future cognitive diagnosis. Additional studies are
needed to further explore the utility of the MoCA as a predictor of future
neuropsychological impairment.

Empirically-Derived MCI Subtypes Show Distinct Patterns of
Cortical Atrophy Not Captured By Conventional Diagnostic
Criteria.
Objective: Previous research has demonstrated heterogeneity in neuropsychological performance and biomarker profiles within MCI samples. We previously identified four empirically-derived MCI subtypes
within the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) MCI
cohort: amnestic MCI, dysnomic MCI, dysexecutive/mixed MCI, and a
large cluster-derived normal group (34%) that was characterized by
intact neuropsychological performance (despite their MCI diagnosis).
The current study investigated cortical thickness profiles in these four
cognitive subtypes.
Participants and Methods: Cortical thickness estimates for 663 ADNI
participants (485 MCI and 178 normal controls) were computed for 32
regions of interest per hemisphere. Statistical group maps compared
each subtype to normal control participants.
Results: A unique pattern of cortical thinning was observed for each
MCI subtype, which corresponded to their profile of cognitive dysfunction. Consistent with their isolated deficit in memory, the amnestic MCI
group showed thinning in medial temporal lobe regions bilaterally. The
dysnomic MCI group demonstrated lateral temporal lobe atrophy, with
greater involvement of the left hemisphere, consistent with their naming
deficit. The dysexecutive/mixed MCI group exhibited a fairly widespread
pattern of atrophy; this reflects their neuropsychological profile, which
was characterized by poor performance across multiple cognitive domains. No differences were found between the cluster-derived normal
subtype and the normal control group.
Conclusions: There is substantial variability in cortical atrophy patterns among patients with MCI that underlie their distinct cognitive
profiles. This heterogeneity is not captured when patients are grouped
by conventional diagnostic criteria. Findings further validate our empirically-derived MCI subtypes and offer support for the premise that
the conventional diagnostic criteria for MCI are highly susceptible to
false-positive diagnostic errors.

J. EPPIG, E.C. EDMONDS, L.M. CAMPBELL, M. SANDERSONCIMINO, L. DELANO-WOOD & M.W. BONDI. Statistically-Derived
Subtypes in MCI: A Latent Profile Analysis.
Objective: Recent research has demonstrated heterogeneous neuropsychological profiles among individuals with Mild Cognitive Impairment
(MCI). However, few studies have included visuospatial functioning or
used recent advances in latent mixture modeling to statistically identify
MCI subtypes. Therefore, the current study investigated unique patterns
of neuropsychological impairment across four major cognitive domains
in MCI using Latent Profile Analysis (LPA).
Participants and Methods: 806 subjects diagnosed via ADNI MCI
criteria received a neuropsychological battery. Test scores representing domains of visuospatial ability, language, executive functions, and

Forty Fourth Annual INS Meeting Abstracts
episodic memory were adjusted for demographic characteristics using
standardized regression coefficients based on the performance of “robust” normal control participants (n= 260). Calculated z-scores were
subsequently used in the LPA, and CSF-derived biomarkers were evaluated within each MCI subgroup.
Results: Model fit indices and likelihood ratio testing revealed a 3-class
LPA was significantly better than a 2-class solution, while 4-classes was
suggestive of possible over-fitting of the data. The 3-class LPA consisted
of a mild-to-moderately impaired mixed class (n= 106), a purely amnestic class (n= 455), and a cognitively normal class (n= 245). Additionally,
the amnestic and mixed classes were more likely to be APOE e4+, have
lower ABeta1-42, higher tau, p-tau181, and p-tau181/ABeta1-42 ratios
than LPA-derived normal subjects, whom did not statistically differ
from the ‘robust’ normal controls across biomarkers.
Conclusions: This study further supports the notion of heterogeneous
neuropsychological profiles in MCI samples. Consistent with previous
work, a large minority of MCI individuals (30%) appear to represent
“false-positives” that are statistically similar to ‘robust’ normal controls. Future research should employ latent mixture modeling to exhibit
unique, longitudinal neuropsychological profiles in conjunction with
biomarker, genetic, and imaging outcomes.

D. FARRAR, M. MOSS & R. KILLIANY. Structural Network
Differences in Individuals with High versus Low Executive Abilities
in Mild Cognitive Impairment.
Objective: To determine if individuals with the amnestic form of Mild
Cognitive impairment classified as having low or high executive abilities
show differences in structural brain network connectivity.
Participants and Methods: From the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative database, 15 subjects classified as high executive functioning (aMCI-highEF) with an EF score > .91 and 17 subjects classified as
low executive functioning (aMCI-lowEF) with an EF score < -0.61 were
selected. Criteria included a diagnosis of aMCI (CDR score=0.5) and
performance of a diffusion tensor imaging scan. Networks of 93 regions
of interest were constructed, and network measures including network
size, node degree, clustering coefficient, and local efficiency were calculated for each group. In addition, measurements of the major white
matter tracts of the brain were performed in both groups. Non-parametric permutation testing was performed to assess significance.
Results: aMCI-highEF subjects showed network measures indicating
greater nonspecific connectivity, including increased network size,
greater node degree of many regions of interest, increased clustering
coefficient of various ROIs and greater global efficiency. aMCI-highEF
individuals also had greater white matter volume and higher fractional
anisotropy of a number of white matter tracts, while aMCI-lowEF individuals had greater radial diffusivity of a number of white matter tracts.
Conclusions: These differences in network parameters appear to reflect
greater white matter integrity and more efficient processing in individuals with aMCI-highEF than those with aMCI-lowEF.

A.T. FLOWERS, S. MICHEL, L. APOSTOLOVA, E. WOO,
J. RINGMAN, P. LU & J. RAZANI. Neuropsychological Tests and
Functional Ability.
Objective: Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) represents cognitive impairment beyond that observed in normal aging, and in many cases
precedes the onset of dementia. Nonetheless, little research has been
conducted to determine if commonly used neuropsychological tests can
predict functional ability. The purpose of this study was to determine
how well standard neuropsychological measures of attention, language,

179
memory, and executive functioning predict aspects of functional ability
in MCI.
Participants and Methods: 46 individuals recruited from medical centers in the Greater Los Angeles area diagnosed with MCI according to
the Petersen et al., (2001) research criteria served as participants. They
were administered the following neuropsychological tests: Digit Span,
phonemic verbal fluency (FAS category; animals), CVLT-II free-delay,
Rey-O copy, and The Wisconsin Card Sorting Test; (WCST). They were
also administered the Direct Assessment of Functional Status (DAFS),
an observation-based functional test which assesses domains of orientation, communication, transportation, finance, and shopping.
Results: Stepwise regression, was conducted to evaluate which neuropsychological tests best predicted these 5 areas of functional ability.
Results indicated that CVLT-free delay was the single best predictor of
DAFS orientation (accounting for 45% of the variability). Rey-O Copy
was the single best predictor of DAFS transportation (accounting for
64% of variability). Rey-O Copy, followed by Digit Span, were the two
best predictors of DAFS finance performance, (accounting for 91% of
the variability). WCST total errors were the single best predictor of
DAFS shopping (accounting for 50% of the variability). Lastly, no single
neuropsychological measure predicted DAFS communication.
Conclusions: Overall, these results suggest that specific cognitive domains best predict areas of functioning in MCI individuals. Furthermore,
neuropsychological tests may be useful for understanding functional
ability in MCI.

T. GIOVANNETTI, I. LAWRENCE, S.C. SELIGMAN, D.J. LIBON,
E. ROLL, B.L. DECK, J. KURCZEWSKI & E. SCHELL. Subtypes
of Functional Impairment in People with MCI.
Objective: Distinct performance patterns have been reported on everyday tasks in dementia; some show a tendency to omit major task steps
whereas others complete most steps, but do so inaccurately. This study
examined functional performance patterns in MCI.
Participants and Methods: Participants with MCI (n = 24) and healthy
elderly (n = 6) were videotaped as they performed everyday tasks. Errors
were identified and classified as Omission, Commission, or Microerror
(e.g., subtle commissions that are immediately corrected). Total errors
and error distributions (i.e. proportion of each error type out of total
errors) were compared across groups and correlated with cognitive tests
(MMSE, episodic/working memory, language).
Results: MCI participants committed twice as many errors as controls.
Differences were significant for Omissions (p <.01, d = .98), but did
not reach statistical significance for Commissions (p = .09, d = .69)
or Microerrors (p =.08, d = .67). Controls’ error distributions showed
large proportions of Microerrors (71%) and Commissions (27%) but
few Omissions (2%). A subset of MCI participants (n = 7; 30%) showed
distinct error distributions, with Omission proportions +1.5 SD greater
than controls (e.g., 54% Microerrors; 17% Commissions; 29% Omissions). The remaining MCI participants’ (70%) error distributions were
nearly identical to controls, but they made more errors than controls (p
= .05, d = .91). Correlations with cognitive tests showed Microerrors/
Omissions were associated with episodic memory (r > -.38, p < .03
for all).
Conclusions: Similar to past dementia research, MCI participants
showed meaningful differences in functional performance patterns.
Some showed a qualitatively different error pattern than controls (e.g.,
omitters); others showed a qualitatively similar error pattern but more
total errors than controls (e.g., committers). Correlation analyses suggest MCI functional deficit patterns may be attributed to different cognitive mechanisms.

Philadelphia (repeatable) Verbal Learning Test in non-demented
older adults: The Vanderbilt Memory & Aging Project.
Objective: The Philadelphia (repeatable) Verbal Learning Test (PrVLT)
is a serial list learning test developed to assess episodic memory in older
adults. The 9-word PrVLT has been shown to differentiate performance
between cognitive normal (NC) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI).
The current study assessed performance on the 12-word PrVLT across
learning, recall, and recognition trials between NC and MCI.
Participants and Methods: Participants were drawn from the Vanderbilt Memory & Aging Project, a case-control longitudinal study investigating vascular health and brain aging. At enrollment, NC participants
(n=163, 73±7 years, 31% female) and MCI participants (n=165, 73±8
years, 31% female) completed the PrVLT. PrVLT was not used to determine diagnostic status. Wilcoxon tests assessed for PrVLT performance
differences between NC and MCI.
Results: NC performed better on PrVLT learning trials (Trials 1-5),
total learning, immediate free and cued recall, delayed free and cued
recall, and recognition (all p-values<0.001) compared to MCI. MCI individuals endorsed more semantically related words and List B foils during
recognition than NC (p<0.001). NC individuals demonstrated less intrusions overall (p-values<0.04) and less List B intrusions (p<0.001)
compared to MCI. MCI individuals were more likely to intrude List A
words during List B recall (p>0.001). MCI participants evidenced a
larger recency effect than NC (p<0.001) whereas NC individuals evidenced more responses from the middle of the list than MCI (p<0.001).
Conclusions: NC performed better than MCI on multiple aspects of
the PrVLT. Performance patterns in MCI suggested impairment with
encoding and source memory. Results highlight the clinical utility of
this measure for early identification of a memory disorder. Further
validation of this measure is needed with longitudinal studies and work
linking PrVLT performance with biomarkers of unhealthy brain aging.

the MyCog and TheirCog scores could differentiate MCI and AD from

Conclusions: These results indicated that the TheirCog is a more reliable measure of subjects’ cognitive states, while the MyCog is more
associated with psychological factors such as depression.

K. KAUZOR. Daily Functioning in MCI Patients With and Without
Caregivers.
Objective: Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a diagnostic construct
characterized by cognitive deficits in the absence of general intellectual
or functional decline. MCI often represents a prodromal state between
normal aging and dementia. The purpose of this study was to characterize the performance of MCI individuals with and without caregivers
on an observation-based, activities of daily living test
Participants and Methods: A total of 46 MCI participants were included in this study, of which, 18 had caregivers and 28 did not. All
participants were administered the Direct Assessment of Functional
Status (DAFS), as part of a larger test battery.
Results: Mann-Whitney U Tests were used to determine if a difference
in performance on the DAFS could be determined, depending upon
whether or not the individual had a caregiver. The analysis revealed significant differences in performance on 3 sub-scales of the DAFS, Orientation to Date, U=182.000, p=.040, Shopping Free Recall, U=116.000,
p=.020, and Shopping Recognition, U=111.000, p=.013. On these 3
sub-scales, MCI participants with a caregiver performed significantly
worse than those without.
Conclusions: Our results indicate that individuals with mild cognitive
impairment who have designated caregivers, as opposed to those who
do not, have poorer daily functioning on tasks which depend on memory
(such as shopping).

J. PARK, B. KIM, M. SONG & Y. KANG. A Validity Study of the
Korean-Subjective Cognitive Decline Questionnaire (K-SCD-Q).
Objective: The Subjective Cognitive Decline Questionnaire was developed as a screening tool for the perceived subjective cognitive decline
over the last two years (Rami et al., 2014). This study was conducted
to examine the validity of the Korean version of Subjective Cognitive
Decline Questionnaire (K-SCD-Q).
Participants and Methods: We administered the K-SCD-Q to 268
healthy normal elderly (NE), 133 amnestic MCI, 76 mild AD, and their
informants (n=477). All the subjects were given the MMSE, MoCA,
and Geriatric Depression Scale. The Seoul Neuropsychological Screening Battery (SNSB) was also administered to the MCI and AD. The
K-SCD-Q consisted of subject rating (MyCog) and informant rating
(TheirCog).
Results: Both the MCI and AD scored higher than NE in the MyCog as
well as TheirCog. Although there was no difference between the MCI
and AD in the MyCog, the AD showed significantly higher scores in
TheirCog than the MCI. Significant correlations between the MyCog
and TheirCog scores were found in NE (r=.49, p<.001) and AD (r=.45,
p<.001) but not in MCI. The MyCog scores of all groups correlated
significantly with depression level (r=.50, .37, .47, p<.001). Only the
NE showed a significant correlation between the MyCog score and age
(r=.20, p<.01). The MyCog scores of three groups did not show any
correlations with the MMSE and MoCA after controlling depression
level and age as covariates. Unlike the MyCog, only the NE showed a
significant correlation between the TheirCog score and depression level
(r=.33, p<.001). The TheirCog scores of MCI and AD correlated significantly with memory (r=-.32, p<.001) and language (r=-.18, p<.05)

J. GAIR, L. SHABO & B.C. LUST. Interdisciplinary Studies Begin to
Reveal Language Deficit in Prodromal AD and to Predict Corollary
Neural Degeneration in Brain Network Connectivity.
Objective: We seek to identify linguistic deficits in prodromal Alzheimer’s disease to determine if this can contribute to disease detection
before clinical manifestation. We investigate whether such linguistic
deficits can be linked to potential biomarkers such as provided by structural MRI.
Participants and Methods: We combined interdisciplinary cross-institutional expertise in linguistic, psycholinguistic, experimental and
clinical neuropsychology to test 3 groups- MCI (N=21), age matched
Healthy Aging (HA) (N=24) and Healthy Young (HY) (N=10) on elicited imitation of 3 complex sentence types which varied in syntactic and
semantic factors. Standardized administration and behavioral coding
provided data analyzed by logistic-linear mixed models. Pilot investigation of brain MRIs from 5 MCI subjects were analyzed by Voxel Based
Morphometry and compared to 18 HA matched scans (ADNI) with
regard to grey matter integrity in a multivariate mixed model which
included ROI for proportion of grey matter for Inferior Parietal Lobe
(IPL) and Broca’s Area (BA) relative to a HA template.
Results: Comparison of language production behaviors across all 3 sentence types revealed (i) significant deficit in MCI compared to HA and
HY; (ii) the source of this deficit as particular to linguistic phenomena,
viz., involving an interface between syntax and semantics while sparing
syntax per se. Initial brain scan analyses revealed (iii) greater mean
difference between IPL (Default Network connectivity hub) and BA
(syntax related) neurodegeneration in MCI than HA scans, lower IPL

Forty Fourth Annual INS Meeting Abstracts
integrity in MCI than HA and similar BA integrity between MCI and
HA. Regressions of syntactic performance on ROI IPL were stronger for
structures requiring reference resolution.
Conclusions: Results support current structural and functional models of language knowledge and processing, and neurodegeneration in
progressive development of AD. They argue for the feasibility of a new
interdisciplinary methodology for brain-behavior analyses in the area
of language.

N. MAHENDRA & M. IFAH. Effects of Mild Cognitive Impairment
on Linguistic Communication.
Objective: Mild cognitive impairment -MCI is a nosological entity
thought to be a prodrome of dementia. As distinct types of MCI have
been identified, it is recognized that other cognitive functions besides
memory also are impaired. Linguistic communication measures are
important cognitive biomarkers. Our objective was to study the performance of persons with MCI on a standardized language battery. Our
secondary objective was to identify which language tasks have greater
clinical utility in identifying and quantifying MCI.
Participants and Methods: After obtaining informed consent, we assessed 10 persons with MCI and compared their performance to healthy
young and older controls as well as published norms for persons diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease. Participants’ medical history was
obtained; hearing, vision and affect screened; cognitive function assessed
and a standardized language battery administered- the Arizona Battery
for Communication Disorders of Dementia (ABCD; Bayles & Tomoeda,
1993). This test has been validated for distinguishing between the linguistic communication profile of healthy controls (young and old) and
persons with AD.
Results: Performance of persons with MCI was documented on 14 subtests of linguistic communication, mapping onto 5 constructs of Mental
Status, Memory, Language Expression, Language Comprehension and
Visuospatial Construction.
Conclusions: Our results demonstrated that linguistic communication
tasks that require episodic recollection (e.g. word learning, story recall),
and more generative and narrative responses on discourse tasks (e.g.
tasks requiring object description and concept definition) were especially sensitive to language changes accompanying MCI. Simpler tasks
of linguistic communication (e.g. reading comprehension of words and
sentences; confrontation naming) did not reveal any differences from
healthy older controls. Implications of these results for clinical assessment in MCI will be discussed.

Efficiency and Memory Decay in Older Adults with amnestic MCI.
Objective: We examined the relationship between cardiorespiratory
fitness and cognition in older adults with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI).
Participants and Methods: Fifty-six men and women aged 55–88
years with aMCI underwent cardiorespiratory exercise testing and neuropsychological assessment.
Results: Lower cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) was significantly associated with memory decay but not working memory. Ventilatory efficiency
was a stronger predictor of better memory performance than maximal
oxygen uptake. Participants with lower CRF forgot approximately 70%
more information than individuals with higher CRF. Furthermore, those
with lower CRF were 12x more likely to fall in the “High Memory Loss”
group compared to those with higher CRF.
Conclusions: Results reveal that CRF is significantly associated with
memory retention in older adults with aMCI. Additionally, results

181
suggest that ventilatory efficiency is a stronger predictor of memory
performance than maximal oxygen uptake, which has long been considered the gold standard exercise outcome variable.

J. NOVITSKI & M. SEIDENBERG. Autobiographical and Spatial
Fluency in Healthy Older Adults and Mild Cognitive Impairment.
Objective: Recent fMRI findings report increased medial temporal lobe
(MTL) activation for semantic fluency performance for categories that
engage spatial (e.g. items in your living room) or autobiographical features (e.g., television shows you’ve watched) (Sheldon & Moscovitch,
2011; Greenberg et al., 2009; Ryan et al., 2008). This study examined
performance of healthy control (HC) and Mild Cognitive Impairment
(MCI) groups on three semantic fluency categories: autobiographical
(books/magazines you read, movies you saw, television shows you
watched), spatial (items in your living room, bedroom, and kitchen),
and non-episodic (animals, fruits and vegetables, musical instruments).
Based on the recent fMRI findings, we expected to see greater impairment in the MCI group for the spatial and autobiographical categories
than for non-episodic categories.
Participants and Methods: Forty-four participants, 27 healthy controls (mean age = 78, education = 15 years) and 17 individuals with
MCI or mild Alzheimer’s disease (mean age = 81, education = 15 years)
were recruited for this study. All participants were given 60 seconds to
generate items from three different categories of semantic fluency. A 2
x 3 repeated measures ANOVA was used to assess group differences by
fluency category, and independent samples t-tests were used to compare
group performances for each category.
Results: The MCI group produced less total words than the HC group
for all three semantic categories. In addition, non-episodic fluency performance proved to be the strongest predictor distinguishing the HC
and MCI groups, followed by spatial fluency; autobiographical fluency
showed the least group discrimination.
Conclusions: Our findings are not consistent with the proposal that
spatial and autobiographical features of a semantic fluency category
are more disrupted in MCI, typically characterized with MTL damage.
Potential reasons for these findings are discussed.

D. PUTCHA & G. TREMONT. Neuropsychological Predictors
of Instrumental Activities of Daily Living in Mild Cognitive
Impairment.
Objective: Individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) demonstrate deficits in instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) that place
them at higher risk of functional decline. This study aims to determine whether screening tools known to predict IADL dysfunction in
healthy control (Hopkins Verbal Learning Test-R) and dementia groups
(MMSE, DRS-2) are also useful in MCI.
Participants and Methods: Seventy individuals diagnosed with amnestic plus MCI (mean age = 72.9, 39 F, MMSE = 26.3) and 59 individuals diagnosed with dementia (mean age = 73.8, 37 F, MMSE
= 24.2) were evaluated on a standard neuropsychological assessment
battery. Controlling for age and education, we investigated the ability of
performance on the MMSE and HVLT-R to predict IADL dysfunction,
as defined by informant-report on the Lawton-Brody IADL scale, in
each group separately.
Results: MMSE performance was related to IADL independence in the
dementia group (r=0.42, p=0.001) but not in MCI (p>0.9). In contrast,
list learning (HVLT-R) significantly predicted IADL dysfunction in MCI
individuals (r= 0.33, p=0.005), but not in dementia (p=0.07). DRS-2
performance predicted IADL functions in both groups (MCI: r=0.36,
p=0.003; AD: r=0.32, p=0.02).

182
Conclusions: These results suggest that neuropsychological predictors
of IADLs differ between individuals with MCI and dementia. Performance on the HVLT-R can be informative to clinicians in assessing
functional independence in MCI individuals, rather than relying solely
on screening measures, which are more predictive in dementia groups.
Future work should investigate if these measures can predict change in
IADL function over time.

Mild Cognitive Impairment is Prevalent in Persons with Severe
Obesity.
Objective: Severe obesity (BMI≥35) is prevalent in the U.S. and is associated with an increased risk for cognitive impairment. However, the
prevalence of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) has not been examined
in a severely obese sample. This study did so and examined possible
changes in cognitive function in a subset of patients that underwent
bariatric surgery.
Participants and Methods: A total of 166 adults (43±11.10 years,
range=20-68; BMI=44.54±6.47; 79.5% female) completed medical
history questionnaires, computerized Integneuro cognitive testing, and
subjective ratings of cognitive difficulties. A subset of the participants
(n=99) underwent bariatric surgery as part of a larger project and were
re-assessed 12 months post-surgery. Objective cognitive decline was
established using the comprehensive criteria for MCI established by
Jak and colleagues (≥1 SD below the normative mean on 2+ tasks in a
cognitive domain).
Results: MCI was found in a majority of participants (53%) and prevalent even in young and middle-aged participants (age 19-29=47%). In
the bariatric surgery subset, MCI prevalence was reduced from 51.5%
at baseline to 24.2% at the 12-month follow-up. When comparing the
subset of surgery patients that saw a resolution in MCI from pre- to
post-surgery to those that did not, no differences in resolution rates were
found for hypertension [χ2(5)=7.2, p=.20], sleep apnea [χ2(4)=2.1,
p=.71], or diabetes [χ2(4)=.7, p=.94]. The groups also did not differ
in age [t(49)=.5, p=.62], BMI at baseline [t(49)=-1.0, p=.32], or BMI
change from baseline to 12 months [t(34) =-.4, p=.66].
Conclusions: Findings indicate that MCI is prevalent in individuals
with severe obesity, regardless of age, and often improves following
bariatric surgery. Further investigation of the mechanisms connecting
severe obesity and cognitive function is much needed, particularly studies that examine cerebral perfusion and metabolism.

Semantic Fluency Performance in MCI for Different Categories.
Objective: Semantic fluency performance provides information about
semantic processes and the organization of semantic representations. In
older adults, it is sensitive to cognitive difficulties in the early prodromal
stage of Alzheimer’s disease and in Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI).
In both practice and research, several different semantic categories have
been used, but there is limited systematic study about their comparability. Here, we examined the performance of an MCI group and healthy
controls (HC) on three different semantic categories: animals, fruits and
vegetables, and musical instruments.
Participants and Methods: Seventeen MCI (mean age 81, 15 years
of education) and 27 HC (mean age of 78, 15 years of education)
participants were given sixty seconds to provide items for three categories. Each category was scored for total words provided, number
of subcategory switches, and semantic clusters for each fifteen-second

interval. A 2 x 4 (Group x Interval) ANOVA) was conducted for each
semantic category.
Results: For each category, the MCI group produced fewer total words,
switches, and clusters than the HC group, and large effect size differences were found. There was a consistent pattern of significantly better
performance in the first 15 seconds compared to the final 15 seconds
for both groups across all three categories.
Conclusions: Findings suggest a similar pattern of impairment across
semantic categories in the MCI group as compared to the HC group.
The more pronounced difficulty in the initial time period of performance
may reflect the need for additional resources (e.g., strategy deployment,
working memory) associated with the engagement of semantic retrieval
processes. These findings have implications for the use of alternative
categories in clinical practice and research.

J.C. SHERMAN, C. HENDERSON, S. FLYNN, J. GAIR, S. MANCUSO,
A. JANMOHAMMED & B.C. LUST. Language in Prodromal
Alzheimer’s Disease: Advancing Clinical Examination.
Objective: A recent report assessing the clinical utility of language evaluation in probable AD concludes that language screening measures,
particularly, semantic fluency and confrontation naming help track dementia severity (Weiner, 2008). Other aspects of language, specifically
word repetition and articulation were not impacted. In this study, We
ask whether more complex aspects of language production assessed with
easily administered and scored tasks detect changes prior to dementia
diagnosis, when treatment is likely to be most effective and thus advance
the clinical utility of language testing in AD development.
Participants and Methods: 21 MCI subjects (mean age 75) and 24
healthy age (HA) matched subjects were administered an extended dementia screen, the Addenbrooke’s Cognitive Estimation Test-Revised
(ACE-R), which includes a ‘language’ domain, and two novel tests involving more complex aspects of language: an Elicited Imitation test that
required subjects to repeat sets of 3 different types of complex sentences
and a test that required them to create a sentence based on 3 words,
including semantically related and unrelated words.
Results: MCI subjects were significantly deficted compared to HA on
these extended language tests, and their errors suggest specific difficulty with syntax-semantic integration required at more complex levels
of language computation. Although total ACE-R scores differentiated
these two groups, their total language domain scores did not. The only
components of the ACE-R Language measures which significantly differentiated MCI from HA were semantic fluency and naming; repetition,
phonemic fluency, comprehension, reading and writing did not.
Conclusions: We discuss our findings in terms of implications for
understanding aspects of language beyond the single word level that
change prior to clinical diagnosis of AD and our tasks as potentially
useful for detecting these changes at early prodromal stages. We argue
that more sensitive language measures may aid in early detection of AD.

Objective: To evaluate the efficacy of memory training in patients with

Participants and Methods: aMCI participants were randomized to

experimental condition, patients were trained in a mnemonic strategy to
improve memory for face-name association, while in control condition
they were exposed to content on memory and aging. Cognitive evaluations and fMRI exams were conducted before and after interventions.
Results: Nineteen aMCI participants (mean age 72,6 ± 6,4) were included in data analysis, 10 in experimental group (EG) and 9 in control
group (CG). After interventions, EG showed significant improvements in
target measures (related to training), such as number of hits (EG: 27,4
± 5,2 and CG: 14,3 ± 3,6; p<0,001) and confidence level of response
(EG: 3,3 ± 0,5 and CG: 2,3 ± 0,0; p<0,001), which was not seen in CG.
On the other hand, CG showed a significant faster performance than EG
for untrained stimuli (EG: 14,6 ± 6,8 and CG: 10,4 ± 2,9; p<0,001).
Regarding the transfer measures (not related to training), EG showed
significant improvements in trained strategy use in a face-name association task (EG: 4,5 ± 2,0 and CG: 2,6 ± 1,5; p<0,001), as well as in
measures of episodic memory (Hopkins Verbal Learning Test and Short
Cognitive Test - SKT) and subjective memory (Multifactorial Memory
Questionnaire). There was no difference in attention tasks (SKT) and
mood scales (Beck Inventories) after interventions. Moreover, fMRI data
showed a significantly BOLD effect/response in left angular gyrus and
precuneus in EG, but not CG.
Conclusions: These preliminary data suggest memory training-specific effects comprising significant improvements in target and transfer
cognitive measures, associated with activation in brain areas involved
in episodic memory.

A.R. STABLER & J. MORRIS. Conversion to mild cognitive
impairment at follow-up among baseline cognitively normal, older
adult research participants and clinic patients with subjective
cognitive impairment.
Objective: Early detection of decline from normal cognition to mild
cognitive impairment (MCI) is imperative to investigating emerging
treatments for prevention of cognitive decline (Petersen, 2004). Clinicians often encounter patients with subjective memory complaints who
perform within normal limits on objective neuropsychological testing at
baseline (Mitchell et al., 2014). These patients are likely at an increased
risk for decline to MCI at repeat evaluations. The aim of the present
investigation is to examine conversion to MCI at a follow-up evaluation among baseline cognitively normal yet subjectively impaired older
adults (>65 years) within the research and clinic setting.
Participants and Methods: Older adult (>65 years) subjects were selected from the National Alzheimer’s Coordinating Center’s Uniform
Data Set (NACC-UDS; Weintraub et al., 2009), including healthy controls (N=103) without baseline cognitive complaints, and both research
volunteers (N=103) and clinic patients (N=103) with baseline subjective
memory complaints. All subjects received a consensus diagnosis of normal cognition at a baseline evaluation. Chi-Square (X2) statistics were
utilized to examine between-group differences in proportion of patients
converting to MCI at the time of follow up evaluation.
Results: Twenty-eight clinic patients (27.2%), 14 research participants
(13.6%), and 4 healthy controls (3.9%) converted to MCI over a 3-year
time period. Proportionately, clinic patients were significantly more
likely to convert to MCI at follow-up in comparison to both research
patients (X2 = 5.862, p = .015) and healthy controls (X2 = 21.310, p
< .001). Additionally, research patients were more likely to convert in
comparison to controls (X2 = 6.087, p = .014).
Conclusions: Older adult clinic patients with subjective memory complaints in the absence of objective impairment at baseline are at an
increased risk for future cognitive decline, highlighting the need for repeat evaluations with these intact yet subjectively impaired individuals.

Reduced Cortical Thickness in Older Adults with Mild Cognitive
Impairment.
Objective: We investigated the relationship between apolipoprotein E
(APOE)-ε4 genotype, white matter lesions (WML), and cortical thickness in an empirically-derived group of older adults with mild cognitive
impairment (MCI) who were drawn from the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). We also examined whether the association
between WML and cortical thickness is modified by APOE-ε4 genotype.
Participants and Methods: ADNI participants were classified as
having MCI (n = 49) via cluster analysis of neuropsychological scores
(Edmonds et al., 2015) which yielded a robust sample given removal
of false positive diagnostic errors. Participants underwent MR imaging and APOE genotyping. Surface maps of cortical thickness were
generated from T1-weighted images using FreeSurfer. We excluded
individuals with an APOE-ε2 allele given the possible protective role
of this particular allele.
Results: Regression analyses adjusting for age and sex revealed that
the presence of the APOE-ε4 allele was significantly associated with reduced thickness in frontal and parahippocampal regions. Greater WML
volume was associated with reduced cortical thickness in insula, frontal
cortex, and cingulate regions. Additionally, results revealed significant
interactions between APOE-ε4 positivity and WML changes on several
brain areas, most prominently in frontal and cingulate regions.
Conclusions: Results demonstrate that the presence of the APOE-ε4
allele and greater WML volume were independently associated with
reduced cortical thickness in an empirically-derived group of ADNI
older adults with MCI. Additionally, the presence of the APOE-ε4 allele
modified the relationship between WML volume and cortical thickness
in regions vulnerable to Alzheimer’s disease. These findings provide
further support for the influence of APOE genotype and WML in neurodegenerative processes later in life, and further highlight the complex
interplay between genetic risk and modifiable health-related risk factors
in early stages of cognitive decline.

G. ALVAREZ, S.T. LI & B. NAGEL. Sleep/Wake Problems Are
Associated With Reduced Visuospatial Performance During
Adolescence.
Objective: Adolescents face unique barriers to adequate sleep, contributing to a variety of academic, emotional, and behavioral impairments.
Insufficient sleep has been inconsistently associated with neurocognitive
deficits, resulting in a lack of clarity regarding its functional impact.
The purpose of this study was to further investigate the influence of
adolescent sleep adequacy on neurocognitive functioning.
Participants and Methods: Participants (n = 129) were typically developing, right-handed adolescents, ages 12-17. All youth completed
the School Sleep Habits Survey (SSHS) and several neuropsychological
tests. The SSHS Sleep/Wake Problems scale, a self-report measure of
erratic sleeping and waking behaviors, was examined as a predictor of
age-corrected neurocognitive test performance.
Results: Three linear regression analyses were used to evaluate the relationship between SSHS Sleep/Wake Problems and scores on composite
measures of memory (Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test; Wide Range
Assessment of Memory and Learning-2 (WRAML-2) Design Memory),
attention/executive functions (WISC-IV Digit Span; Conners Continuous Performance Test-2; D-KEFS Color-Word Interference), and visuospatial ability (WASI Block Design & Matrix Reasoning; WRAML2
Design Memory). Higher scores on the SSHS Sleep/Wake Problems
scale were associated with significantly poorer visuospatial performance,

184
F(1,127) = 9.60, p < .01, R2 = .07. Sleep/wake problems were not
significantly associated with performance on composite measures of
attention/executive function or memory (p’s > .05).
Conclusions: These findings may be suggestive of a distinct relationship
between sleep/wake problems and visuospatial dysfunction, which could
have adverse implications for school performance, spatial awareness,
and nonverbal communication. Future research may consider the role
of adequate sleep and erratic sleep/wake behaviors on right hemisphere
functions and associated brain networks.

Results: A linear mixed effect model was used for preliminary analysis.
We found a main effect of eye viewing and line deviation, but not of page
placement relative to eye level. We found an interaction between eye
viewing and visual space and an interaction between eye viewing and
line placement. Left eye viewing resulted in higher bisections relative
to right eye and binocular viewing.
Conclusions: Directing focal and global attention is in part dependent
on a specialized lateralization between hemispheres. Monocular occlusion had an effect on the disparity between the two, in which global distraction causes line bisections to deviate towards the center of the page.

K.T. BALAVAGE, D. LAMB, L. KNIGHT, D. BIELICK, K.J. KINCAID
& K.M. HEILMAN. The Effects of the Allocation of Focal Attention
and Habituation on the Line Bisection Task.
Objective: Due to limited neurological processing resources, humans
often restrict the processing of their sensory input. In the visual domain,
certain spatial locations are attended to over others and attended locations appear to have a greater magnitude than less attended locations.
An additional aspect of attention is habituation, in which a stimulus
loses its importance or novelty, and the amount of attentional resources
allocated to it decreases over time. Line bisections are a commonly used
method to assess allocation of attention. The objective of this study is
to determine if visual habituation influences horizontal line bisection
performance in neurologically normal individuals.
Participants and Methods: Participants were 36 neurologically normal, right-handed subjects (mean age= 23.2; 19 women). The stimuli
were 24cm x 2mm black lines, presented in a horizontal orientation.
The participants were asked to focus either on the entire line, or the
left side, or right side of the line, and then were asked to bisect the line
immediately or after a 20 second delay in which they remained focused
on the portion of the line that they were assigned. Deviation from the
center was measured in millimeters.
Results: There was a significant main effect of attentional focus (left
side, right side, or whole line) and an interaction between attentional
focus and delayed viewing, but no main effect of delay. Viewing a certain portion of the line resulted in a significant deviation towards the
attended side. In addition, delayed line bisection significantly enhanced
the degree of deviation towards the portion of the line that was attended.
Conclusions: Overall, directing the participants to focus on a portion of
the line caused deviation towards that portion. Prolonged allocation of
attention increased bias toward the attended portion. This change may
have been related to habituation to the unattended portion of the line
or enhanced allocation of attention to the targeted portion of the line.

Left Entorhinal Cortex is Associated with Route Learning Based on
Self-motion and Local Cues.
Objective: The hippocampus and entorhinal cortex play complementary
roles in spatial navigation. Whereas place cells in the hippocampus represent locations “allocentrically” based on boundaries and landmarks,
irrespective of the subject’s position, recent investigations suggest that
grid cells in the entorhinal cortex dynamically update where a subject
is in space based on self-motion cues, a process important for path
integration. We investigated the contributions of these structures to
performance on a virtual route learning task that emphasizes learning
based on self-motion and that provides no allocentric cues.
Participants and Methods: Sixty-six cognitively healthy older adults
(mean age: 72 ± 6.5) learned a defined route through a virtual neighborhood via trial and error using a driving simulator. No allocentric cues
were available, only local cues and the subject’s virtual position. The
task included 15 sequential trials of a 15-turn route, with performance
quantified as the sum of correct turns for trials 2-15. Each subject also
underwent 3T MRI analyzed using Freesurfer to calculate bilateral grey
matter volumes of hippocampus and entorhinal cortex.
Results: Partial correlations controlling for age and intracranial volume revealed that only left entorhinal cortex (p<.05) was significantly
associated with total accuracy. Partial correlations with right entorhinal
cortex and bilateral hippocampus were not significant.
Conclusions: These findings support the view that the left entorhinal
cortex is important for route learning based on self-motion and local
cues, and contrasts the established role of the hippocampus in allocentric
navigation.

& K.M. HEILMAN. Hemispheric Lateralization of Attentional
Background Distraction.
Objective: During line bisection, when a line is placed eccentrically on
a page normal people deviate toward the center of the page. This whole
page deviation may be related to the activation of the global attentional
system. Monocular eye viewing can increase activation of a contralateral
hemisphere (the Sprague effect). Since the left hemisphere mediates
focal attention and the right global attention, monocular viewing with
the left (versus right) eye, may increase global attention and thereby
increase deviation to the center of the page.
Participants and Methods: 36 healthy participants (17 men, mean
age =23.2) were asked to bisect twelve vertical lines (2mm x 210mm)
with 6 displaced upward on the page and 6 downward. The sheets of
paper were presented in portrait orientation over a black board. These
conditions were repeated with left eye patching, right eye patching, and
binocular viewing.

C. CHIU, M. ESTERMAN & J. DEGUTIS. Tablet-based visuospatial
battery briefly assesses a wide range of hemispatial neglect
symptomatology.
Objective: Current batteries for diagnosing hemispatial neglect typically
rely on paper-and-pencil tests or long computer-based tasks, which
can be time consuming and challenging to analyze. We developed a
brief iPad battery to both quickly and reliably detect attentional and,
using kinematic information, motoric aspects of neglect. We sought to
characterize lateralized target detection, lateralized hypokinesia, visual
search, memory for searched locations, and egocentric/allocentric bias.
Participants and Methods: We administered a 15-min iPad battery
of 4 tasks to 9 chronic left neglect patients (diagnosed via a 45-minute
paper-and-pencil and computerized battery) and 5 right-brain-injured
controls. Our battery included apples cancellation (one with visual feedback and one without), character line bisection, a find-the-dot task
where subjects touch 48 serially-presented dots at various locations, and
a follow-the-dot task which required continuously tracking a moving
dot for 2.5 mins.
Results: The most robust differences between those with and without
neglect were leftward hypokinesia in the follow-the-dot task (p=.0031)
and leftward hypokinesia/target detection failures in the find-the-dot

Forty Fourth Annual INS Meeting Abstracts
task (p=.011). Memory for searched locations (difference between
search accuracy with and without feedback) was also significantly worse
in neglect patients across hemifields (p=. 018). Finally, we found significant allocentric bias differences between neglect and controls in the
apples task (p=.019) and egocentric bias differences on the character
line bisection task (p=.047).
Conclusions: A brief iPad battery can detect several attentional and
motoric aspects of hemispatial neglect. Interestingly, kinematic information, which can only be gleaned from touch screens, most robustly
differentiated those with and without neglect. These finding have implications for more efficiently diagnosing neglect as well as tracking
neglect recovery/rehabilitation.

Results: Ms. B showed awareness of moving stimuli in all visual fields;
however, marked visuo-perceptual disturbance was noted on the examination. Performance on visual scanning and cancellation tests was
highly suggestive of simultagnosia, as were behavioral observations.
She did not show significant optic apraxia, or optic ataxia, suggestive
of relative sparing of aspects of visual dorsal stream function. While Ms.
B demonstrated severe verbal memory difficulty she was not completely
amnestic, which is atypical for anoxic brain injury. MRI showed occipital/parietal anoxic injury.
Conclusions: We report a case of simultagnosia secondary to anoxic
brain injury, in the context of global cognitive dysfunction. Ventral vs.
dorsal contributions to Ms. B’s presentation will be discussed. Recommendations for continued rehabilitation services and accommodations
in light of her deficits will also be discussed.

I. VAN DER HAM. Navigation Ability After Stroke: An Analysis of
Types of Navigation Impairment in Chronic Stroke Patients.
Objective: Recent research has stressed the complex cognitive nature of
navigation ability. This ability relies on multiple neural structures and
networks and is evidently vulnerable to brain damage. More specifically,
nearly 30% of stroke patients complain about difficulties with navigation after their stroke event. The aim of this study was to systematically
analyse both group and individual performance of stroke patients on a
test that captures the complexity of this ability.
Participants and Methods: The Virtual Tübingen navigation test was
administered to a heterogeneous group of 77 chronic stroke patients, and
60 healthy controls. This test contains twelve subtasks that address multiple aspects of landmark, route and survey knowledge of a virtual route.
Results: At group level, a series of ANOVAs showed that healthy controls performed significantly better on five subtests compared to the patients. These performance differences were found for scene recognition,
map drawing and three route knowledge subtasks.
As stroke patients are not a neurologically uniform group, we also analyzed their individual patterns of subtask performance using z-scores.
Impairment patterns (i.e. z ≤ –1.65) ranged from highly selective (e.g.
inability to derive directional information from landmarks) to more
general (e.g. impaired route knowledge). None of them was impaired
on more than five of the twelve subtasks.
Conclusions: Overall, patients had more difficulties with the navigation
test than healthy controls. At the individual level, analyses of performance patterns showed that nearly all patients have relative strengths
and weaknesses in their performance on the subtasks. These individual
patterns of impaired and intact performance are informative in two
ways. Firstly, associations and dissociations between the subabilities
could offer further insight in the neurocognitive architecture of navigation. Furthermore, these patterns provide a starting point for a training
that teaches them to rely on their intact navigation abilities.

Simultagonsia in an Anoxic Brain Injury.
Objective: Anoxic brain injuries are typically associated with severe
anterograde memory deficits in the context of diffuse cognitive dysfunction. We report a case (Ms. B) of anoxic brain injury who presented
6 months post injury with relative improvements in global cognitive
functioning and memory, but persistent visuospatial deficit, such that
rehabilitation efforts were suspended pending further evaluation.
Participants and Methods: Ms. B is a 55 year old Caucasian woman
with history of Bipolar disorder. The anoxic injury was associated with
cardiac arrest secondary to possible overdose of psychiatric medications.
She was admitted to the ED with a GCS of 3 and was amnestic for the
several weeks prior to and following the injury. Ms. B was administered
a broad neuropsychological battery to examine the nature of her cognitive deficits, with specific emphasis on visuospatial and visuoperceptual
processing.

& K.M. HEILMAN. Influence of Viewing Eye on Altitudinal
Attentional Bias.
Objective: It has been posited that whereas the right hemisphere has a
relatively upward attentional bias, the left may have a downward bias.
Since monocular viewing primarily activates the contralateral hemisphere (Sprague effect) the goal of this study was to learn if right versus
left monocular eye viewing would differentially alter vertical attentional
bias as determined by the vertical line bisection task.
Participants and Methods: 36 right-handed healthy participants (19
women, mean age=23.2 years, STD=2.68) performed the vertical line
(2mm x 210mm) bisection tasks with the line presented in the participants’ mid-sagittal plane at varying altitudes in extracorporeal visual
space while wearing an eye patch over their right, left, or neither eye.
There were six trials in each of the nine conditions for a total 54 bisections per subject.
Results: Analysis reveals an overall mean upward deviation (vertical
pseudoneglect) in attempted vertical line bisections independent of stimuli position and subjects’ viewing conditions. Furthermore, monocular
viewing with the left or right eye induced a greater upward bias than
binocular viewing.
Conclusions: Left monocular viewing when compared to right monocular viewing did not result in greater upward deviation as predicted,
but monocular viewing with either eye induced a greater deviation than
binocular viewing; however, the reason for this difference is not known.

L. KNIGHT, D. LAMB, K.T. BALAVAGE, D. BIELICK, K.J. KINCAID
& K.M. HEILMAN. Effects of Focal and Global Spatial Attention on
Compound Line Bisection Tasks.
Objective: When healthy participants attempt to bisect horizontal
compound lines (made of two segments of different thickness) they
tend to deviate to the longer segment and when attempting to bisect
one segment of a compound line they deviate toward the center of the
entire compound line. Bisecting the entire line requires global attention
and bisecting a segment requires focal attention, but in each of these
tasks the allocation of global versus focal attention is incomplete and
there is a deviation induced by activation of the alternative network.
The goal of this study was to learn if there is greater deviation when the
distracting element is on the top or bottom of the line with vertical line
bisections, as well as to learn if there are differences with right versus
left eye monocular viewing.
Participants and Methods: 36 neurologically healthy right-handed
subjects performed vertical line or line segment bisection tasks requiring
either global or focal processing with left and right eye monocular viewing. Compound lines, made up of two line segments of different lengths

186
and thicknesses were marked either at the midpoint of the whole line
(global) or at the midpoint of the longer line segment (focal).
Results: In the global compound line bisection task participants significantly deviated towards the longer segment and in the focal segment
task towards the midpoint of the entire line. In addition, when the longer
segment was on the top there was greater deviation than when on the
bottom. When attempting to just bisect the longer segment there was
also a greater distraction by the short segment when it was on top than
on the bottom. There were no significant differences between monocular
versus binocular viewing or viewing with the right versus the left eye.
Conclusions: These results suggest that when bisecting the entire compound line or the longer segment of a compound line there is more
distraction by the upper than lower segment. This asymmetry may be
related to the ventral stream’s mediation of focal attention.

Affairs Hospital. A two-factor solution of Benton’s JLO that showed
independent performance on early and late items was combined with
age and education. Age and early items of JLO loaded together while
education and late items of JLO loaded together. The age_early JLO factor and the education_late JLO factor was combined with the WAIS-III.
Results: The age_early JLO component loaded with Perceptual Organization (PO) and Processing Speed (PS), while the education_late JLO
component loaded with Verbal Comprehension (VC) explaining 84.45%
of the shared variance.
Conclusions: The four-factor solution demonstrated that there is an
age-related component of visuospatial perception, which is related to
nonverbal conceptual reasoning and speed of mental processing. There
is also an independent education-related aspect of visuospatial functioning, which is verbal mediated. Both verbal and nonverbal components
were independent of attention and working memory.

J. FISHER & S. ROGERS. How Important is it to Distinguish
between Specific Visuospatial Abilities in PD and AD?
Objective: While research has supported a relationship between declining visuospatial abilities and both Alzheimer disease (AD) and
Parkinson’s disease (PD), there is a lack of specificity regarding the
particular areas of visuospatial degeneration that are involved. This
study examines specific visuospatial differences within and between
those afflicted with AD and PD.
Participants and Methods: A total of 214 adults (121 men; M age =
73.61; M education = 14.84 years) with mixed ethnicity participated
in comprehensive neuropsychological assessment as part of outpatient
neurology evaluations. Specific visuospatial measures included the
Rey-Osterrieth Complex Figure Test (RCFT) and WAIS-IV Block Design and Picture Completion.
Results: Those with PD performed worse on WAIS-IV Block Design,
t(174) = 3.16, p < .001, and RCFT Copy, t(169) = 2.36, p < .02 than
those without. Those diagnosed with AD performed worse on WAIS-IV
Picture Completion than those without, t(201) = 2.89, p < .01, but
there were no significant differences in WAIS-IV Block Design or RCFT.
Those with PD performed worse on WAIS-IV Block Design, t(167) =
3.71, p < .001, and RCFT Copy, t(163) = 2.39, p < .02 than those
with AD.
Conclusions: Results suggest unique visuospatial differences between
and within PD and AD. A Parkinson’s pathology appears to differentially and adversely affect visual construction and drawing. Deficits
appear in visual discrimination/ perception among those with AD, but
their visual construction and drawing seem to be less affected. Visual
construction and drawing seem to be significantly more impacted by
Parkinson’s than Alzheimer’s pathologies, whereas visual discrimination/perceptual skills seem to be similarly impacted by both pathologies.
This suggests that not all visuospatial abilities are equally affected by
AD and PD, intimating unique biochemical, neural, and connectivity
substrates for visuospatial functioning within/between each condition.

correlates of long-term neurobehavioral outcomes in pediatric
traumatic brain injury.
There is significant literature supporting various degrees of long-term
neurobehavioral deficits, including neurocognition and social cognition,
following a traumatic brain injury (TBI) in childhood. The extent of
deficits is moderated by a number of factors, including nature and
severity of injury, in addition to personal and premorbid factors. The
injury related pathophysiology following a brain injury that underlies
neurobehavioral morbidity has been characterized by a number of both
functional/metabolic and structural brain imaging studies, allowing us
to better understand the course of repair and recovery that follows a
TBI in childhood. These pathophysiological changes include permanent
or transient disruptions in network connections that allow for higher
order cognitive functions, volumetric changes in key brain structures

paper, neuroimaging markers that help explain the nature of long term
neurobehavioral deficits related to injury related variables will be reviewed, and results from the UCLA longitudinal study of multi-modal
neuroimaging in pediatric TBI will be presented.

M.H. BEAUCHAMP, J. ANSADO, E. VERA-ESTAY, J. COOPER,
V. ANDERSON & J. DOOLEY. Moral Reasoning after Pediatric
TBI: A Brain-Behavior Perspective.
Objective: Adolescents who sustain TBI are at particular risk for developing socially maladaptive behaviors as a consequence of the cognitive
and neural disruptions associated with their injuries, which occur at a
crucial time for social maturation. Deviations in the way individuals
think about the conventions that govern their social interactions (i.e.,
moral reasoning, MR) can lead to problematic behaviors, yet few studies
have addressed the putative link between TBI and MR. We investigated
both the brain and behavioral manifestations of MR in adolescents with
TBI.
Materials and Methods: In Study 1, we documented MR in 47 adolescents (14.6 years ± 1.7) with TBI of all severity levels using the SoMoral task, which consists of visual, first-person socio-moral dilemmas
(Beauchamp et al., 2013). In Study 2, 12 adolescents with TBI and 11
controls (15.9 years ± 1.6) completed the So-Moral task during fMRI
in a Siemens 3T Trio scanner. MR conditions were compared to neutral
social decision-making conditions.
Results: Adolescents with TBI had significantly poorer MR (p<.001),
with greater injury severity associated with less mature reasoning and
more inappropriate decision making (p<.01). fMRI analyses revealed
clusters of both hyper- and hypo-activation after TBI in areas commonly
associated with socio-affective functioning, including the medial prefrontal cortex, cingulate and amygdala.
Conclusion: MR appears to be reduced after TBI in adolescents and less
mature MR is associated with changes in the activity of brain regions
responsible for social and emotional functioning. Understanding the
brain-behavior relationships surrounding MR after TBI has potential for
improving early identification of youth at risk for social decision-making
difficulties and problem behaviors.

Relationships Following Pediatric TBI.
Objective: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) may have important consequences for peer relationships, particularly in children, but investigation
of TBI-altered neural correlates of social functioning is limited. We
assessed white matter (WM) integrity using diffusion tensor imaging
(DTI) and examined its relation with two salient features of peer relationships: closeness of peer friendships and level of a child’s loneliness.
Participants and Methods: Forty children with complicated mild to
severe TBI and 26 children with orthopedic injury (OI) with comparable demographics (sex, race, SES) were recruited. Age was controlled.
Participants completed the Berndt & Keefe Friendship Questionnaire
and the Asher Children’s Loneliness Survey. In addition, each participant underwent DTI at 12 months post-injury. Fractional anisotropy
(FA) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) of the corpus callosum
(CC), genu of the CC, cingulum bundles (CB), inferior fronto-occipital
fasciculi (IFOF), and frontal WM were calculated using quantitative
tractography.
Results: The TBI group exhibited lower FA and higher ADC (all p<.01)
for all WM regions except the CB. Contrary to expectation, groups did

187
not differ on loneliness or friendship. In the OI group, loneliness correlated with FA of the genu (Spearman’s partial ρ=-.45), and right
and left frontal regions (ρ=-.56 and ρ=-.48, respectively), and ADC of
the genu (ρ=.43) and right frontal regions (ρ=.44). In the TBI group,
loneliness correlated with FA of the CC (ρ=-.34), and left IFOF (ρ=.39), such that lower WM integrity indicated more loneliness. Only FA
of right and left CB of the OI group correlated with friendship (ρ=-.49
and ρ=-.52, respectively).
Conclusion: These findings indicate that WM injury may contribute to
social relationships in children. Further research is needed to address
additional aspects of social functioning and how alteration of brain
structure may contribute to these important deficits.

M.H. BEAUCHAMP, K.O. YEATES & V. ANDERSON. Theory of
Mind Mediates the Prospective Relationship Between Abnormal
Social Brain Network Morphology and Chronic Behavior Problems
after Pediatric Traumatic Brain injury (TBI).
Objective. Childhood and adolescence coincide with rapid maturation
and synaptic reorganization of distributed neural networks that underlie complex cognitive-affective behaviors. These regions, referred to
collectively as the ‘social brain network’ (SBN) are commonly vulnerable to disruption from pediatric TBI; however, the mechanisms that
link morphological changes in the SBN to behaviour problems in this
population remain unclear. This study aimed to evaluate the sub-acute
effect of pediatric TBI on SBN morphology, and evaluate prospective
relationships between sub-acute magnetic resonance-based morphometry, ToM, and long-term behavioral problems.
Participants and Methods. In 98 children with mild to severe TBI, we
acquired 3D T1 weighted MRIs at 2-8 weeks post injury. For comparison, 33 typically developing controls of similar age, sex and education
were scanned. All participants were assessed on measures of Theory of
Mind (ToM) six months post-injury and parents provided ratings of
behavior problems 24-months post-injury.
Results. Participants with severe TBI showed abnormal SBN morphology, as well local gray matter structural change in multiple component
cortical regions of the SBN. Compared to controls and children with
milder injuries, the severe TBI group had significantly poorer ToM,
which was associated with more frequent behavior problems and abnormal SBN morphology. Mediation analysis indicated that impaired
ToM mediated the relationship between structural change in the SBN
and more frequent behavior problems.
Conclusions. Global and local structural changes in the SBN are present
as early as 2-months post-severe TBI. These sub-acute alterations in
SBN morphology indirectly contribute to long-term behavior problems
via their influence on ToM. Structural change in the SBN and its putative
hub regions may represent a useful imaging biomarker for prediction of
post-acute ToM impairment, which may in turn elevate risk for chronic
behaviour problems.

M. MCGUE. Late-Life Change in Cognitive Function: Evidence
from Longitudinal Twin Research.
: One of the most robust observations from psychological gerontology is
the aging of cognitive abilities. On average cognitive function declines
in late life, although the magnitude of decline and when it first emerges
vary across ability domains. Significantly, there are marked individual
differences in rate of cognitive decline, with some individuals experiencing little if any cognitive impairment as they get older while other
individuals are especially sensitive to the effects of aging. Behavioral genetic methodology and specifically twin studies can help to characterize
the nature and origin of individual differences in behavior. Results from
two large-scale Danish longitudinal twin studies will be described to
illustrate the utility of behavioral genetic methodologies in psychological
gerontology. The first is the Longitudinal Study of Aging Danish Twins
(LSADT), a cohort sequential study of 4371 Danish twins age 70 and
older, whose cognitive function was assessed every two years for up to six
times. The second is the Middle Age Danish Twin study (MADT), which
consists of a sample of more than 4000 twins, whose cognitive function
was assessed initially at mid-life (mean[SD] age of 56.9 [6.3]) and then
again approximately 10 years later (66.7 [6.1]). Results from analysis
of the LSADT and MADT longitudinal datasets will be presented to
show the extent to which genetic and environmental factors contribute
to late-life cognitive change. In addition, we will show how twin studies
can be used to address the confounding that complicate causal inference
in observational gerontology, using as examples the relationships of
education and intellectual engagement with late-life cognitive function.

Interplay in Cognitive Aging and Dementia.
Symposium Description: Behavior genetics has provided us with a
great deal of information on the relative importance of genetic and environmental factors for brain and cognitive aging. Much of the evidence
has been based on twin studies of aging and focused on establishing the
heritability of cognitive abilities and trajectories, brain development,
morphology and function. Few studies have taken the next step, i.e., to
explore the extent to which there is interplay between genes and relevant environments for brain and cognitive aging. The purpose of this
symposium is to provide examples of how behavioral genetic approaches
can help us explore how genes, environments and their interplay are
important for cognitive aging and dementia. To begin this symposium,
Dr. Kremen will provide an overview of the contribution of behavioral
genetics to an understanding of cognitive and brain aging, including
recent findings from MRI studies in twins. Dr. McGue will follow with
examples of gene-environment interplay involving education, intellectual engagement and late-life cognitive functioning. Next, Dr. Gatz will
discuss evidence for sex differences in genetic influences on dementia.
Finally, Dr. Pedersen will discuss how epigenetics, i.e. DNA methylation
patterns, may contribute to gene-environment interplay in cognitive
aging and dementia. The discussant will explore application of findings
for neuropsychology and brain health.

W.S. KREMEN, M. PANIZZON, J.A. ELMAN, M. LYONS &
C. FRANZ. Contributions of Behavior Genetics to Cognitive and
Brain Aging.
Objective: In the 21st century, it is becoming increasingly important
for neuropsychologists to have some familiarity with genetics. Here we
provide an overview of behavior genetic findings about brain structure
and its relationship to cognition.
Participants and Methods: 550 twins from the Vietnam Era Twin Study
of Aging (VETSA): ages 51-60 at VETSA 1; ages 56-66 at VETSA 2.
Primarily 3D structural MRI analyzed with FreeSurfer. Focus for this
presentation is on general cognitive ability based on the Armed Forces
Qualification Test.
Results: We describe the genetic relationship between cortical thickness
and cortical surface area, and the complex relationship between those
phenotypes and cognition. We describe behavior genetic findings with
regard to age-related changes in brain structure. We also describe some
findings of interest with regard to APOE genotype and its relationship
to brain and cognition.
Conclusions: It is only relatively recently—following the development of
semi-automated methods for image post-processing—that large-sample
MRI studies have been possible. Twin studies require very large sample
sizes, so it is also only relatively recently that it has been possible for
substantial progress to have been made in twin studies of brain structure. Both brain and cognition are highly polygenic phenotypes. That is,
they are influenced by many genes, each of very small effect. That lack
of large single-gene effects can make it very difficult to identify specific
genes in genetic association studies. Although twin studies do not identify specific genes, they do account for the total aggregate influence of
genes. The work presented demonstrates how twin studies constitute an
important complement to molecular genetic studies for understanding
the genetic underpinnings of brain and cognition.

M. GATZ & C.R. BEAM. Contributions of Twin Studies to
Discerning Sex Differences in Dementia.
Objective: Research supports that there are more women than men with
Alzheimer’s disease and with dementia in general. The aim of our study
was to apply a twin design toward ascertaining the role of gene and
environment interplay in accounting for sex differences in dementia.
Participants and Methods: Participants were 15,634 twins from the
population-based Swedish Twin Registry. Subsets of the population
were enrolled in longitudinal studies of cognition, and in 1998-2001
the entire registry was screened for cognitive dysfunction. Dementia
diagnoses were made based on clinical evaluations and through national
hospitalization and cause of death registries. Results: Among twins aged
65+, prevalence of dementia was 11% for men; 16% for women. Incidence was similar until age 85+ after which more women than men
developed dementia. Genetic correlations were .15 for monozygotic male
pairs, .18 for dizygotic male pairs, .35 for MZ female pairs, .17 for DZ
female pairs, and .07 for unlike sex pairs. Within opposite sex pairs,
women were 21% more likely than men to be diagnosed with dementia.
For women, youngest age of onset was among those with two e4 alleles,
intermediate for those with one e4 allele, and oldest for those with no
e4. For men, having one e4 allele had little effect on age of onset, but
having two e4 alleles was significantly associated with a younger age of
onset. Conclusions: Sex differences in dementia prevalence seem largely
a function of women’s greater longevity, although there is some evidence of higher incidence among oldest old women, possibly reflecting
competing risks and survival bias. Additive genetic influences may be
relatively more important for women in accounting for risk of dementia,
while environmental factors—including environments shared between
members of the twin pair—may be relatively more important for men’s
risk for dementia.

N. PEDERSEN, I.K. KARLSSON & S. HÄGG. Epigenetic processes:
A Potential Mechanism for Gene Environment Interplay?
There are a number of types of gene-environment interplay, such as active gene-environment correlation (niche picking) in which individuals
create or select their own environments as a function of their genetic propensities, or gene-environment interaction, in which the effect of genetic
variants differs as a function of the “environment”. Gene-environment
correlation, be it active or passive, may be tractable by evaluating the extent to which genotypes are unevenly distributed among environments.
Gene environment interaction, on the other hand, may be a function of
an environmental “trigger” that may turn on or turn off gene expression.
Epigenetic processes may represent one such mechanism resulting in
gene environment interaction. In this presentation, evidence of DNA
methylation as a potential source of gene environment interaction for
cognitive aging and dementia will be provided.

T. MEREDITH-DULIBA, J. WILLIAMS & K. OSIPOWICZ. MultiModal Neuroimaging Approach to the Developing Human Brain:
Infancy Through Early Adulthood.
Objective: Map normal brain development using volumetric MRI
measures of gray and white matter, magnetic resonance spectroscopy
(MRS) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). These methods allow for
the assessment of structural maturation and a set of brain metabolites
that change over the course of growth and development. These normal
developmental changes can be contrasted with patterns associated with
neurological disorders.
Participants and Methods: The study consisted of 452 normal children ranging in age from birth to 18 years. All were administered a
standard MRI protocol consisting of T1 scans, DTI scanning and MRI
Spectroscopy of N-acetylaspartate (NAA) choline, creatine, and unsuppressed water. For full details of the scanning methods see The
MRI Study of Normal Brain Development (http://pediatricmri.nih.gov).
Developmental trends were plotted for all measures and nonlinear regression procedures were applied to determine trend lines and variance
accounted for by the resulting equations.
Results: The analyses showed clear patterns of change in brain volumes and metabolites over the years. Development patterns revealed
that white matter tracts have highest initial DTI Fractional Anisotropy
and MRS measures with moderate development (R2 ≈.31). Peri-cortical
white matter areas, such as the precentral gyrus, association areas, and
frontal lobes developed at a moderate rate (R2 ≈ .49). The cerebellum
and archicortex developed least (R2 ≈.17). A consistent acute pattern of
growth presented during the first five years of brain development that
tapered off across subsequent years; similar to the pattern previously
established using volumetric measures.
Conclusions: This is the first study to examine DTI and MRS measures
from birth through adolescence. Developing a cohesive and integrated
model of development is key to identifying developmental disorders
involving the CNS.

E.D. BIGLER & T.J. ABILDSKOV. Clinical Application of
Individualized Quantitative Neuroimaging for Neuropsychology
– Precision Medicine Meets Neurocognitive Assessment.
Objective: Recently President Obama and NIH launched the Precision
Medicine Initiative. Two components of this initiative have critical importance for neuropsychology: (1) improved technologies for biomedical
analysis and (2) new tools for using large scale datasets. Excellent, reliable and quantitative MRI methods are now universally available that
provide volume, cortical thickness, surface area and other measures of
brain structure, but neuropsychology has been slow to take advantage
of these advances. Large scale single and multi-site MRI databases exist
in the public domain than can be used for both normative and pathological comparisons of individual scan findings. Since neuroanatomical
integrity as well as pathology relate to neurocognitive functioning, 21st
Century neuropsychology should incorporate neuroimaging technology
into the assessment process. Herein we demonstrate a straightforward
method to integrate quantitative neuroimaging in the service of neuropsychological assessment. An interactive 3-D portable document
format (PDF) method that utilizes individual patient FreeSurfer (freesurfer-software.org/) quantitative findings but compared to a normative
(adjusted for age and sex) dataset is demonstrated.
Participants and Methods: From the individual patient or research
subject, a volume acquisition T1-weighted sequence is processed
through the FreeSurfer pipeline. The aseg and aparc output is used for
cortical as well as subcortical ROI comparisons to a large normative
data base displayed in 3-D images.
Results: Examples from individual participants who were either controls, cases with various degenerative diseases as well as TBI will be used
to demonstrate how volumetric MRI can be interfaced with quantitative
3-D neuroimaging and neuropsychological test findings.
Conclusions: These new technologies enhance ‘precision’ patient care
in neuropsychology. When the proper imaging has been done, neuropsychology should embrace these developments and incorporate quantitative 3-D imaging analyses as routine.

Hippocampal Volume Differences in Typical and Atypical Variants
of Alzheimer’s Disease.
Objective: Alzheimer’s disease (AD) pathology can be detected using Pittsburgh Compound B (PiB) PET imaging. Typical AD (DAT)
presents as a primary amnestic syndrome, and at least two “atypical”
variants are now recognized. The logopenic variant of primary progressive aphasia (lvPPA) presents with primary language disruption and
posterior cortical atrophy (PCA) presents with visual deficits, both of
which are also commonly due to Alzheimer’s disease pathology. Here, we
compare these AD variants on measures of memory, as well as cortical
and hippocampal volumes.
Participants and Methods: We matched twenty seven PCA, 50 lvPPA,
and 77 DAT patients on age, disease duration, and gender. All subjects
showed positive beta-amyloid deposition on PiB PET, defined using a
standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR) of ≥ 1.5. PiB PET status was
not known at time of diagnosis. A priori regions of interest included the
hippocampus (Hipp) and left/right superior temporal (ST), supramarginal (SM), inferior parietal (IP), superior parietal (SP), and lateral
occipital (LO) regions. All volumes were segmented using FreeSurfer
and adjusted for total intracranial volume. Subjects also completed
memory tests.
Results: DAT subjects had poorer memory and smaller hippocampi
than lvPPA and PCA subjects. The left ST was smaller in lvPPA compared to DAT and PCA. Relative to those with lvPPA and DAT, PCA
patients had smaller right IP and bilateral SP and LO volumes.

Conclusions: Findings from these extremely well matched groups show

A. ROY, R.A. BERNIER, N. GILBERT & F.G. HILLARY. Examining
Network Strength and Cost during Recovery from Moderate and
Severe Traumatic Brain Injury.
Objective: The objective of this study is to examine the local and global
functional connectivity changes that occur following traumatic brain
injury (TBI) using resting state BOLD fMRI data. We use graph theoretical methods to examine changes in network strength and cost during
recovery and the relationship these metrics have to cognitive outcome.
Participants and Methods: Subjects included 14 individuals with
moderate and severe TBI between the ages of 21 and 54, and 12 healthy
adults with comparable age and education. Individuals with TBI were
examined using fMRI at 3, 6, and 12 months following resolution of
post traumatic amnesia. The healthy controls (HCs) were examined at
2 time points separated by 3 months. Standard preprocessing steps were
implemented using SPM8/Artrepair. Power’s 264 anatomical locations
were used as regions of interest (ROIs) to develop functional connectivity
network. Strength was defined as the absolute correlation between two
regions and network “cost” was determined as the sum of (weight *
physical distance) for each link.
Results: Individuals with TBI showed increased network strength for all
connection distances, resulting in increased network cost which peaked
at 6 months post injury, but remained elevated at 12 months. High cost
connections were most prevalent in the default mode network and fronto-parietal task control regions of the brain. Total network strength correlated to cognitive tests of speed of information processing and working
memory with r-values ranging from -0.57 to 0.67. Total network cost
correlated to cognition with r-values ranging from -0.46 to 0.475.
Conclusions: Using 3 time-point BOLD-fMRI data we were able to
examine functional connectivity changes during the first year after TBI.
Heightened network connectivity was found to be the brain’s proactive
response to injury, and correlated well with cognitive performance after

Volume is Associated with Exceptional Creativity: Preliminary
Findings from the “Big C” Project.
Objective: Prior research suggests that creativity is associated with
differences in brain structure or function but so far findings are inconsistent, and few studies have examined the brains of exceptionally
creative or “Big C” individuals. We aimed to determine if Big C individuals differ from a large healthy reference group in major brain tissue
compartments.
Participants and Methods: The “Big C Project” examines brain
structure and function in visual artists and scientists who have creative
achievement above the 99th percentile relative to large comparison
groups. We examined high-resolution MRI of Big C participants (n=20)
relative to data released from the Human Connectome Project (HCP,
n = 511). Brain MRI for Big C participants were acquired at 3T with 1
mm isotropic voxels. Segmented volumes we extracted following HCP
protocols for cortical gray, subcortical gray, cortical white, and total
intracranial contents.
Results: Multivariate analysis revealed a group effect (F (4,531)=32.7,
p<.001). Big C and HCP participants did not differ in intracranial
contents or subcortical gray matter, but Big C participants had more
white matter (F(1, 534)=13.6, p<.0005) and less cortical gray matter (F(1,534) = 10.7, p < .001). Post-hoc tests (corrected) showed
that white matter volumes were greater in visual artists (p=.031) and

scientists (p=.026) relative to the HCP group but that gray matter volume reductions were significant only in artists (p=.047), not scientists.
Conclusions: Findings suggest that exceptional creativity is associated
with greater white matter volume. The findings are of high interest given
hypotheses that exceptional creativity may be mediated by inter-regional connectional anatomy that relies on white matter. Limitations
include modest sample sizes in Big C groups, reliance on the HCP data,
and use of automated segmentation alone. Important next steps include
determining if findings are consistent with tractography, and applying
graph theoretic measures to both diffusion and functional images.

Similarities in White Matter Integrity across Internalizing
disorders: A Voxel-Based Meta-Analysis of Fractional Anisotropy.
Objective: White matter (WM) impairments have been identified in numerous mood and anxiety disorders. We aimed to understand the effect
of WM pathology across multiple mood disorders (any mood disorder,
AMD), consistent with the RDoC approach.
Participants and Methods: Web of Science was systematically searched
in September 2014 using terms DTI or diffusion tensor and anxiety
or depress* or bipolar or mania. Inclusion criteria were: original data
from whole brain or whole WM analysis of fractional anisotropy (FA)
in humans aged 18-65, including healthy controls (HCs), reported in
standardized space, in English, in a peer-reviewed journal. We identified
25 AMD studies that used voxel based analysis (12 major depression,
10 bipolar and 3 anxiety disorder) for a total of 761 AMD and 675
HCs. We extracted peak coordinates from each study, then conducted
a meta-analysis using seed-based d Mapping v. 4.13. Jackknife analyses
established reliability.
Results: The AMD group had reduced FA compared to HCs in all 6
clusters. The largest cluster peaked in the left inferior fronto-occipital
fasciculus, and incorporated the corpus callosum, left anterior thalamic
projections, striatum, fronto-orbital polar tract and uncinate fasciculus. The next largest peaked in the left superior longitudinal fasciculus
(SLF) and involved the inferior parietal gyri and arcuate network. The
third largest cluster peaked in the left hemisphere corpus callosum, and
extended to the left SLF and cortico-spinal projections.
Conclusions: We found shared WM pathology across AMD, particularly
in the left hemisphere. Reduced FA occurred in tracts that connect limbic regions including the OFC, amygdala, subcallosal cingulate, hippocampus and hypothalamus, to regions of the PFC involved in inhibitory
control. These results suggest that microstructural WM abnormalities
may underlie a disconnection between frontal, limbic and other regions
that are involved in processing and regulating emotions.

B. CROSSON. Interaction between Age at Diagnosis and Radiation
Therapy is related to Cerebellar Atrophy in Long-Term Survivors
of Pediatric Brain Tumors.
Objective: The cerebellum (CB) helps to automate learned processes
and thus is related indirectly to the speed of processing. The CB often
sustains damage from treatment and resection in patients with posterior
fossa tumors. Researchers have suggested that young age at radiation
treatment is correlated with CB atrophy. The purpose of the study was
to measure cerebellar atrophy to determine its relationship to treatment
factors and speed of processing.
Participants and Methods: Brain MRIs were collected from 25
adult survivors of CB tumors and age and gender matched controls
(M=24 years (SD=5), 52% female). Average age at diagnosis was 9
years (SD=5) and average time since diagnosis was 15 years (SD=5).

Forty Fourth Annual INS Meeting Abstracts
Processing speed (PS) was measured by the Symbol Digit Modality Test.
To quantify atrophy, an objective formula was developed based on prior
literature, in which atrophy = [(CB White+CB Grey Volume)/ Intracranial Vault (ICV)] of controls minus [(CB White+CB Grey+Lesion Size
Volume)/ICV] of survivors.
Results: A three predictor regression model, which included the simultaneous entry of age at diagnosis, presence of radiation, and an interaction
term (age*radiation) as predictors, accounted for 44% of the variance
in cerebellar atrophy, Adj R2=.44, F(3,21)=7.30, p<.01 Presence of
radiation was associated with higher CB atrophy. The interaction term
indicated that for individuals treated with radiation, younger age at diagnosis was associated with higher CB atrophy. An interaction between
atrophy and lesion size also was detected and accounted for 33% of the
variance in oral PS and 48% of the variance in written PS. Both interactions suggest that individuals with smaller CB lesion size but a greater
degree of CB atrophy had slower processing speed, whereas individuals
with a larger CB lesion size and less CB atrophy were less affected.
Conclusions: The results of the current study suggest that young age
at radiation is related to CB atrophy, which negatively impacts PS to a
greater degree than does CB lesion size.

Symposium 10. Risk and Protective Factors for
Outcomes in MS and Sports-Related mTBI
Chair: Peter Arnett

1:00–2:20 p.m.
P. ARNETT, D. UKUEBERUWA, M. CADDEN, J. MEYER &
V.C. MERRITT. Risk and Protective Factors for Outcomes in MS
and Sports-Related mTBI.
Symposium Description: Knowledge of risk and protective factors
for outcomes in neurological conditions can be extremely valuable in
guiding prevention efforts and treatment. An important outcome in
multiple sclerosis (MS) shown to be associated with quality of life and
medication adherence, among other factors, is depression. In sports-related mTBI, important outcomes include post-concussion symptoms and
cognitive functioning, domains that can substantially impact athletes’
daily functioning and readiness to return to play. In this symposium,
we present data from studies on MS and mTBI that examine predictors
of the above outcomes that involve: 1) The evaluation of coping and
cognitive reserve (CR) as moderators of disease burden and depression
in MS; and 2) the evaluation of injury-related variables involving loss
of consciousness (LOC) and amnesia in predicting symptom and neurocognitive profiles in sports-related mTBI. Peter Arnett will begin by
providing a brief overview of the symposium. Dede Ukueberuwa will
then demonstrate that measures of microstructural brain integrity predict depression in MS only when moderated by coping strategies; when
patients have compromised microstructural brain integrity, only those
who use maladaptive coping strategies also show depression. Margaret
Cadden will then review data showing that CR moderates the relationship between MS disability and depression; when patients have high
levels of disability, only those with low levels of CR show significant
depression. Next, Jessica Meyer will present data illustrating that several injury and post-injury variables predict impairments in specific
cognitive domains in mTBI. Finally, Victoria Merritt will demonstrate
that athletes with mTBI’s who experience LOC and PTA have an elevated risk for a range of post-concussion symptoms within two weeks
post-injury. A discussion moderated by Peter Arnett exploring how these
findings might be translated into clinical practice will then ensue.

D. UKUEBERUWA & P. ARNETT. Coping Style is a Protective
Factor for Emotional Consequences of MS Neuropathology.
Objective: In MS, depression symptoms could be a direct consequence of
neurophysiological changes or a secondary consequence of coping with
disability. We hypothesized that white matter microstructural integrity
in regions of interest would interact with coping style to predict depression and, specifically, that greater adaptive coping would be protective
for patients with compromised white matter.
Method: 48 participants (33 female) with MS completed self-report
measures, including the Beck Depression Inventory–Fast Screen
(BDI-FS) and the COPE Inventory, a validated measure with Active
(more adaptive) and Avoidant (less adaptive) coping factors. Participants also completed a diffusion tensor imaging scan, from which voxel-wise fractional anisotropy (FA) was calculated to assess integrity
in these tracts: anterior thalamic radiation, cingulum-cingulate gyrus,
cingulum-hippocampus, inferior frontal-occipital fasciculus and uncinate fasciculus. Separate regression models analyzed the interaction of
regional FA and coping style to predict depression.
Results: Analyses did not indicate a main effect of FA. However, significant regional FA and Active Coping interaction effects for predicting BDI-FS scores were found with the anterior thalamic radiation
(ΔR2=.08, p<.05) and uncinate fasciculus (ΔR2 =.11, p<.05). One
significant interaction of FA and Avoidant Coping was found with the
cingulum-hippocampus (ΔR2=.11, p<.01).
Conclusions: This study demonstrated a protective effect of coping style
in the experience of depression among people with MS who showed
compromised integrity of white matter tracts that connect subcortical
to frontal regions. For patients with decreased integrity of the anterior
thalamic radiation and uncinate fasciculus, use of more Active Coping
strategies was associated with relatively lower depression. Similarly,
use of less Avoidant Coping was associated with lower depression for
patients with decreased integrity of the cingulum-hippocampus.

M. CADDEN & P. ARNETT. Cognitive Reserve Attenuates the
Effect of Disability on Depression in Multiple Sclerosis (MS).
Objective. High education appears to be protective against depression
in healthy adults; theories exploring stress, coping style, and cognitive
resources have been examined with fruitful results. Cognitive reserve, a
construct closely related to education, has been found to attenuate the
impact of brain pathology on daily function. The goal of the current
study was to explore the relationship of cognitive reserve and disability
with depression in a sample of individuals in which brain pathology is
thought to contribute to depression (multiple sclerosis - MS).
Participants and Methods. Fifty-four individuals with MS participating in a neuropsychological research study of MS-related factors
were examined. Depression was measured using the Beck Depression
Inventory-Fast Screen (BDI-FS). Demographic (education) and disease (EDSS) related variables were collected. Cognitive reserve (CR)
was operationalized as the sum years of education and a measure of
crystalized intelligence (Shipley Vocabulary). A regression on BDI-FS
examining CR, EDSS, and their interaction were explored. Models of
mediation were also investigated.
Results. The interaction between EDSS and CR was significant, t(50)
= -2.2, p=.035. Simple effects testing revealed that EDSS predicted
depression in those with low CR, t(50)=2.9 p=.01, but not in those with
high CR (p=.7). Further analyses revealed that the relationship between
CR and depression was mediated, in part, by daily uplifts (The Hassles
and Uplifts Scale) and fluid cognitive skills (Shipley Abstraction). The
relationship was not mediated by daily hassles (The Hassles and Uplifts
Scale) or coping style (The Cope Inventory).
Conclusions. CR moderates the relationship between disability and depression in MS; disability does not appear to predict depression in those
with high CR. The relationship between CR and depression appears to
be mediated, in part, by measures of daily uplifts and fluid processing.

J. MEYER, V.C. MERRITT & P. ARNETT. Risk Factors for DomainSpecific Post-Concussion Cognitive Deficits.
Objective: The idiosyncratic nature of concussive injuries and their recovery trajectories has complicated the development of an expected
profile of post-concussion cognitive functioning. Neuropsychologists
therefore face the difficult task of efficiently evaluating for decline in
all possible cognitive domains. The present study evaluates risk factors
for domain-specific cognitive changes.
Method: 86 participants from a university-based sports concussion program received baseline and post-concussion assessments including both
paper-and-pencil and ImPACT measures. All post-concussion evaluations were performed within 2 weeks post-injury. Three neurocognitive
composite scores (processing speed, verbal memory, visual memory)
were created using Principal Components Analysis and confirmed with
Cronbach’s Alpha. Mean post-concussion performance of athletes who
did or did not report loss of consciousness, and athletes who did or did
not report retrograde amnesia were compared. Comparisons were also
made between athletes who engaged in physical exercise since their
concussion and those who did not.
Results: Loss of consciousness post-concussion (n=19) resulted in
significantly worse performance on tests of verbal memory (t= -2.62,
p=.01). Retrograde amnesia (n=13) resulted in significantly worse performance on tests of visual memory (t= -2.26, p =.026). Athletes who
reported that they engaged in physical activity following their concussion (n=11) performed significantly worse on tests of processing speed
(t=-2.12, p=.039) and verbal memory (t=-2.27, p=.028)
Conclusion: Our findings suggest that evaluation of injury and post-injury information may help to guide the development of expected
post-concussion cognitive profiles. This could help clinicians develop
appropriate individualized test batteries that balance efficiency and
thoroughness. These results further support the recommendation of
physical rest following a concussion.

V.C. MERRITT & P. ARNETT. Relationship Between Traditional
Markers of Injury Severity and Post-Concussion Symptom
Clusters in Concussed Collegiate Athletes.
Objective: Loss of consciousness (LOC) and post-traumatic amnesia
(PTA) are commonly used metrics to classify brain injury severity. However, little is understood regarding how these variables relate to functional outcomes post-injury, especially within the realm of sports-related concussion. The purpose of this study was to determine whether
post-concussion symptom reporting patterns vary as a function of LOC
and PTA.
Participants and Methods: Participants included 84 collegiate athletes
(82.1% male) who were evaluated within two weeks post-injury. The
main outcome measures were the Post-Concussion Symptom Scale
(PCSS) and an interview querying athletes about whether they experienced LOC and PTA.
Results: Dependent variables included four PCSS symptom clusters
(physical, cognitive, affective, and sleep). Athletes were divided into
two groups based on LOC status (21.4% LOC+). Mann-Whitney U
tests revealed significantly higher scores for LOC+ athletes compared
to LOC- athletes on the physical and sleep symptom clusters (all
p<.05). Athletes were also divided into two groups based on PTA status (34.5% PTA+). Mann-Whitney U tests revealed significantly higher
scores for PTA+ athletes compared to PTA- athletes on the physical,
cognitive, and sleep symptom clusters (all p<.05). Finally, logistic regression analyses showed that the four PCSS symptom clusters reliably
distinguished between athletes who did and did not experience LOC
(χ2(4, N=84)=12.03, p=.017, Nagelkerke’s R2=.21) and PTA (χ2(4,
N=84)=10.72, p=.030, Nagelkerke’s R2=.17).

Conclusion: These findings suggest that athletes who experience LOC
and PTA surrounding a concussive event tend to report greater post-concussion symptoms within two weeks post-injury compared to athletes
who do not experience these traditional injury severity markers. Knowledge of such risk factors has implications for the safety and well-being of
athletes, and may inform the management and treatment of sports-related concussions.

Symposium 11. Neurotoxicants and the Etiology of
Neurodevelopmental Disorders:
A Multidisciplinary Approach
Chair: Amy E. Margolis
Discussant: Larry J. Seidman

2:15–3:30 p.m.
A.E. MARGOLIS, V. RAUH & J. HERBSTMAN. Neurotoxicants and
the Etiology of Neurodevelopmental Disorders: A Multidisciplinary
Approach.
Symposium Description: The environment is now known to be a powerful determinant of child health, with increasing evidence that some
chemicals are particularly toxic to the human brain. The developing
brain is particularly vulnerable to toxic chemical exposures and this
sensitivity is likely greatest in utero and throughout early childhood.
Prospective cohort studies incorporating neurodevelopmental outcome
measures provide opportunities to map developmental trajectories. Research showing the effects of exposure to neurotoxicants is critical for
the design of primary prevention programs that can reduce exposure.
In this symposium, we present findings from three studies examining
neurodevelopmental outcomes following exposure to three neurotoxicants: Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs), an air pollutant,
Chlorpyrifos, an organophosphate pesticide, and Polybrominated Diphenyl Ethers (PBDEs), an organobromine compound used as a flame
retardant. Exposure to these neurotoxicants causes damage that may be
apparent in the neonatal period and extending through childhood. Dr.
Margolis will present evidence demonstrating the association between
prenatal exposure to PAH and academic skill acquisition is mediated by
inhibitory control deficits. Dr. Rauh will present evidence that prenatal
exposure to Chlorpyrifos is associated with a unique neuropsychological
profile characterized by impaired auditory attention and fine motor
dexterity. Dr. Herbstmann will present evidence that PBDE exposure
is associated with lowered attention and cognition.

behavior is important for acquisition of academic skills. We investigated
whether prenatal exposure to PAH is associated with inhibitory control
(IC), and whether IC mediated the association of prenatal exposure to
PAH and academic achievement.
Participants and Methods:
Mothers recruited were nonsmoking, aged 18–35, African American or
Dominican, free of diabetes, hypertension, known HIV, and drug abuse.
Personal air sampling was conducted for the mothers for 48 hours at 4
L/min. NEPSY Inhibition measured IC at age 10. Woodcock Johnson
Test of Achievement – 3rd edition measured Reading Achievement (RA)
and Math Achievement (MA) at age 14.
Multivariate linear regression tested associations of prenatal PAH exposure with IC and MA and RA. PAH and IC data were available for
116 children, and 74 children had data available on PAH, IC RA, and
MA. The Sobel test evaluated whether IC mediated prenatal exposure
to PAH and academic achievement. Covariates included were gender,
age at test, maternal education in years, and ethnicity.
Results
Prenatal exposure to PAH was associated with IC, p < .03 and MA, p
< .009. Prenatal exposure to PAH was not associated with RA, p < .5.
IC was associated with MA, p < .002. IC mediated the association of
prenatal exposure to PAH and MA, p <.05.
Conclusion
Prenatal exposure to PAH is associated with poor inhibitory control
at age 10; this deficit is on the causal pathway to problems in math
achievement at age 14. Idiopathic deficits in academic skills may be
attributed to a child’s poor motivation or mis-match between the child
and classroom environment, but the results from this study suggest that
the chemical environment may be an important factor in determining
cognitive development and subsequent academic skill achievement.

Signature Neuropsychological Profile of Children with Prenatal
Exposure to a Common Organophosphate Pesticide.
Objective: Chlorpyrifos (CPF) is known to cross the placenta, posing a
threat to the unborn child during a period of rapid brain development.
Previous studies show cognitive and behavioral deficits in early childhood related to prenatal CPF exposure, across both agricultural and
urban populations. The present study examines whether such deficits
persist into later childhood.
Participants and Methods: We analyzed neuropsychological test data
from 237 children (9-11 years) who are part of a prospective cohort
study of inner-city children, followed since the prenatal period. Participating children had complete data on the following: (1) prenatal
maternal interview; (2) biomarkers of prenatal CPF exposure level
from maternal and/or cord blood samples at delivery; (3) postnatal
covariates; and (4) neuropsychological assessments at 9-11 years. Data
analysis involved data reduction by factor analysis of all neuropsychological measures, followed by linear regression analysis to determine
associations between prenatal CPF exposure and performance on each
neuropsychological domain.
Results: Highly exposed children performed significantly worse than
less exposed children in the domains of sustained auditory attention
(p<0.01) and finger dexterity (p<0.01), as measured by the NEPSY-II.
Highly exposed children showed intact inhibitory control, visual sustained attention, verbal memory and visual memory, revealing a pattern
of better performance on complex versus simple tasks in the presence
of fine motor control deficits.
Conclusions: This signature profile of neuropsychological performance
among children with high prenatal exposure to CPF suggests difficulty
with functions requiring low levels of arousal, and more success with
tasks that require more active engagement, reflecting the effects of their
difficulty sustaining attention. The implications of this profile for academic and social adjustment are discussed.

J. HERBSTMAN & W. COWELL. Prenatal Exposure to Brominated
Flame Retardants (PBDE) and Problems with Attention and
Cognition: Results from a Longitudinal Birth Cohort.
Objective: Polybrominated Diphenyl Ethers (PBDE) are used as flame
retardant chemicals resulting in nearly ubiquitous human exposure.
We investigated whether prenatal exposure to PBDE is associated with
problems with attention and cognition across early childhood.
Participants and Methods: The sample consists of white, black and
Chinese women. 210 Maternal-child pairs were followed through age 7
years. PBDE plasma levels were analyzed by the U.S. Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention. The Child Behavior Checklist was administered
annually between the ages of 3 and 7 years. The Bayley Scales of Infant
Development at ages 1,2, and 3 years and the Wechsler Preschool and
Primary Scale of Intelligence-Revised at 4 and 6 years was used to assess
cognition. We analyzed the association between natural log-transformed
and dichotomized (low vs. high) PBDEs and attention and cognitive
problems using multivariable adjusted regression.
Results: We detected 4 PBDE congeners in more than 50% of samples, with concentrations highest for BDE-47 (median±IQR: 11.2±19.6
ng/g). In adjusted analyses, we detected associations between BDE-47
(1.21, 95% CI: 1.00, 1.47), and BDE-153 (1.18, 95% CI: 1.00, 1.39)
in cord plasma and increased attention problems among children at age
4 (n=109) but not 6 (n=107) years. We detected significant associations for 24-month Mental Development Index (MDI) (BDE-47, 99, and
100), 36-month MDI (BDE-100), 48-month full-scale and verbal IQ
(BDE-47, 99, and 100) and performance IQ (BDE-100), and 72-month
performance IQ (BDE-100).
Conclusions: Our findings demonstrate a positive association between
prenatal PBDE exposure and early childhood attention problems and
cognition, and are consistent with previous research reporting associations between prenatal PBDE exposure and disrupted neurodevelopment.

R.A. BERNIER, A. ROY & F.G. HILLARY. Loss of Long-distance
Functional Connections in Chronic TBI.
Objective: The goal of this study is to examine the influence of time
post injury on functional brain connectivity (FC) in traumatic brain
injury (TBI) many years after recovery. Given growing concern about
neurodegeneration after TBI, we use network theory to examine brain
connectivity with focus on connection strength and distance in neural
networks. We correlate metrics of network connectivity with cognitive
outcome.
Participants and Methods: Participants were 8 individuals with
chronic TBI with moderate and severe injury (24-hour Glasgow Coma
Scale between 3-12, or positive neuroimaging findings, mean 14 years
post injury) and 12 healthy controls (HCs). All data underwent thorough standard preprocessing prior to graph theoretical analysis. Power’s 264 anatomic locations were used for defining regions of interest
(ROIs). For each ROI, we examined the overlap between the TBI and
HC distributions for nodal weight and distance using receiver operator
characteristic (ROC) values.

194
Results: The chronic TBI group demonstrated heightened FC strength
in core subnetworks compared to HCs. However, examining the ROIs
with high ROC values (i.e. 5/264 ROIS) based on the mean physical
distance of edges revealed loss of connection length in 4/5 ROIs in TBI.
ROIs that differentiated individuals with chronic TBI and HCs included
the precuneus BA7, inferior parietal lobule, and superior parietal lobule.
Longer distance was observed in superior frontal region (BA10). After
controlling for gray matter volume, time post injury was correlated
with connection-distance gain in frontal connections, but distance-connectivity loss in posterior regions (e.g., parietal, precuneus). Loss of
longer distance connections in the precuneus, and inferior and superior
parietal lobules was significantly associated with decreased performance
on several cognitive tests.
Conclusions: These results show that connectivity is associated with
time post injury, where posterior connections are lost while frontal connections are maintained or even enhanced.

L.D. DRISKELL, J.S. LINK, J. MESSERLY, M. PINJALA, D. AMEN
& C. GOLDEN. The Relationship Between Somatic Symptoms and
Regional Cerebral Blood Flow in Individuals with Generalized
Anxiety Disorder.
Objective: The current study sought to assess the differences in regional
cerebral blood flow (rCBF) between individuals with generalized anxiety
disorder (GAD) who scored in the upper and lower quartiles of somatic
anxiety symptomology.
Participants and Methods: Participants diagnosed with GAD were
selected from a large de-identified ongoing database. Then, separated
into quartiles (lower 25th [n=1,053]; upper 75th [n=1,008]) based
upon their scores on a self-report scale measuring somatic anxiety symptomatology (e.g., appetite changes, muscle tension, heart rate, trouble
breathing, faintness, nausea, sweating, hot flashes, headaches). Participants were made up of 56.3% males and 43.6% females, and had a
mean age of 38.31 years (SD= 14.77).
Results: A MANOVA was conducted at the .05 level for Baseline
measures and for Concentration measures (data acquired while clients completed the Conners CPT 3). Both Baseline (Wilks’ λ=.974;
F(17, 1777)=2.831, p=.000) and Concentration (Wilks’ λ=.965; F(17,
1970)=4.235, p=.000) MANOVA’s provided significant differences between the upper and lower quartiles of the clients with somatic anxiety
symptoms. Individuals in the upper quartile yielded significantly greater
amounts of rCBF relative to the lower quartile for both Baseline and
Concentration in the following areas: bilateral limbic structures, bilateral basal ganglia, and the vermis.
Conclusions: These results indicate that at rest, and during a task that
requires concentration, the physiological symptoms associated with anxiety may be dictated by hyper-perfusion in the subcortical regions such
as the thalamus, amygdala, fornix, striatum, globus pallidus, substantia
nigra, and nucleus accumbens. These findings support the current literature on the limbic and basal ganglia regions. The hyper-perfusion of
the vermis may be due to proprioceptive information received via the
spinocerebellar tract. Lastly, these findings indicate neurological differences between individuals with GAD that experience somatic symptoms

J.C. DUPERROUZEL, A.R. LAIRD, M. SUTHERLAND, J.M. ROSS
& R. GONZALEZ. Functional Neuroimaging Consensus
Regarding Executive Function Alterations Among Cannabis Using
Adolescents and Young Adults.
Objective: A growing body of neuroimaging studies has identified
functional brain abnormalities among young and heavy cannabis users.

Although single neuroimaging studies are essential for delineating the
neurobiological impact of cannabis on the developing brain, modern
meta-analytic tools for functional neuroimaging data have not yet been
applied to identify consensus across studies. Here, we meta-analyzed
findings from fMRI studies characterizing differences between cannabis
using adolescents/young adults and healthy controls during executive
function task performance.
Participants and Methods: We conducted a meta-analysis of adolescent/young adult fMRI studies within the activation likelihood estimation (ALE) framework (19 studies). We excluded studies whose
participants had neurological confounds, met abuse or dependence for
substances other than nicotine or cannabis, and had a mean age greater
than 26 years. All coordinate foci were converted to Talairach space
and the ALE meta-analysis was performed via BrainMap’s GingerALE
software (P<0.05, FWE corrected).
Results: ALE meta-analysis was performed for coordinates reporting
brain between-group differences in adolescent/young adult cannabis
users and healthy participants during executive function tasks. Convergence in hyperactivation was observed in numerous frontal structures
in cannabis users when compared to matched-controls. Specifically,
convergence was observed in the precentral, medial, and superior frontal
gyrus, as well as the insula.
Conclusions: The effects of acute cannabis administration on the brain
are known to alter cognitive abilities. In the present meta-analysis, cannabis users demonstrated greater activation that converged within insula and medial frontal gyrus, indicating alterations within the salience
network (Seely et. al 2007). These findings suggest reports of poorer
executive function among young cannabis users may be due to difficulty disengaging neural systems that are task irrelevant and failure to
generate appropriate behavioral responses.

Early Life Trauma Impairs Sustained Attention Ability and Alters
Functional Connectivity in OEF/OIF/OND Veterans.
Objective: Early life trauma (ELT) is known to impact cognitive processing abilities in tasks involving emotional stimuli, but the cognitive
and neural mechanisms of how ELT impacts neuropsychological functioning in non-emotional contexts remains incompletely characterized.
The present study examined how ELT impacts performance and neural
functioning on a non-emotional sustained attention task.
Participants and Methods: Sixty-six veterans from the Translational
Research Center for TBI and Stress Disorders (VA Boston Healthcare
system) were assessed for ELT and performed the gradual onset continuous performance task (gradCPT, go/no-go CPT) while in the MRI
scanner.
Results: Behavioral results show reduced sustained attention ability
in veterans with ELT, as indexed by lower d’ values (p=0.003), higher
errors rates (p=0.001), greater increases in error rates over the duration of the block (p=0.001), and increased reaction time variability
(p=0.02). Using anatomically defined amygdala ROIs, we conducted
whole-brain functional connectivity analyses on the time series during
the task block as well as a resting-state run collected during the same
scanning session. Results showed increases in functional connectivity
between the amygdala and the right middle frontal gyrus for veterans
with ELT compared to those without ELT and the strength of connectivity between these regions was correlated with task performance (d’).
Interestingly, group-level differences in connectivity were only observed
during the sustained attention task and not during the resting-state
scan, suggesting that group differences may only be present during
attention-demanding tasks.
Conclusions: These results suggest that ELT is associated with reduced sustained attention ability in non-emotional contexts in adulthood, which may result from dysfunctional communication between (or

interference from) emotional processing in the amygdala and prefrontal
cognitive control areas.

A. GARCIA, T. SEIDER, E. PORGES & R.A. COHEN. The
Relationship between DMN Activation and Intelligence in Older
Adults.
Objective: The Default Mode Network (DMN) of the brain has been
described as a network that is most active when the brain is at rest.
Studies of the DMN in older adults suggest alterations in both activation
and connectivity. The current study aimed to examine DMN activation
in older adults during a task of visual memory, specifically during the
interstimulus interval. Activation during this period was then correlated
with cognitive variables. We hypothesized that greater “off-task” DMN
activation would be positively correlated with cognition.
Participants and Methods: Sixty nine older adults (M age = 73)
completed the NIH toolbox cognitive battery as well as an fMRI visual
memory task.
Results: As expected, a whole brain t-test revealed significant activation
of traditional default mode network regions, including medial prefrontal
cortex (MPFC), posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), and both left and
right posterior perisylvian cortex (PPS), while off-task. Contrary to
our hypothesis, greater activation of the PCC significantly negatively
correlated with NIH Toolbox Crystalized Intelligence (R = -.267, p <
.05) and NIH Toolbox Fluid Intelligence measures (R = -.37, p < .05).
No other areas of activation were significantly correlated with cognitive
variables.
Conclusions: In line with previous findings, older adults engage the
DMN while off-task. However, those with higher performance on measures of intelligence had less PCC activation. This finding suggests that
both intelligent and cognitively intact individuals remained engaged in
the task even during “rest” periods.

G.H. BRODY & L.H. SWEET. Substance Use Effects and Insula
Response during a functional MRI Working Memory Task in Rural
African Americans.
Objective: Rural African American populations experience disproportionately high levels of chronic stress. This has been associated with
increased risk behavior, including substance use, which has in turn
been linked to changes in brain regions associated with working memory (WM). As it has not previously been reported we examined this
relationship in this high-risk population.
Participants and Methods: Functional MRI data associated with performance on an n-Back WM paradigm were analyzed among 25 rural
African American males (mean age=23.0 years, SD=0.867) reporting
frequency of substance use over the past year. MR data were acquired
on a GE 3T MRI using a BOLD echoplanar sequence. General linear
modeling was used to quantify individual 2-Back response relative to a
0-Back control condition. Whole-brain voxel-wise analyses were used
to determine group level activation patterns (p<.05, FDR corrected),
followed by functional region of interest group contrasts.
Results: Consistent with prior literature, the voxel-wise analysis revealed greater activity in bilateral middle frontal gyrus and inferior
parietal lobule, and relative deactivation in the medial frontal gyrus and
posterior cingulate. Unexpected activation of the bilateral anterior insula
was examined given prior literature suggesting associations between
this region and substance use. Independent-samples t-tests revealed
that individuals in a frequent substance use group exhibit significantly
lower insula activation (right: t=.2.14, p=.043/left: t=2.19, p=.039), despite similar behavioral performance (2-Back accuracy t=1.09, p=.285;

195
0-Back accuracy t=1.67, p=.125; 2-Back reaction time t=-.77, p=.499;
0-Back reaction time t=-.56, p=.583).
Conclusions: Our results provide objective neuroimaging evidence of a
link between the insula and substance use in young rural African Americans when challenged with a difficult WM task. Results are discussed
as they relate to chronic stress in rural African Americans and whether
this may be a marker or consequence of substance use.

N. HOSSEINI-KAMKAR. The Neural Correlates of Cognitive and
Behavioral Self-Regulation in Preadolescents: A Multidisciplinary
Approach.
Objective: Cognitive and behavioral self-regulation (CBSR) is the capacity to select actions that lead to favorable outcomes and avoid actions
that lead to unfavorable outcomes. Variability in self-regulation early
in childhood predicts social, academic, and health outcomes in adolescence (Mischel & Underwood, 1974). We aim to investigate factors
that contribute to individual variability in CBSR early in development.
Our hypothesis is that genes and the quality of the early environment
have an interactive influence on the calibration of the mesocorticolimbic dopamine pathway (MCLP). In turn, variability in the functional
calibration of the MCLP contributes to individual differences in CBSR.
Participants and Methods: To investigate this hypothesis, genetic,
behavioral, brain imaging (fMRI), and questionnaire data were collected
from typically developing 9-12 year old children. The fMRI protocol
consisted of an instrumental learning task in which participants were
presented with pairs of neutral images and were required to learn to
select the stimuli associated with gains and avoid the stimuli associated
with losses.
Results: Results confirm that the task engages the basal ganglia and
will be a useful tool in investigating the functional calibration of the
MCLP. Greater blood-oxygen-level dependent (BOLD) responses in
ventral striatum (VS) and ventromedial prefrontal cortex (VMPFC)
were found when participants received rewards compared to when they
missed out on an opportunity to receive rewards. In contrast, greater
BOLD responses in anterior insula (AI) and anterior cingulate cortex
(ACC) were found when participants received losses compared to when
they avoided losing.
Conclusions: The strength the current research project is that it interrogate CBSR at multiple levels of analysis, and the goal of this presentation
is to summarize the rationale behind each level of phenotypic analysis
(behavioral, neural, genetic, and environmental) and to present neuroimaging results from this multidisciplinary project.

Correlates and Predictors of Infant Social-Emotional Development
Explored with Functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy.
Objective: Identifying early indicators for cognitive and social problems
is essential for earliest intervention. The advent of neuroimaging technologies for infants, such as fNIRS, has made identifying early neural
markers for typical/aberrant neurodevelopment possible. Because eye
gaze processing may be the most rudimentary skill in nonverbal social development, this study examined the hemodynamic response of
9-month-olds while processing social and nonsocial gaze stimuli and
tested how these neural correlates relate to cognition and behavior.
Participants and Methods: Fourteen typically-developing infants
(Mage=40.86 (1.47) weeks) underwent fNIRS while engaged in gaze
shifts to social and nonsocial stimuli. Kendall tau was used to examine
the relationships between brain activation, cognitive testing, (Mullen
Scales of Early Learning [MSEL]) and infant behaviors (Infant Behavior

196
Questionnaire–Revised [IBQ-R]; Brief Infant Toddler Social and Emotional Assessment [BITSEA]) at 9 and 12 mos.
Results: Frontal activation during the social tasks was related to higher
levels of visual reception, fine motor, and receptive language on the
MSEL at 9-mos (τs= .59, .59, .46, ps<.05, respectively). Higher right
temporo-parietal (RTP) activation during averted gaze processing was
associated with lower duration of orientation, decreased emotion regulation on the IBQ-R at 9-mos and lower social competency on the BITSEA
at 12-mos (τs= -.57, -.73, respectively; ps<.05).
Conclusions: Findings demonstrate a relationship between social and
higher-order cognitive processing supported by frontal regions, even
early in development. Enhanced activation during averted gaze processing in RTP regions at 9 mos may reflect delayed development and/
or compensation by early social communication networks. The fact that
duration of orientation and social competency were associated with common activation patterns suggests that they share similar substrates in
infancy, and supports the study of gaze processing as an early precursor
for later social adaptability.

J.E. LETZEN & M.E. ROBINSON. Functional Connectivity of the
Default Mode Network Under Different Mood States.
Objective: Altered default mode network (DMN) functional connectivity (fcMRI) has been proposed as a neural marker for numerous clinical
conditions, including chronic pain. State-dependent factors that might
influence or confound conclusions about DMN fcMRI as a marker have
not been thoroughly tested, even within healthy individuals, which often
act as a control for drawing such conclusions. This study’s objective was
to measure DMN fcMRI in healthy individuals under different mood
states.
Participants and Methods: Fifteen participants completed four resting-state fMRI scans. A mood induction occurred before the second and
fourth scans. For the inductions, participants recounted happy and sad
autobiographical events while listening to music. The sad autobiographical event was specific to a time when acute pain caused sadness. Mood
ratings were collected before and after each scan and induction.
Results: Following respective mood inductions, participants reported
happy (μ= 74.3, SD = 74.3) or sad (μ= 32.2, SD = 32.2) mood. FCMRI was calculated using bivariate correlations to a key DMN hub [i.e.
medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC)]. The DMN was identified across all
mood states. Comparing sad to neutral mood, participants had increased
DMN fcMRI with pain-related brain regions, such as postcentral gyrus,
insular cortex, and fusiform gyrus [t(14) = 8.14, pFDR < .000]. Happy
DMN did not significantly differ from neutral DMN. Comparing sad and
happy mood states, increased DMN fcMRI was observed to the frontal
pole, fusiform gyrus, and postcentral gyrus [t(14) = 6.56, pFDR < .000].
Conclusions: Sad, but not happy, mood states influenced DMN fcMRI,
which has implications for use of this network as a marker across clinical
disorders. Specifically, the utility of the DMN as a marker for chronic
pain is questionable, given the increased DMN fcMRI to pain-related
regions after pain-specific sad mood induction. Future work is needed
to determine the specificity of mood vs. nociceptive influences on the
DMN in chronic pain.

G.J. HARRIS, D.A. GANSLER & M. OSCAR-BERMAN. Functional
Connectivity in Long-Term Abstinent Alcoholics.
Objective: Research on functional connectivity magnetic resonance
imaging (fcMRI) in long-term abstinent alcoholics (LTAA) has found
abnormal synchrony in the reward network compared to nonalcoholic
controls (NC). To date, only fcMRI studies involving recently abstinent

alcoholics (<6 months) have examined synchrony outside of the reward
network. This study’s objective was to compare network synchrony
between LTAA and NC using a whole-brain analysis. We predicted
that LTAA would demonstrate abnormal synchrony compared to NC in
four brain networks vulnerable to alcoholism (default-mode, salience,
executive-control, and reward).
Participants and Methods: Functional and structural MRI scans were
obtained on a 3T scanner from a sample of 31 LTAA and 34 demographically similar NC. An independent component analysis (ICA) was
performed using FSL’s MELODIC program. Dual regression was used to
identify between-group differences in synchrony levels. Threshold-free
cluster enhancement was used to correct for multiple comparisons.
Significant clusters are reported for regions where synchrony differed
between groups.
Results: The ICA decomposition resulted in 34 components and revealed 20 networks. Between-group differences were found in the four
a priori networks, and none of the other 16 comparisons. LTAA showed
significantly reduced synchrony in the default-mode network involving
the putamen and posterior cingulate cortex. LTAA showed significantly
increased synchrony in (1) the salience network involving the supramarginal gyrus, cuneus, and supplementary motor area, (2) the executive
control network involving the supramarginal gyrus, and (3) the insula
of the reward network.
Conclusions: Alcoholism related synchrony anomalies are restricted to
brain networks involving self-representation and higher-order aspects of
cognition. The inter-relationship of synchrony anomalies of these reciprocal networks, and their relationship to subject variables representing
the pathology of alcoholism will be further explored.

Survey of Clinical Language fMRI Use in Epilepsy in 2015.
Objective: Clinical functional MRI is widely used for pre-surgical evaluation of language, and at many sites has largely replaced Wada testing
for this purpose. In spite of this, relatively little is known about actual
implementation of fMRI in the clinic, and anecdotally there is marked
variation in fMRI methodology between sites. The aim of this study was
to document how epilepsy programs currently use fMRI in evaluating
patients for epilepsy surgery.
Participants and Methods: Through email and phone, we contacted
all level 3 and 4 epilepsy programs within the US via the membership
directory of the National Association of Epilepsy Centers, and sites
beyond the US via a snowball strategy. Measures included an online
two-part surey: (i) fMRI use and relationship to surgical outcomes, and
(ii) technical questions regarding language fMRI paradigms, processing
and reporting procedures. We report initial data from 51 clinicians
involved in patient selection for surgery and 35 individuals acquiring
and analyzing clinical fMRI data.
Results: In mapping language presurgically, patients most frequently
received neuropsychological assessment (on average 90% of patients),
fMRI (55%), and Wada testing (36%). Of those using fMRI routinely,
100% used language fMRI to determine the dominant hemisphere, while
36% used fMRI to guide surgical margins. Clinical respondents at seven
sites reported at least one patient had suffered an enduring (>3 month)
postoperative language deficit in spite of preserving all fMRI-positive
language sites. More than 16 different paradigms were routinely used to
map language, most commonly letter-prompted word generation. Training of those conducting clinical fMRI varies markedly between sites.
Conclusions: Epilepsy programs routinely use language fMRI to lateralize but not localize language. The relationship between fMRI activation
and clinical outcome is variable and likely relates to significant technical
variation in fMRI use.

A.E. MARGOLIS, G. TAU, L.S. PAO & R. MARSH. Using
Neuroimaging to Understand Brain-Behavioral Associations
During Cognitive Control.
Objective: Disturbances in cognitive control are central to many neurodevelopmental disorders. Attention Deficit / Hyperactivity Disorder
(ADHD) is characterized by inattention and impulsivity, and healthy
children and their caregivers may report a range of subclinical symptoms. We used the Simon Spatial Incompatibility Task (Simon task)
and fMRI to assess the neural correlates of cognitive control in children.
We also examined brain-behavior associations between neural activity
during cognitive control and reported attention problems.
Participants and Methods: We collected FMRI data during performance of the Simon task from 55 healthy children (7-22 years) and
ADHD symptom scale from 39 of these children. We assessed the association of age and number of ADHD symptoms with brain activation
during resolution of cognitive conflict (correct responses to conflict
versus non-conflict trials).
Results: Across conflict trials, age was inversely associated with reaction
time (p < 0.001), and positively associated with brain activation in
bilateral inferior and middle frontal gyri. Number of ADHD symptoms
was positively associated with activation in left inferior frontal gyrus,
caudate, insula, and bilateral anterior cingulate cortices.
Conclusions: We have identified several brain-behavior relationships
associated with cognitive control and ADHD symptoms. With increasing
age, response times decreased and activation in inferior frontal regions
increased during resolution of conflict, suggesting greater activation in
frontal cortices supports more efficient resolution of conflict. Activation
in regions required for resolution of conflict increased with increasing
number of ADHD symptoms, suggesting greater activation is required to
accomplish cognitive control in individuals with weaker self-regulation.
These findings demonstrate the value of studying the neural correlates of
trans-diagnostic neuropsychological behaviors in healthy development.

K. MCWILLIAMS, K. OSIPOWICZ & J. WILLIAMS. The Effects
of Emotion on Visual Memory Processing Network Connectivity.
Objective: Past research has found the amygdala to have a modulating effect on the hippocampal complex and cortical regions during
emotional memory encoding, however a fully constructed network of
emotional memory processing has yet to be identified. Our goal was to
support the existence of such a network and to show its connections are
modified by emotional salience.
Participants and Methods: The present study used functional connectivity magnetic resonance imaging (fcMRI) to examine the interactions of a 9 node emotional memory system during the processing of
neutral and emotional visual stimuli by 21 one neurologically normal
individuals.
Results: Contrary to our hypothesis, spectral autoregressive multivariate granger causality modeling revealed that a visual emotional memory
network, composed of the Associative Visual Cortex Visual Cortex, Inferior Temporal Gyrus, Middle Temporal Gyrus, Primary Visual Cortex,
Fusiform gyrus, Somatosensory Association Cortex, Entorhinal Cortex,
Parahippocampal cortex, Hippocampus and Amygdala, does not exist.
The suggested network was found to be the more robust during neutral
encoding than emotional encoding and the least robust during rest.
Conclusions: These results do not support amygdalar modulation theories; rather they reflect neuroanatomical findings that separate emotion
and memory into two distinct networks. The decreased synchronicity
seen during emotional memory encoding may reflect phenomenons like
the weapons focus effect, attentional window and flashbulb memories,
whereby the memory is recollected with great ease and vividness, but

197
the contextual details are limited and often inaccurate. From a broader
view, these findings highlight the need for network connectivity analyses in the examination of emotional memory effects and processing,
since they conflict with the majority of results from previous modular
analyses of fMRI data.

C. PRICE. Functional Connectivity of the Frontoparietal Network
as a Predictor of Working Memory Performance.
Objective: Regions in the frontal and parietal cortices constitute a specialized functional network supporting working memory processes. The
functional connectivity of this frontoparietal network (FPN), as assessed
using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI),
may be important in predicting working memory ability. It was hypothesized that greater functional connectivity would correspond with
better working memory.
Participants and Methods: A prospective correlation design was used
on 22 non-demented older adults. Participants completed measures of
working memory and underwent neuroimaging (T1 and rs-fMRI). Participants also completed a visuospatial line discrimination task (JLO) to
provide a functional dissociation from working memory tasks.
Results: FPN functional connectivity had significant negative correlation with performance on the spatial span backwards task, r(20) =
-.50, p = .02. FPN did not correlate with performance on the JLO task.
Conclusions: Overall, the current results provide support that FPN
connectivity is related to working memory performance, although the
directionality of this was in the opposite direction as hypothesized.
Reduced connectivity at rest may represent improved efficiency and
better ability to recruit resources during actual task engagement. Further studies are needed to clarify the role and significance of functional
connectivity and cognitive function.

Gaze Processing in 9 Month Old Infants: A fNIRS Study.
Objective: Infant eye gaze processing is pertinent to later development
of joint attention, nonverbal social communication, and possibly theory
of mind, making research on the identification of early neural correlates
critical. This study examined the hemodynamic response of typically
developing (TD) infants as they attended to social (mutual/averted) and
nonsocial stimuli using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS).
The medial prefrontal cortex and right temporo-parietal cortices are
associated with social cognition (Grossman et al, 2010; Lloyd-Fox et
al, 2015). We hypothesized that infants would: 1) demonstrate higher
frontal activation while attending to mutual compared to averted gaze
or nonsocial stimuli, and 2) exhibit increased activation in temporo-parietal regions (Right > Left) during social compared to nonsocial stimuli.
Participants and Methods: Fourteen TD infants (MAge = 40.86 (1.47)
weeks) underwent fNIRS while engaged in a paradigm requiring eye
gaze shifts between social and nonsocial stimuli. A series of paired t-tests
were performed to examine task by brain region of interest differences.
Results: Contrary to existing preliminary research, there were no significant differences in frontal activation between social and nonsocial
conditions. The highest mean activation occurred during the averted
condition in bilateral temporo-parietal regions (m [ΔHbO]right =
0.0306; m [ΔHb0]left = 0.0297). Significantly higher activation was
noted during the social (averted) compared to nonsocial condition in
right temporo-parietal regions (p < 0.01).
Conclusions: First, we can distinguish social from nonsocial correlates
in 9-month olds using fNIRS. Second, our finding indicates the importance of bilateral temporo-parietal regions in processing shifts in eye

198
gaze in early development and suggest that 9 months may be when social
attention begins to lateralize to the right hemisphere consistent with the
emergence of joint attention.

default mode network after total knee replacement surgery.
Objective: Cognitive changes can occur after major surgery, especially
in the elderly. Research examining cognitive changes post surgery suggest memory/learning and executive domains to be most vulnerable to
change; other domains (i.e. language and motor performance) are not
affected. The etiology of these changes is to be determined; theories of
cerebral reserve and current research suggest there may be predictors
for cognitive changes after surgery, specifically, baseline cognitive performance. We examined the ability of individual indices of cognition to
predict pre- to post-surgery reductions in Default Mode Network (DMN)
in older adults electing knee replacement surgery.
Participants and Methods: Thirty-five non-demented older adults
(age: 70 ± 7.62) completed a baseline neuropsychological assessment
and pre- and 48 hours post-surgery structural and functional MRI.
Indices hypothesized to be predictive of change were analyzed as predictors while indices that were not expected to predict change (e.g. language) were analyzed to demonstrate a dissociation. Regression analyses
controlled for age, pain severity, and medication status. Independent
component analysis identified DMN. Zero-lag cross correlation assessed
changes in functional connectivity pre- and post-surgery.
Results: Pre-surgery working memory, verbal memory and reasoning
composites predicted change in DMN post-surgically such that those
who performed more poorly had greater changes in DMN from pre- to
post-surgery ([working memory: R2= 0.19; β= -0.36, p= 0.03], [verbal
memory: R2= 0.20 ; β= -0.37, p= 0.02], [reasoning: R2= 0.22; β= -0.39,
p= 0.02]). Indices not expected to be predictive of change, language and
motor speed, were not significant predictors.
Conclusions: Baseline cognitive performance, specifically, working
memory, reasoning and verbal memory indices, predicted decreases in
DMN at the post surgical time point in older adults. The study is ongoing. Findings have clinical implications for medical decision-making.

Objective: Several functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies have analyzed the famous name discrimination task (FNDT), an
uncontrolled semantic memory probe requiring discrimination between
famous and unfamiliar individuals. Completion of this simple familiarity
task recruits a semantic memory network with considerable overlap
with the default mode network. Specific semantic memory probes using biographical information associated with famous individuals may
build on previous findings and yield a more robust analysis of semantic
memory systems.
Participants and Methods: Sixteen cognitively intact elders completed
the FNDT and two novel tasks during fMRI: Categories (matching famous individuals to occupational categories) and Attributes (matching
famous individuals to specific bodies of work or life events).
Results: Relative to their respective control tasks, participants recruited
brain regions for all three tasks consistent with previous research, including left temporal lobe, left angular gyrus, precuneus, posterior cingulate, and anterior cingulate. Cross-task comparisons revealed that

FNDT generated significantly more activity than the other tasks in
anterior cingulate and several posterior regions. Categories had significantly reduced activity compared to the other tasks in inferior parietal
lobe, precuneus, and posterior cingulate. Attributes, the most specific
semantic memory probe, demonstrated the strongest left lateralization
with significantly greater activity in left inferior frontal gyrus and left
anterior temporal lobe.
Conclusions: This study identified neural correlates of different levels
of semantic processing associated with famous names. The FNDT, an
uncontrolled probe, demonstrated greater activity across most regions.
The Attributes task, which probed for specific semantic memories, had
more focused activity in the left hemisphere, including anterior temporal
lobe and inferior frontal gyrus.

L. ZAJAC & R. KILLIANY. Brain Networks Involved in the
Aesthetic Judgment of Visual Stimuli.
Objective: To test the hypothesis that functional activity and connectivity in the human brain differ during aesthetic judgment (AJ) versus
passive viewing (PV) of the same set of paintings.
Participants and Methods: fMRI data was collected from 12 healthy
subjects using a block design. In the first 4 runs (PV), subjects passively
viewed each painting. In the second 4 runs (AJ), subjects were shown
the same set of paintings and judged whether they found each painting
aesthetically pleasing. Painting and condition order was the same for
all subjects.
We performed two types of analyses using FEAT in FSL. The first
showed activity in AJ>PV and PV>AJ. The second was a psychophysiological interactions (PPI) analysis, which showed functional connectivity differences between the paracingulate (PC) cortex and the rest of
the brain in AJ>PV and PV>AJ. We chose the PC because it has been
implicated in decision-making and attention to subjective emotional
responses and a large and highly significant cluster in the AJ>PV results
was localized there.
Results: AJ>PV revealed activation in the bilateral PC, anterior and
posterior cingulate, insula, thalamus, and middle frontal gyri. PV>AJ
revealed activation in the bilateral ventromedial prefrontal cortices,
angular gyri, posterior cingulate, superior temporal gyri, left middle
temporal gyrus, left lateral occipital cortex, right precentral gyrus, and
right superior parietal lobule.
PPI results showed increased functional connectivity between the right
PC and right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in AJ>PV and no significant
results for the left PC. In PV>AJ, increased functional connectivity was
revealed between the right and left PC and primarily the bilateral posterior cingulate, precuneus, and juxtapositional lobule cortex.
Conclusions: Different sets of brain regions are active when forming
aesthetic opinions of visual stimuli compared to passively viewing them,
and the strength of functional connections between the PC and the rest
of the brain depend on task conditions.

M.J. MELOY & C.E. WIERENGA. Interactive Effects of APOE
Genotype And Cognition on Brain Perfusion in Normal Aging And
Mild Cognitive Impairment.
Objective: Normal aging is associated with decrements in cognitive
function and changes in cerebral blood flow (CBF), which have been
associated with increased risk for mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and
Alzheimer’s disease (AD). This study used arterial spin labeling MRI
to investigate if the relationship between CBF and cognitive functions

Forty Fourth Annual INS Meeting Abstracts
was modified by apolipoprotein (APOE) genotype, a known risk factor
for AD, in normal cognitive (NC) aging and in individuals with MCI.
Participants and Methods: 80 community-dwelling older adults
(mean age=74.5, SD=7.3) participated. 57 had NC and 23 had MCI
based on comprehensive diagnosis from neuropsychological testing. Linear mixed effect models investigated the voxel-wise relationship between
cognition (memory and executive function composites) and resting CBF,
and the interactive effects of cognition and APOE genotype on CBF
(adjusting for age) separately for NC and MCI.
Results: Spatial correspondence between CBF and cognitive composites
was found in MCI in several brain regions, with weaker associations
within the NC group (corrected p<.01). Cognitive composites had differential effects on voxel-wise resting CBF as a function of APOE genotype.
These interactive effects were characterized by negative associations
between CBF and memory/executive functions in NC APOE ε4 carriers
(B=-10.7, p<.01), which was not the case for ε3 carriers. In MCI, there
were positive associations between CBF and memory/executive functions in APOE ε3 carriers (B=7.3, p<.01), with a significant negative
CBF/memory correlation for ε4 carriers (B=-3.2, p=.02).
Conclusions: Results suggest that for those in the NC group who carry
the ε4 allele, higher CBF is associated with worse performance on executive and memory tasks, perhaps reflecting dysregulation within the
neurovascular unit. Within the MCI group however, carrying the ε3
allele seemed to serve a compensatory role, with increased CBF supporting better memory and executive functions while ε4 was associated
with worse memory performance.

W.D. KILLGORE. Baseline Responsiveness of the Ventral Striatum
Predicts Overeating During Subsequent Sleep Deprivation.
Objective: Insufficient sleep contributes to weight gain through several
mechanisms, including alterations in appetite-regulating hormones, increased hunger, and increased fat and carbohydrate intake. In addition
to altered physiological responses, sleep deprivation (SD) may also affect
food intake by altering the functioning of the reward and behavioral
control regions of the brain. We hypothesized that some individuals
might show greater vulnerability to sleep loss-induced overeating that
would be related to baseline differences in the functional responses of
reward anticipation regions of the brain (e.g., ventral striatum).
Participants and Methods: Thirty healthy participants (15 males)
aged 20-43 years completed a series of functional magnetic resonance
imaging (fMRI) scans at rested baseline, including the multi-source
interference test (MSIT) and n-back tasks, which measure executive
functioning and working memory, respectively. Later that same week,
each participant completed a 28-hour period of total SD, during which
they were given ad libitum access to 10,500 kcal of food to consume
throughout the overnight SD session. fMRI brain responses were used
to predict subsequent food consumption, appetite, and hunger ratings
during each third of the session using SPM8 (p<.001).
Results: Functional activation within the ventral striatum at rested
baseline, particularly the nucleus accumbens, was positively correlated
with total kcals consumed during the period of sleep deprivation, but
only for the final third of the overnight session (i.e., 6 a.m. to noon).
This was observed for the MSIT (R2 = .45) as well as the n-back task
(R2 = .57).
Conclusions: Prior research suggests that SD is associated with downregulation of dopamine D2 receptors in the ventral striatum. Our findings suggest that individual differences in the responsiveness of the
ventral striatum at baseline may confer some resistance to this downregulation during SD, leading to a greater propensity for such individuals
to overeat when sleep is lacking.

W.D. KILLGORE & L.D. NICKERSON. Predicting Resistance to
Sleep Deprivation using Multimodal Neuroimaging.
Objective: Some people are more resistant to the adverse cognitive
effects of sleep deprivation (SD) than others, but the specific brain
systems underling this capacity remain relatively unexplored. Here, we
used multimodal brain imaging with a novel data fusion technique to
predict Resistance to SD.
Participants and Methods: A sample of forty-six healthy adults (23
male, 23 female; age: 20 to 43 years) underwent several neuroimaging scans at 3T, including task-based functional magnetic resonance
imaging (fMRI), structural MRI, and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI).
Later that same week, participants returned for a 28-hour SD session,
with hourly performance monitoring (psychomotor vigilance test; PVT)
across the SD session as a metric of Resistance. Data fusion of gray
matter and white matter structural imaging and functional neuroimaging modalities was conducted using linked independent components
analysis (LICA), and then regressed against Resistance scores.
Results: The LICA revealed a component that was significantly predictive (r = .48, p = .003) of Resistance to sleep deprivation. This component comprised four primary brain features: 1) greater fractional
anisotropy (44%) and 2) reduced mean diffusivity (31%) throughout
the brain, 3) increased functional activation within a fronto-parietal attention network during task fMRI, and 4) increased gray matter volume
within left frontal and parietal regions and brainstem (3%).
Conclusions: Using multimodal neuroimaging and data fusion, the
present findings suggest a core set of brain networks associated with
the unique capacity to resist SD. These findings suggest that the ability
to resist SD is associated with greater integrity of white matter axonal
tracts and increased neural efficiency within a left lateralized fronto-parietal attention network. Future work may build upon this foundation to
identify methods for enhancing the functioning of this system to sustain
resistance capacity.

Prefrontal GABA Correlates with the Ability to Sustain Vigilance
During Sleep Deprivation.
Objective: The ability to sustain vigilance in the face of prolonged
sleep deprivation appears to be stable and trait-like, but the neurobiological underpinnings of this capacity remain unknown. One possible
mechanism for this capacity may be the inhibitory neurotransmitter
gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), which has been implicated in sleep
regulation. Here we used magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) to
examine brain GABA within the medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) as a
potential predictor of resistance to sleep deprivation.
Participants and Methods: Twenty healthy adult men and 20 women
underwent MRS at 3T. Proton metabolite data were acquired using
MEGAPRESS from the MPFC, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC),
and occipital lobe (OCC). MRS and cognitive functioning data were acquired prior to a 30-hour sleep deprivation challenge. Resistance to sleep
deprivation was determined using a 10-minute Psychomotor Vigilance
Test (PVT), acquired hourly during the deprivation challenge. PVT data
were analyzed as speed [(1/RT)*1000], normalized as a percentage of
baseline from the first three administrations.
Results: A significant decline in PVT performance was observed during
sleep deprivation, with similar decrements observed across sexes: men
performed at 86.5% and women at 84.9% of baseline (pre-deprivation)
levels. While no sex differences were observed in OCC GABA, women
had higher frontal lobe GABA, in both MPFC and DLPFC, relative to
men. However, in men, higher MPFC GABA significantly predicted
greater resistance to sleep deprivation on the PVT (p<.05).

200
Conclusions: Findings suggest frontal lobe GABA, specifically in
MPFC, contributes to the ability to resist sleep deprivation in men.
Assessment of neurochemistry may therefore be useful in predicting and
discriminating vulnerable individuals from those who are more resilient
to sleep deprivation. Further exploration of sex differences is warranted.

J.F. BEATTIE, L. VER HOEF, R.C. MARTIN, H. DESHPANDE
& S. LEE. Anterior Hippocampal Dentation Predicts Episodic
Memory Performance in Healthy Adults.
Objective: Previous literature demonstrates the role of the hippocampus
in episodic memory; however, structure-function relationships of the
hippocampus (e.g., volume and memory) have yielded mixed results
(Petten, 2004). Previous analyses examined the relationship between
left and right hippocampal dentation, a novel structural feature on the
inferior surface, and episodic memory. Previous research suggests that
beyond hemispheric specialization, the hippocampus may be regionally-specialized, such that the anterior (body) and posterior (tail) regions
of the hippocampus support different types of memory (Kim, 2015).
The current study examines this hypothesis.
Participants and Methods: Twenty-two healthy adults received episodic memory testing (CVLT-II; Rey Complex Figure Test), and an
ultra high-resolution 3T structural MRI. Hippocampal dentation was
rated independently by two neuroimaging experts. Inter- and intra-rater
reliability were excellent for this novel rating system (ICC > 0.90).
Results: Analyses revealed a positive association between anterior hippocampal dentation and CVLT-II Acquisition score (p = .05), CVLT-II
Long-Delay Free Recall score (p = .02), and Rey Recognition score (p =
.007). No significant difference was found between anterior dentation
and Rey Delay score (p = .38). No significant differences were found
between any of the main memory outcome measures and posterior hippocampal dentation (p = 0.16 to 0.97). When comparing correlation
coefficients between anterior and posterior for each memory measure,
no significant differences were found (i.e., anterior and posterior correlation coefficients not significantly different) in this small sample.
Conclusions: Anterior hippocampal dentation was positively associated
with episodic memory performance in a healthy adult sample indicating possible regional specialization of hippocampal dentation, a novel
morphological feature. Future studies will investigate this relationship
in neurological populations, particularly those affecting memory and
the hippocampus.

W.D. KILLGORE, S.L. RAUCH & I.M. ROSSO. Expressive
Suppression is Associated with Greater Lateral Orbitofrontal
Cortex Volume in Adults with Major Depressive Disorder.
Objective: Impaired emotion regulation (ER) is a central feature of major depressive disorder (MDD). Two common ER strategies are cognitive
reappraisal (modifying thoughts about an emotion-eliciting event) and
expressive suppression (inhibiting behavioral expression of emotion).
In functional neuroimaging studies, activation of the lateral and medial
orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) is associated with use of reappraisal and
suppression, respectively. It is less clear whether anatomical variation in
OFC subregions relates to ER strategies. This study examined whether
self-reported use of reappraisal and suppression were associated with
lateral OFC (lOFC) and medial OFC (mOFC) volume in adults with
MDD and healthy controls (HC).
Participants and Methods: Our analysis included 52 right-handed
adults with MDD (age M = 29.02, SD = 7.62, 20 male), and 42 HC
participants (age M = 28.24, SD = 7.24, 19 male). Subjects were interviewed using the SCID for DSM-IV, completed the Emotion Regulation

Questionnaire (ERQ), and underwent 3T MRI. Multivariate analysis of
variance examined reappraisal and suppression subscores of the ERQ
relative to lOFC and mOFC volumes in both groups, controlling for
intracranial volume, age and sex.
Results: Reappraisal was not significantly associated with OFC volumes in MDD or HC subjects. In MDD subjects, the multivariate effect
of suppression was significant (Wilk’s Λ = .861, p < .05), reflecting a
significant association of suppression with lOFC volume (F(1,48) =
7.05, p < .05) but not mOFC volume (F(1,48) = 3.32, p = .08). In HC,
suppression was not significantly associated with OFC volumes.
Conclusions: Greater use of expressive suppression to regulate emotion
was associated with significantly larger lOFC volume in adults with
MDD, suggesting that structural alterations in the lOFC may contribute
to dispositional differences in ER. Further research is needed to characterize anatomical variations in OFC neural circuitry in dysfunctional ER
in MDD, and assess whether these variations normalize with treatment.

R. CABEEN, T. CONTURO & R. PAUL. Elevated Depression Scores
Predict Long-term Decline in White Matter Integrity Among Older
Adults.
Objective: Previous studies have demonstrated a relationship between
depression and disruptions in white matter (WM) integrity. Quantitative tractography of WM fiber bundle lengths (FBLs) using diffusion
tensor imaging is a measure of WM integrity that may be more sensitive to changes related to the expression of non-clinical symptoms of
depression. To date, no studies have examined the association between
symptoms of depression and longitudinal changes in WM integrity as
measured by FBL. The present study examined the influence of subclinical depressive symptoms at baseline on whole brain and tract specific
FBL change across a 36-month period, independent of age.
Participants and Methods: Nineteen healthy older adults without
current axis I or II psychiatric diagnoses underwent neuroimaging and
emotional assessment. Symptoms of depression were assessed with the
Depression Anxiety Stress Scales. WM fiber models were created using
deterministic streamline tractography, and FBLs were computed for
both the whole brain and bundles selected using atlas-derived labels.
Results: Results revealed a significant relationship between higher reported depressive symptoms at baseline and reduction in mean whole
brain FBLs over 36-months (r= –.709, p=.007). Tract-based analyses
revealed significant correlations between higher baseline depression
scores and more severe reduction in FBLs in the superior thalamic radiation, anterior thalamic radiation, fornix, cerebrospinal tract, uncinate
fasciculus, and hippocampal segment of the cingulum bundle.
Conclusions: . These findings suggest an important relationship between subclinical symptoms of depression and increased vulnerability
for reduced WM integrity over time. Further studies are needed to elucidate the mediating factor between disruptions in these networks and
depression in older adults.

M. CHEN, M. IZZETOGLU, H. BLUMEN & R. HOLTZER. Spatial
Co-registration of Functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy to
Magnetic Resonance Imaging in Older Adults.
Objective: Traditional neuroimaging techniques, such as functional
magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and positron emission tomography
(PET), are limited by requiring participants to remain motionless in a
supine position while scanning. Such limitation makes it more difficult
to study the functional neural substrates of critical abilities such as
gait that are sensitive to aging and age-related diseases. Functional
Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS) is an emerging optical neuroimaging modality that allows movements during data acquisition. Like fMRI,

Forty Fourth Annual INS Meeting Abstracts
fNIRS measures the hemodynamic response, or changes in blood flow
in brain tissues. However, fNIRS provides limited spatial information.
A standard method to co-register fNIRS channels to structural images
such as MRI is currently unavailable. fNIRS-MRI co-registration studies
are scarce and, to our knowledge, have not been done in the elderly.
Participants and Methods: In the current study, fNIRS and structural
MRI were acquired from 30 non-demented older adults. We applied
existing techniques to co-register 16 fNIRS channels designed to assess
hemodynamic changes in the prefrontal cortex to structural MRI. Vitamin E capsules were used to mark the locations of fNIRS detectors
and light sources on the scalp. These markers became visible on the
structural MRI scans for further analysis. We used the balloon-inflation
algorithm to project fNIRS channel locations on the scalp to underlying
cortical surface. Those individual cortical projection points were then
normalized and averaged.
Results: Sixteen mean cortical projection points were found and presented in both MNI (Montreal Neurological Institute) and Talairach
coordinate systems. These points resided in the prefrontal cortex and
were visually depicted on a 3D brain model.
Conclusions: Our methods and results provide a detailed pipeline for
fNIRS-MRI co-registration in older adults as well as useful spatial information for standalone fNIRS quantitative data in future studies.

Increased Somatic Complaints in Pediatric TBI.
Objective: Individuals who have sustained a traumatic brain injury
(TBI), including children, often complain of physical symptoms. The
current study examined children who were part of the Social Outcomes
of Brain Injury in Kids (SOBIK) investigation wherein parents rated
the degree of somatic symptoms in their children with TBI based on
the Behavior Assessment System for Children (BASC-2). This study
explores initial findings utilizing MRI voxel-based morphometry (VBM)
technique to examine neuropathological correlates of parental reports
of psychosocial adjustment, specifically somatic symptom endorsement
in in children.
Participants and Methods: Seventy-two children with TBI and 50 OI
children (8-13 years of age) underwent magnetic resonance imaging
(MRI) at 1.5 Tesla. Injury severity based on the Glasgow Coma Scale
(GCS) was used to further subdivide TBI into mild, moderate, and
severe injury groups. Advanced Normalization Tools (ANTs) were used
to warp T1-weighted images and statistical analyses were performed
using the Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM8) toolbox in Matlab. A
full factorial analysis was used to evaluate BASC-2 scores in conjunction
with neuroanatomy in OI, mild, moderate, and severe TBI groups. A
cluster threshold of 150 voxels was used to control for multiple tests of
comparison and identify regions of interests.
Results: Whole-brain VBM revealed that higher somatization scores
were associated with smaller volumes in the right temporal lobe. These
findings only remained significant in the severe injury group (T = 5.25;
MNI peak, 34, -47, -8; cluster size, 1,539 mm3; PFWE < 0.05). Somatization scores did not significantly correlate to any other injury group.
Conclusions: Reports of somatic symptoms in pediatric TBI were associated with alterations in the right anterior temporal lobe. Specifically,
decreased brain volumes in the ventral and polar regions were associated
with higher reports of somatization.

Aggression in Pediatric Traumatic Brain Injury.
Objective: The Social Outcome of Brain Injury in Kids (SOBIK) is
a multi-center pediatric TBI outcome study involving children, all of
whom completed MRI, neuropsychological and social outcome measures, and were compared to those with just orthopedic injuries (OI). Social outcome was based on multiple measures, including parent ratings
from the Behavior Assessment System for Children (BASC-2). The aim
of this investigation was to explore initial findings between voxel-based
morphometry (VBM) image analysis and social outcomes in pediatric
TBI, specifically parental reports of aggression.
Participants and Methods: Seventy-two children with TBI and 50 OI
children (8-13 years of age) underwent magnetic resonance imaging
(MRI) at 1.5 Tesla. Injury severity based on the Glasgow Coma Scale
(GCS) was used to further subdivide TBI into mild, moderate, and

with neuroanatomy in OI, mild, moderate, and severe TBI groups. A
cluster threshold of 150 voxels was used to control for multiple tests of
comparison and identify regions of interests.
Results: Significant structural alterations that survived correction for
family-wise error (FEW) were associated with BASC-2 Aggression
scores in the left (T = 6.34; MNI peak, -14, -5, -11; cluster size, 2,094

group (T = 6.29; MNI peak, 13, -5, -12; cluster size, 3,155 mm3; PFWE
< 0.05). Due to sample size limits in the moderate and severe groups no
findings in those groups survived FEW correction.
Conclusions: Increased bilateral atrophy of the medial temporal lobe
was found to be associated with increased parental reporting of aggressive behaviors based on BASC-2 ratings.

Brain Voxel Based Morphometry in Idiopathic PD: The Influence
of Total Intracranial Volume.
Objective: Voxel-based morphometry (VBM) is a popular method for
comparing structural brain differences in MRI analyses. For Parkinson’s
disease (PD), VMB has yielded mixed results. One cause for this discrepancy could be larger total intracranial volume (TICV) in PD, which has
been reported, but not accounted for in all VBM studies. We explored
TICV’s influence in VBM through two experiments:
Experiment 1: compared PD patients and controls before and after
controlling for TICV.
Experiment 2: compared controls split into large and small TICV before
and after controlling for TICV.
Participants and Methods: Experiment 1 consisted of 40 PD participants and 40 controls. Experiment 2 consisted of 88 controls median
split by TICV. All participants completed an MRI on a 3T scanner.
TICV was calculated as gray+white+CSF from Freesurfer. VBM was
performed on T1 images using an optimized VBM protocol (Good et
al., 2001). Volume differences were assessed using a voxel-wise GLM
analysis. An area was considered significant if cluster size >10 and p<.05
corrected for familywise error.
Results: Experiment 1: PD had larger TICV than controls (1746±170cc
and 1647±126cc, p=.004). Before controlling for TICV, the PD group
showed reduced GM volumes primarily in bilateral temporal lobes,
bilateral occipital lobes, bilateral calcarine sulcus, left parahippocampus, and bilateral cerebellum. After controlling for TICV, the PD group
showed reduced volume in a smaller cluster in the left temporal lobe.
Experiment 2: The large TICV group showed reduced volume in parts
of bilateral hippocampi, bilateral temporal lobes, left parietal lobe and

202
bilateral cerebellum. None of these differences survived after controlling
for TICV.
Conclusions: Experiment 1 showed widespread volumetric decreases
in PD that mostly disappeared after controlling for TICV. Experiment
2 demonstrated that TICV influences VBM results independently from
other factors. Controlling for TICV in VBM studies is recommended.

S.J. CROWLEY, D. RAMON, S. AMINI, N. SCHWAB, L. HIZEL,
J.J. TANNER & C. PRICE. Testing the Reliability and Validity of
Three Total Intracranial Volume Measurement Methods.
Objective: Total intracranial volume (TICV) is an important control
variable, but its calculation is challenging. Manual TICV is the gold
standard but is labor intensive, and automatic methods vary in reliability. To find a rapid and valid TICV approach, we assessed two Freesurfer TICV metrics (eTIV and Brainmask) relative to manual TICV. We
evaluated validity by examining how the TICV metrics alter entorhinal
cortex (ERC) volume/memory correlations. We hypothesized that eTIV
would be inferior to the other metrics.
Participants and Methods: 40 Parkinson’s disease (PD) and 40 controls completed an MRI and WMS-III Logical Memory Subtest (LM).
TICV metrics were:
Manual TICV: raters traced the inner surface of the skull on every T1
slice
Freesurfer Brainmask: volume of gray, white, and CSF voxels
Freesurfer eTIV: calculated using the transformation matrix from T1
into Talairach space
Reliability: Two-way interclass correlations and dice similarity index
for volume comparisons
Validity: Correlations between left ERC volume and LM retention
(LMret) and discrimination (LMdis) were examined with and without
correction for each TICV method
Results: Reliability: Brainmask volumes were larger than manual
volumes (1696cc±158cc, 1665±166cc, p<.001) and eTIV smaller
(1564±256cc; p<.001). Both correlated with manual TICV (Brainmask
r=.94, ICC=.92, p<.001; eTIV r=0.82, ICC=0.68, p<0.001).
Validity: Before controlling for TICV, ERC correlated with LMret
(β=.254, p=.023) and LMdis (β=.232, p=.038). Brainmask and manual
retained correlations for LMret (β=.322 and β=.308; respectively) and
LMdis (β=.250 and β=.244 respectively). Associations were significant
but weaker with eTIV (LMret: β=.277 and LMdis: β=.231).
Conclusions: Both Freesurfer metrics showed acceptable reliability and
validity, yet the strength of expected ERC-memory associations were
lower when controlling with eTIV. Given these findings, we recommend
Brainmask over eTIV for brain-behavioral based research. Partially

A. FRIDMAN, D. PISNER, P. SINGH & W.D. KILLGORE. Gray
Matter Volume in Left Medial Prefrontal Cortex Is Related to Life
Satisfaction in Individuals with Mild Traumatic Brain Injury.
Objective: The prefrontal cortex (PFC) is involved in linking emotion
and motivation with situational appraisal to influence goal directed
behavior. Considerable evidence supports the functional asymmetry of
the PFC for emotional processes, where the left hemisphere is biased
toward positive and approach emotions, and the right hemisphere is
biased toward negative and withdrawal emotions. We hypothesized that
gray matter (GM) volume in the PFC of individuals who have incurred
mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) would correlate with life satisfaction
in accordance with prior models of affective asymmetry.

Participants and Methods: Twenty-six right-handed mTBI participants (11 males, mean age = 23.4) underwent high resolution T1
structural neuroimaging and completed the Satisfaction with Life
Scale (SWLS). After covarying for age, gender, time since injury and
intra-cranial volume, a voxel-based morphometric (VBM) multiple regression analysis was conducted within Statistical Parametric Mapping
(SPM8) to explore the association between gray matter volume in the
PFC and SWLS scores.
Results: Utilizing a small volume correction for the frontal lobe region-of-interest (ROI), greater GM volume in the left hemisphere of
the superior frontal gyrus was positively correlated with SWLS scores
(7 voxels, p<0.05, FWE corrected). No association was found in the
right PFC.
Conclusions: Consistent with the theory of lateralized affective processing, we find that greater volume of the left medial prefrontal cortex
was associated with greater satisfaction with life among individuals
with recent brain injuries. Future work should compare these findings
to that of healthy controls and whether larger left PFC volume might
be predictive of subsequent recovery. Considering the detrimental effects on mood that individuals often experience following mTBI, brain
imaging techniques like VBM can be used to aid risk assessment for
subsequent mood changes.

Bigler et al. MRI Tissue-based intensity standardization for multisite neuropsychological outcome studies: Problems and Potential
Solutions.
Objective: In this era of the human connectome, automated image
analysis techniques, and large scale multi-site neuroimaging databases
examining neuropsychological outcome, there is a particular need to address how to combine neuroimaging studies that use different volumetric
sequences or MRI studies performed on different platforms.
Participants and Methods: Two different approaches were examined.
Individual subjects were scanned on up to 4 different platforms at different intervals or the same individual scanned on the same scanner. The
FreeSurfer (FS) outputs were compared between the standardized and
nonstandardized human phantom images. Then, statistical analyses and
standardization were performed on a large database of T1 images from
a multi-site TBI project that involved three different MR scanners with
two different platforms. Both the nonstandardized and standardized
groups were analyzed and then compared.
Results: After standardization, the FS data remained variable for the
human phantom outputs. However, statistical analyses show subtle
differences between standardized and nonstandardized images from
the multi-site dataset morphological maps yielding different behavioral
findings. In some instances, the standardized images show an increase
in cluster strength in the TBI group after family wise error correction.
Similarly, presumably false positive findings from control comparisons
were removed by standardization.
Conclusions: The human phantom data suggests that standardization
does little to correct the underlying problems with multi-site imaging.
This suggests that differences exist that are related to the multisite nature of the data acquisition. Recommendations on the best way for neuropsychological outcome studies to deal with these issues will be offered.

Forty Fourth Annual INS Meeting Abstracts
underlying brain changes, suggesting that possible differences in etiological mechanisms may explain the heterogeneity of symptoms in
depression. Little work on symptom dimensions of depression focuses on
white matter lesions (WMLs). The current study was conducted to fill a
gap in literature examining symptom dimensions and regional WMLs.
Participants and Methods: Participants included 42 healthy volunteers (mean age=71.38) from the Active Brain study, an ongoing study
at the University of Florida. Participants completed the Beck Depression
Inventory, Second Edition and received a 3-Tesla magnetic resonance
imaging scan, including T1 3D anatomical and T2-weighted fluid attenuated inversion recovery scans. WML volumes were quantified using
Freesurfer, AFNI, and FMRIB Software Library. Regions of interest
including frontal, temporal, parietal, and occipital lobes, and limbic and
subcortical areas were defined using the Wake Forest Atlas from SPM 8.
Results: We found that higher total depressive symptoms predicted increased temporal and frontal WMLs, particularly at older ages. We also
found a depressive symptom by sex effect such that male sex and higher
symptoms predicted increased temporal and limbic WMLs. Higher somatic symptoms predicted increased temporal and frontal WMLs, and
this effect was greater at older ages. Elevated affective symptoms predicted increased temporal and limbic WMLs in men, but not women.
Cognitive symptoms did not predict regional WMLs.
Conclusions: These findings are consistent with the literature showing that somatic and affective symptom dimensions are most strongly
associated with depression-related brain changes. Findings suggest an
important role of addressing the mechanisms associated with WML
development in treating depression in older adults.

A. MORALES, T. WILLIAMSON & A.D. THAMES. The Interactive
Effects of HIV and Marijuana Use on Cognition and White Matter
Integrity.
Objective: Research on healthy individuals has demonstrated adverse
effects of recent marijuana (MJ) use on cognition and brain structure
connectivity. However, few studies have investigated this relationship
in HIV+ populations, who often report use of MJ for symptom management. The current study examined the independent and interactive effects of HIV and MJ use on white matter (WM) integrity and
neurocognition.
Participants and Methods: HIV+(n=19) and HIV-(n=17) individuals
who reported current MJ use (n=18) or no use (n=18) underwent Diffusion Tensor Imaging and neuropsychological assessment. For MJ users,
we examined frequency, usage amount and time since last use using the
Marijuana Smoking History and the Drug Use History questionnaires.
We extracted fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD)
values from regions of interest.
Results: After controlling for age, nicotine and alcohol use HIV+ individuals demonstrated greater MD than controls in the cingulate gyrus,
corticospinal tract and anterior thalamic radiation (p<.05). MJ users had
greater MD in the uncinate fasciculus than non-users, (p=.05). Control
MJ users showed greater MD of the hippocampus, F(5,30)=5.43, p=.03,
and FA of the temporal superior longitudinal fasciculus, F(5,30)=4.289,
p=.04, than control non-users. There were no significant differences
between HIV+ MJ users and HIV+ non-users. There was a significant
effect of MJ on learning and memory (p<.05), with users performing
worse than non-users. For MJ users, we found significant associations
between amount of MJ consumed and memory functioning (r=-.34) and
MD of the cingulate gyrus (r=-.57).
Conclusions: Consistent with previous studies, the adverse effects of
MJ use on neurological integrity were found in healthy controls. Brain
regions that were compromised as a function of MJ use are consistent
with the learning and memory deficits. Failure to detect MJ-associated
abnormalities among HIV+ individuals may be due to existing neurological compromise, rendering the effects of MJ undetectable.

Relationship Between Resilience and Hippocampus Volume in
Adults With and Without Posttraumatic Stress Disorder.
Objective: Trait resilience, the ability to rebound from adversity, may
relate to individual differences in neurobiological systems that modulate
the stress response. The hippocampus is of particular interest as a neural
correlate of resilience, given animal research showing that adaptive
coping stimulates hippocampal growth. In humans, the link between
trait resilience and hippocampal volume has received less study. It is also
unclear to what extent relationships between hippocampal morphometry
and resilience are preserved in individuals with stress-related psychopathology. This study examined whether trait resilience was associated
with hippocampal volume in adults with posttraumatic stress disorder
(PTSD) and healthy controls (HC).
Participants and Methods: Thirty-three adults with DSM-IV PTSD
and 30 matched HCs completed the Connor Davidson Resilience Scale
(CDRISC) and a structural MRI at 3T. Linear regressions were conducted separately for PTSD and HC groups, entering CDRISC scores
as predictors of hippocampal volume, while controlling for intracranial
volume, age and sex.
Results: PTSD and HC participants differed significantly in CDRISC
scores (p <. 01), but not hippocampal volumes. CDRISC total score was
significantly associated with total hippocampal volume in HCs [β = .42,
p = .02], but not in PTSD participants. CDRISC score was significantly
associated with both left [β = .41, p = .02] and right [β = .41, p =
.02] hippocampal volumes in HCs. In a follow up analysis examining
CDRISC subscales, acceptance was the only significant predictor for
total [p = .03], left [p = .03], and right [p = .03] hippocampal volume
in HCs.
Conclusions: Trait resilience may be at least partly mediated by larger
hippocampus volume in healthy adults and this relationship may be explained by the ability to accept and bounce back from change. Reduced
trait resilience in PTSD may not be related to hippocampus structure,
and may have partially distinct neural correlates than in healthy adults
without stress-related disorders.

S.D. ANTON & V.M. DOTSON. Symptom Dimensions of Depression
and Age Impact Subfield Hippocampal Volume.
Objective: Depressive symptoms have been associated with volumetric
differences in the hippocampus, particularly in the CA1, CA2-3, and
subiculum subfields. We recently found an interaction between depressive symptoms and age such that higher depressive symptoms were
associated with less age-related volumetric decline in the right subiculum and right CA1 regions. However, it is unclear whether any specific
symptom dimensions of depression are responsible for this interaction
between age and depressive symptoms. This study was conducted as a
follow-up to address this question.
Participants and Methods: Forty-two community-dwelling older
adults completed the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale
(CES-D) and underwent magnetic resonance imaging at 3T. Depressed
mood, lack of well-being, and somatic subscale scores were calculated
for each participant. Left and right volumes of CA1, CA2-3 and subiculum subfields were obtained via an automated FreeSurfer procedure.
Multiple hierarchical regressions were conducted to assess the effects
of age, CES-D subscale scores, and their interaction on hippocampal
subfield volumes, with sex and estimated total intracranial volume as
covariates.

204
Results: A significant interaction between somatic symptoms and age
was found in the bilateral subiculum (right p= 0.002, left p= 0.012) and
right CA1 (p = 0.003), such that higher levels of somatic symptoms were
associated with less age-related volume loss. A depressed mood by age
interaction in the right subiculum (p= 0.042) showed a similar pattern.
Conclusions: Results suggest somatic symptoms of depression, and to
a lesser extent depressed mood, may drive the interrelationship between
age, depressive symptoms and hippocampal subfield volume. Findings
highlight the importance of examining unique correlates of the heterogeneous symptoms that comprise depressive disorders. More research
is needed to better understand the neurobiological underpinnings of
depressive symptoms, and how this interacts with age-related brain
changes.

Integrity Predicts Performance on Instrumental Activities of Daily
Living (IADLs) in Older Adults.
Objective: Previous research shows a positive relationship between
brain structure and performance of activities of daily living (ADLs) in
older adults. In particular, microstructural white matter (WM) changes
are associated with decline in ADLs. We sought to replicate and extend
findings on the relation of WM integrity and ADL performance.
Participants and Methods: 92 community-dwelling older adults (46
female) aged 64 to 86 years (M =73, SD = 6.13) were recruited across
two samples. Participants underwent diffusion tensor MRI. WM integrity
was defined by fractional anisotropy (FA) and radial diffusivity (RD).
Instrumental ADLs were assessed via the performance-based Direct
Assessment of Functional Status – Revised (DAFS-R). Hierarchical regression analysis was conducted to predict DAFS-R from global FA and
RD plus FA and RD in 4 regions of interest (uncinate fasciculus, fornix,
genu of the corpus callosum, and hippocampal cingulum). Age, gender,
education, and cognitive impairment were controlled.
Results: Global FA (R2 change = .05, p = .003) and FA in the fornix
(R2 change = .028, p = .028), genu (R2 change = .078, p < .001) and
hippocampal cingulum (R2 change = .09, p < .001) positively predicted DAFS-R. RD in the hippocampal cingulum (R2 change = .052,
p = .004) also positively predicted DAFS-R. Additional exploratory
analyses showed a positive relationship between DAFS-R and FA in
the cingulate, body and splenium of the corpus callosum, internal and
external capsules, superior longitudinal fasciculus, and superior fronto-occipital fasciculus.
Conclusions: This study is one of the few to predict ADLs from WM integrity. To our knowledge it is the only study to use a performance-based
IADL task. Results replicate previous findings and show diffuse WM
involvement in older adults’ IADL performance. Integrity of the hippocampal cingulum most strongly predicted IADLs. FA was more sensitive
than RD to IADLs.

& S. BOWDEN. Automated versus Manual Measurement of
Hippocampus and Entorhinal Cortex in a Memory Clinic Sample.
Objective: Structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is commonly
used in assessing the integrity of the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex
in suspected Alzheimer’s Disease (AD). Compared to manual volumetry, automated segmentation protocols offered by FreeSurfer afford
greater efficiency for quantitative measurement. Independent validation
and clinical utility studies however, remain scarce for newer FreeSurfer

segmentation protocols, particularly when using routinely acquired diagnostic scans.
Participants and Methods: Manual and automated measurements
of hippocampal and entorhinal volumes were performed on 30 routine diagnostic 1.5 T MRI scans of memory clinic patients referred for
dementia evaluation. Automated measurements were generated with
two hippocampal protocols and two entorhinal protocols in FreeSurfer
(version 5.3.0). Comparison of automated measurements relative to
manual volumetry for each region of interest was assessed for reliability
with intra-class correlation coefficients and method agreement using
Bland-Altman plots.
Results: High reliabilities and agreement were demonstrated by both
FreeSurfer automated hippocampal protocols. The original hippocampal protocol (based on the Desikan atlas) overestimated whole hippocampal volumes by 9.6% while the new hippocampal subfields package
underestimated volumes by 8.4% (excluding presubiculum and choroid
plexus subregions). Compared to the hippocampal protocols, the entorhinal protocols showed poorer reliabilities and agreement; the recent
ex-vivo validated entorhinal protocol over-estimated entorhinal volumes
by 14% while the original entorhinal protocol (also based on the Desikan
atlas) over-estimated entorhinal volumes by 103%.
Conclusions: These preliminary results support the likelihood that
automated volumetry of the mesial temporal region using more recent
FreeSurfer software versions can be performed on routinely acquired
diagnostic MRI scans to assist in the evaluation of patients with suspected AD.

Delay Discounting in Emerging Adult Binge Drinkers.
Objective: Impulsivity and abnormalities of the brain’s reward system
have been associated with varying levels of alcohol misuse. The current study examined delay discounting, a marker of impulsive decision
making, in relation to the volume of the nucleus accumbens (NAcc), a
key region in brain reward circuitry, and aimed to identify differences
between binge drinkers and light drinkers.
Participants and Methods: Magnetic resonance imaging datasets were
acquired at 3T in 18-24 year old binge alcohol drinkers (BD, n=18; 9
male) and light alcohol drinkers (LD, n=19; 9 male). Cortical reconstruction and volumetric segmentation were performed using Freesurfer.
Participants completed a battery of neuropsychological measures that
included the Monetary Choice Questionnaire (MCQ), which assesses
reward valuation and delay discounting.
Results: BD were significantly more likely than LD to discount delays
(prefer smaller but more immediate rewards) on large-reward trials. In
addition, smaller right NAcc volume was strongly predictive of a higher
impulsive choice ratio for small, medium, and large rewards in the BD
group, but not in the LD group.
Conclusions: Although BD and LD showed no significant differences in
NAcc volumes in either hemisphere, right NAcc volume was significantly
predictive of MCQ responses in BD. The finding that this relationship is
specific to the BD group suggests that the behavioral outcomes of binge
drinkers depend more heavily on reward system morphology than the
outcomes of their LD counterparts (possibly due to impaired functioning
of other brain regions involved in regulatory control). Characterization
of reward system morphology and behavioral outcomes associated with
binge alcohol consumption may help identify unique risk factors for the
later manifestation of alcohol abuse and dependence in young individuals who are heavy frequent drinkers.

C. DECARLI, P.A. WOLF & R. AU. Association between Atrial
Fibrillation and Volumetric MRI Brain Measures: Framingham
Offspring Study.
Objective: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is associated with a significant degree
of morbidity and mortality. The increased risk of stroke and cognitive
impairment associated with AF has been well studied. Although it is
known that AF is detrimental to brain function, there is a paucity of
research investigating the relationship between AF and brain morphology. We aim to investigate the association between AF and brain volume
measures on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the Framingham
Heart Study (FHS) Offspring cohort.
Participants and Methods: The study sample included 2144 stroke/
dementia-free participants (mean age=61.8±9.3 years; 54% women)
who attended the 7th examination cycle (1999-2005) of the FHS Offspring cohort and underwent contemporaneous MRI. Linear regression
was used to examine the association between prevalent AF and brain
volume measures (total cerebral brain volume, frontal brain volume,
temporal brain volume, temporal horn volume, hippocampal volume,
and white matter hyperintensity volume). Models were adjusted first for
age and sex and then for vascular risk factors and APOE4.
Results: A total of 73 (3.4%) participants had prevalent AF at the time
of the MRI. In age/sex-adjusted models, AF was inversely associated with
total cerebral brain volume (Beta±standard error [SE])= -1.18±0.33,
p<0.001), frontal brain volume (Beta±SE= -1.12±0.35, p=0.001), and
temporal brain volume (Beta±SE= -0.31±0.10, p=0.002). After further
adjustment for vascular risk factors and APOE4, AF remained associated with only frontal brain volume (Beta±SE= -0.82±0.38, p=0.03).
Conclusions: Prevalent AF was associated with smaller frontal brain
volume after accounting for vascular risk factor burden. Further exploration of the association between AF and brain morphology is warranted.

Tensor Imaging Following Pediatric Brain Tumor: Associations
with Neuropsychological and Psychosocial Functioning.
Objective: Children are at risk for neurocognitive and psychosocial
difficulties following pediatric brain tumor (PBT). These deficits may
be due to disruptions in the anatomical integrity of brain systems that
support neurocognitive function and/or emotion regulation, as a result
of the tumor itself or its required treatment.
Participants and Methods: We assessed brain structure, specifically
white matter integrity, and neurocognitive and psychosocial functioning of 8-16 year-old survivors of PBT (n=16; 7 girls; mean time since
treatment=4.94 years) and 8-16 year-old healthy children (n=16; 10
girls). Children underwent diffusion tensor imaging, and completed neuropsychological assessment (WISC-IV, D-KEFS). Parent and self-report
of children’s executive (BRIEF) and psychosocial functioning (CBC,
YSR) were obtained.
Results: Relative to healthy children, survivors of PBT had significantly
lower overall fractional anisotropy (FA), indicating reduced white matter integrity (t=-2.56, p=.016). Survivors performed more poorly on
most objective measures of neurocognitive function, and were rated by
parents as having reduced social and total competency, withdrawal,
social problems, and symptoms of internalizing, externalizing, and total
problems. By self-report, survivors reported lower total competency.
Lower FA was associated with poorer performance on most speed-based
neurocognitive measures, poorer parent-reported executive function
(BRIEF), and reduced overall competency and greater symptoms of
anxiety/depression, and total problems (CBC).
Conclusions: Although neurocognitive and psychosocial deficits have
been consistently documented following PBT, their neuroanatomical
correlates have received less attention. Better understanding of how
brain integrity contributes to deficits may improve early identification
of children at elevated risk. White matter tractography and linkage with

205
the brain’s functional activation are important next steps to understand
the variability in outcome following PBT.

L.M. CAGLE & R. PAUL. Tract-Specific Changes in White Matter
Fiber Bundle Lengths with Age.
Objective: Cross-sectional studies utilizing quantitative tractography
based on diffusion tensor imaging (qtDTI) have shown that white matter
fiber bundle lengths (FBLs) are shorter among older adults compared
to younger adults. At present no study has examined the longitudinal
impact of age on FBLs among healthy older adults, or the extent to
which changes in FBL are associated with changes in more common
DTI metrics.
Participants and Methods: The present study examined age-related
changes in FBL in specific fiber tracts and whole-brain white matter
among 48 older adults across a 36-month period. To account for anatomical differences in fiber organization, FBL was measured separately
as both the average length and total length of fibers within a given tract.
DTI scalar metrics were used as comparison methods for evaluating
white matter changes with age.
Results: Results revealed a significant decrease in average FBL in the
cingulate gyrus segment of the left cingulum (CGC), and a significant
decrease in total FBL in the right anterior thalamic radiation (ATR) over
time. The right ATR also demonstrated increased mean diffusivity and
decreased fractional anisotropy across time points. Whole-brain analyses revealed a significant longitudinal reduction in total FBL, but no
significant changes were observed in average FBL or DTI scalar metrics.
Conclusions: Results suggest that FBL is sensitive to aging effects in
older adults and that total FBL may be preferentially sensitive to microstructural changes in whole-brain white matter compared to other DTI
metrics. Changes observed for average FBL versus total FBL in the CGC
and ATR are likely due to anatomical differences in fiber organization
(e.g., packing density, length coherence), suggesting that both FBL
indices provide unique information based on fiber tract organization.
Further studies are needed to evaluate the functional significance of
these findings.

Relations of Socioeconomic Status to Prefrontal Cortex Volumes
among African American and White Adults.
Objective: Disparities associated with lower socioeconomic status
(SES) and African American (AA) race have been noted for subclinical
brain pathology. Education is an SES indicator that has been related
to smaller volumes in select regions of the prefrontal cortex (PFC). AAs
may be more vulnerable to this association, in part, due to an aggregation of environmental and interpersonal stressors. Accordingly, here we
examined potential interactive relations of education and self-identified
race to regional PFC gray matter (GM) volumes.
Participants and Methods: Participants were 153 neurologically intact, community-dwelling AAs and Whites (mean age = 47 years; 41%
male, 64% White, mean education = 12.8 years) from the Healthy
Aging in Neighborhoods of Diversity across the Life Span (HANDLS)
SCAN study. Participants underwent 3.0-T cranial magnetic resonance
imaging. Volumetric T1-weighted MP-RAGE images were used to derive
regions of interest (ROIs) using a multi-atlas label fusion method. Examined here were medial, lateral, inferior, and opercular regions of the

206
PFC. Multiple regression analyses examined interactions of education
and race and their first-order associations, adjusting for sex and age,
with each right (R) and left (L) ROI.
Results: Significant education×race interactions were noted for R
frontal medial (r2=0.03; p<0.05), L frontal medial (r2=0.04; p<0.05),
R frontal lateral (r2=0.07; p<0.01) and L frontal lateral (r2=0.07;
p<0.01) regions, such that Whites with higher levels of education had
greater volumes than all other groups.
Conclusions: Whereas Whites with higher educational attainment had
greater lateral and medial PFC GM volumes, AAs did not. Findings may
have prognostic significance for the disproportionate rates of dementia
and cognitive decline seen in AAs and lower SES groups, and may
be partially explained by the unique stressors encountered by these
individuals.

W.D. KILLGORE. Volumetric Differences in Gray Matter in Healthy
Versus Overweight/Obese Individuals Post Mild Traumatic Brain
Injury: A Voxel Based Morphometric Study.
Objective: Mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) typically involves diffuse injury to axonal pathways, but may also affect core gray matter
structures. Due to its location deep within the brain, the striatum is
often vulnerable to damage during mTBI. Striatal damage could have
important implications for behavior, as this region plays a critical role in
cognition, reward processing, and motivation, including food consumption. In the present study, we compared the whole brain gray matter
volume of healthy normal weight individuals versus overweight/obese
individuals with recent history of mTBI.
Participants and Methods: Participants included twenty four right
handed mTBI individuals,12 healthy (BMI ≤ 25) and 12 overweight
(BMI > 25). Voxel-based morphometry (VBM8) was used to analyze
T1 high resolution magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) structural scans.
Segmented gray matter images were analyzed to determine regions in
which healthy and overweight groups were different
Results: After controlling for age, gender, intra-cranial volume,
and time since injury, gray matter volume was significantly greater
(p<0.005) in the healthy group compared to the overweight group in a
number of brain regions, including the bilateral caudate nucleus (head)
regions, nucleus accumbens, bilateral parahippocampal gyrus, left inferior temporal gyrus, and left medial frontal gyrus
Conclusions: Significant differences in gray matter volumes were found
between healthy and overweight individuals, particularly within regions
involved in reward, executive functioning, memory, and emotion. Interestingly, the direction of findings for the ventral striatum is opposite
of that often reported for non-brain injured individuals, raising the
possibility that mTBI might alter these associations. Future research
will need to examine the role of mTBI in weight gain and motivational
deficits relative to non-injured individuals.

Corpus Callosum Volume and Reading Skill in Adult Survivors of
Childhood Brain Tumors.
Objective: Adult survivors of childhood posterior fossa tumors can
experience reading difficulties related to white matter integrity. Previously, reading was shown to be related to cortical white matter tracts,
however information transfer across the corpus callosum (CC) may also
play a role in reading. The current study examined how white matter
volume in 5 divisions of the CC was related to degree of neurological
risk and reading skill. Reading was hypothesized to correlate with the

most anterior and posterior CC divisions, which connect frontal and
posterior reading systems, respectively.
Participants and Methods: Twenty survivors and 24 healthy adults
participated. The CC was manually traced on 3 mid-sagittal slices of
a T1-weighted MPRAGE scan. The CC was divided into a 5 division
scheme based on prior tractography research of cortical connections.
CC1 was most anterior (i.e., the genu) and CC5 was most posterior (i.e.,
the splenium). Total intracranial volume was used as a covariate. WJ-III
Letter-Word Identification was utilized to measure reading, the finger
tapping test to measure motor skill, and the Neurological Predictor Scale
to measure neurological risk.
Results: Survivors had significantly lower volume in all CC divisions
except CC3 (CC3 was a trend; p=.06). Volumes of CC2-5 were negatively correlated with level of neurological risk (CC1 was a trend;
p=.07). Shunt placement and treatment with radiation/chemotherapy
were both correlated with volumes in the body of the CC (CC2-4). Word
reading was significantly related to volume of CC divisions 2-5. Volumes
of CC2-4 were also related to motor skill.
Conclusions: Corpus callosum volume was almost globally reduced in
survivors of posterior fossa tumors and volume varied with the level of
neurological risk. Treatment with radiation/chemotherapy and shunt
placement had the most impact on volume. Reading did not show the
expected relationship with CC1; however CC5 was significantly related
to reading but not motor skill and thus appears to be specific to reading.

Cortical Thickness Relates to Impulse Control in Adolescents and
Emerging Adults.
Objective: The brain undergoes dynamic and requisite changes during
adolescence that are associated with improved cognitive efficiency. Developmental reductions in grey matter thickness reflect, in part, pruning of excess neurons and maturation of synapses, which contribute
to improved cognitive and behavioral development. While prefrontal
maturational changes are prevalent, less is known about the role of the
insula, although it has been implicated in emotional regulation, decision
making, prospective thinking, and self-rated impulsivity. The current
study examined impulse control and insula cortical thickness in healthy
adolescents (ADOL) and emerging adults (EA).
Participants and Methods: 31 ADOL and 18 EA underwent high-resolution MRI at 3T, and cortical surface reconstruction and thickness
estimation were performed using Freesurfer. Inhibitory control measures included Barratt Impulsiveness Scale (BIS), Go-NoGo and Stroop
Color-Word Task.
Results: Cortical thickness in superior circular sulcus of the insula was
significantly greater in ADOL relative to EA: thickness on the left predicted better Go NoGo and Stroop performance and thickness on the
right predicted better performance on Go NoGo and lower BIS scores
(less total and motor impulsivity).
Conclusions: Results from this study replicate previous evidence of an
age-related association between cortical thickness in a combined anterior insula region and BIS scores, collectively suggesting that cortical
thickness reductions in insula, likely via normative neuronal pruning,
are associated with better impulse control. The current findings also
suggest that a specific region of ‘anterior insula’, the superior segment of
the circular sulcus, dissociates domains of impulsivity, with hemisphere
laterality uniquely predicting neuropsychological indices of cognitive
control from self-reported motor impulsiveness.

S.M. SZYMKOWICZ, M.E. MCLAREN, L. DE WIT, A. O’SHEA,
A. WOODS, S.D. ANTON & V.M. DOTSON. Structural Abnormalities
in Cortical Thickness, Surface Area, and Volume of the Precuneus
in Older Adults with Depressive Symptoms.
Objective: The precuneus has been implicated in many structural and
functional studies of depression due to its involvement in self-referential
processing and visual imagery. We recently reported that older adults
with higher depressive symptoms had greater cortical thickness in the
left precuneus. However, it is unclear whether abnormalities in surface
area or volume of this region are also evident. The current study addressed these questions.
Participants and Methods: Forty-three community-dwelling adults
(mean age = 68.79 ± 7.00 years) completed the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale and underwent structural magnetic resonance imaging scanning at 3T. Measures of cortical thickness, surface
area, and volume were extracted from the right and left precuneus.
Age-related differences in these measurements, as well as their association with total depressive symptoms, were assessed. Exploratory analyses investigating depressive symptom dimensions (depressed mood,
lack of well-being, somatic) for any significant relationships were also
conducted.
Results: Main effects of age were seen for left precuneus surface area (p
= .015) and volume (p = .011), such that higher age was associated with
less surface area and volume. An age by depressive symptoms interaction
was found for cortical thickness in the left precuneus (p = .037), such
that higher depressive symptoms were associated with less age-related
cortical thinning. Follow-up analyses found a significant age by somatic
symptoms interaction (p < .001), suggesting that somatic symptoms,
rather than depressed mood or lack of well-being, drove this effect.
Conclusions: We found that cortical thickness, rather than surface
area or volume, of the precuneus is associated with elevated depressive
symptoms in older adults, and that this association may be driven by
somatic symptoms. Further research is needed to better understand
possible mechanisms through which subthreshold depressive symptoms
are associated with the precuneus during aging.

J.M. FLETCHER. Increased Gyrification and Thinner Cortex in
Children with Poor Single Word Decoding Skills.
Objective: Prior studies of adults with dyslexia have demonstrated atypical patterns of neural structure and function implicating a left-hemisphere reading network. However, studies of pediatric dyslexia are
sparse, vary widely in reading classification and neuroimaging methods,
and thus yield inconsistent associations between reading ability and
cortical metrics across studies. This study investigated differences in
cortical thickness and local gyrification index between children with
poor versus typical single word reading skills.
Participants and Methods: The study included 76 children/adolescents (8-16 years). Poor decoders (n=31) were identified by deficient
single word reading ability (WJ-III letter word ID standard score <
90), while a sample of children with typical decoding skills (n=45)
served as a comparison group. Using FreeSurfer, whole-brain analyses
compared cortical thickness and local gyrification metrics between the
two reading groups, controlling for age. All results were thresholded
at p<0.01 and corrected for multiple comparisons using a cluster-wise
simulation method.
Results: Following vertex-wise general linear model analyses per hemisphere, children with poor decoding skills demonstrated thinner and
more gyrified cortex within the left inferior temporal region and left
temporal-parietal-occipital junction compared to typical decoders. Additional areas of reduced cortical thickness were observed in the left anterior cingulate and post central cortices, as well as the right hemisphere
precuneus, superior temporal and superior frontal cortices.

207
Conclusions: The convergence of thinner and more gyrified left inferior
temporal cortex in poor decoders may reflect its early temporal role in
processing word forms and highlights the importance of the ventral
stream for successful decoding. Meanwhile, the temporal-parietal-occipital junction defines a critical area of association cortex forming part of
the posterior neural network that underlies reading function in the brain.

B.M. HAMPSTEAD. A Direct Comparison of Medial Temporal
Lobe Volumes and Memory Using NeuroQuant® and FreeSurfer
in Healthy Controls and Mild Cognitive Impairment.
Objective: Although MRI-derived volumetric data are well established
in research, these methods have generally not been translated into clinical practice. NeuroQuant® is a fully automated program that may
bridge this translational gap. However, few studies have evaluated its
relationship with established methods like Freesurfer (considered the
“gold-standard” in the current study). This study examined 1) the correspondence between NeuroQuant- and Freesurfer-based medial temporal
lobe volumes in a mixed sample of healthy adults and mild cognitive
impairment (MCI) and 2) the relationship between these volumes and
memory test performance.
Participants and Methods: A mixed sample of 77 participants (26
healthy young controls; healthy older controls (HOC); 31 MCI) underwent magnetic resonance imaging and memory testing (via the Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS)
Delayed Memory Index (DMI)). We obtained the volume of the inferior
lateral ventricles (ILV), hippocampus (HP), and amygdala (AMG) using both NeuroQuant and Freesurfer. Using Pearson correlations, these
values were directly compared with each other and then with RBANSDMI performance.
Results: All NeuroQuant and Freesurfer volumes were significantly
correlated in the total sample (r > 0.615) as well as when we considered only the older participants (HOC&MCI, r >0.761), and only the
MCI patients (r >0.830). All Neuroquant and Freesurfer volumes were
significantly correlated with DMI in the total sample; however, only
the AMG and HP remained significant in the older participants. There
were no significant relationships between volume and RBANS-DMI in
the MCI group alone (likely due to sample size).
Conclusions: Findings suggest that NeuroQuant 1) provides a reasonable measure of medial temporal lobe integrity, especially in older
adults and 2) may finally make basic volumetric analysis feasible within
the general clinical community – a critical step to clinical translation
of research findings.

P.H. PANGILINAN & L.A. BIELIAUSKAS. The Relationship
Between Emotional Distress, Somatic Preoccupation, and
Neurobehavioral Symptoms in Veterans with Mild Traumatic
Brain Injury.
Objective: Originally developed as a measure of heightened somatic/
autonomic perception for back pain patients (Main, 1983), the Modified
Somatic Perception Questionnaire (MSPQ) has been shown to detect
exaggerated pain symptoms. Given the significant contribution of emotional distress to post-concussive symptoms (PCS), this study explored
the MSPQ as an indicator of emotional distress and PCS.

208
Participants and Methods: 104 Veterans underwent evaluation for
mild TBI and completed the MSPQ, neurobehavioral symptom inventory (NSI) and measures of emotional distress (Hospital Anxiety and
Depression Scale (HADS); PTSD checklist (PCL); Insomnia Severity
Index (ISI); Brief Pain Inventory (BPI)). Given high interrcorrelations
among these measures, a composite emotional distress variable (ED)
was calculated based on z-scores from the HADS, PCL, and ISI. TBI
injury variables were also explored (years since injury, longest period
of disorientation/ loss of consciousness).
Results: Correlations between NSI total and measures of emotional
distress ranged from r= .506-.744; TBI injury variables were minimally
correlated with NSI (r=.105-.151). Results from hierarchical regression
revealed that ED accounted for 64.4% of the variance in predicting NSI
total and 32.9% of NSI somatic; MSPQ explained an additional 2.9%
in NSI total and 11.4% of NSI somatic. The interaction between MSPQ
and emotional distress was not significant.
Conclusions: Emotional distress accounts for the largest variance in
PCS. Scores on the MSPQ do not seem to be related to the relationship
between emotional distress and PCS, but do provide a small contribution
to explaining variance in NSI total and NSI somatic. Results suggest that
the MSPQ provides an additional measure of emotional distress to that
obtained from other self-report measures, but its utility as a measure
of over-reporting of PCS symptoms is limited.

Long-term Cognitive Sequelae of Methanol Poisoning.
Objective: Methanol poisoning leads to lesions in the basal ganglia
(BG), subcortical white matter and to demyelination and atrophy of the
optic nerve. However, information regarding the evolution of cognitive
deficits in a large methanol sample is lacking. The main objective of
our study was to identify cognitive deficits due to methanol poisoning
in long-term perspective.
Participants and Methods: A total of 50 patients with confirmed methanol poisoning were included in this longitudinal cross-sectional study.
We compared their cognitive performance in two points in time (2013,
mean age: 47.34 ± 13.51, education: 11.96 ± 1.98 and 2015, mean age:
49.08 ± 13.52). We administered a comprehensive neuropsychological
battery, which included following domains: global cognitive functioning,
attention, memory, executive functions and psychomotor and motor
speed measures. The data were not normally distributed and we used
Wilcoxon signed rank test.
Results: The cognitive performance between of methanol sample between 2013 and 2015 was significantly worse in following test measures:
MMSE (Md (2013) = 28, Md (2015) = 27, p = .019); Stroop Dots (Md
(2013) = 12, Md (2015) = 13, p = .014). However, the performance
was also significantly better in Grooved Pegboard Test right hand (Md
(2013) = 83, Md (2015) = 76, p = .036) and BDI-II (Md (2013) = 10.5,
Md (2015) = 5, p = .047).
Conclusions: Long-term cognitive impairment after methanol poisoning in two years perspective seems to include an evolution of worsening
in global cognitive functioning and attention (MMSE, Stroop-D) despite
significantly lower level of depressive symptoms in BDI-II. However, the
evolution includes also a better cognitive functioning in some of motor
speed measures (GPT).

L.O. RAMIG & J.C. BOROD. Evaluation of Facial Emotional
Expression: Parkinson’s Disease and Gender Effects.
Objective: Facial expressivity impairment is a common symptom of
Parkinson’s disease (PD) that negatively impacts social interaction and
relationships with family, peers, and healthcare providers (e.g., Brozgold
et al., 1998). We examined multiple aspects of facial emotional expression to better understand facial expressivity deficits in individuals with
PD. In addition, we examined gender differences in facial emotional
expression.
Participants and Methods: Participants included 62 individuals with
idiopathic PD (77% male) and 18 demographically matched Healthy
Controls (61% male). To examine facial expression, participants were
videotaped while producing emotional (happy, sad, & angry) and
neutral monologues using elicitation procedures from the New York
Emotion Battery (Borod, Welkowitz, & Obler, 1992). Monologues were
divided into 15-second segments, which were randomized and evaluated
by 24 naïve raters on Likert scales (from minimal to maximal) for 4 different aspects of facial expression, including emotional frequency (EF),
emotional variability (EV), emotional intensity (EI), and non-emotional
facial mobility (FM).
Results: Three-way mixed-model Analyses of Covariance (Group [2]
X Gender [2] X Monologue Type [4]), with the Beck Depression Inventory-II score as the covariate, were conducted for each of the 4 facial
variables. We found a significant difference between PDs and HCs for
all 4 variables (i.e., EF, EV, EI, & FM), with PDs rated as significantly
lower than HCs. In addition, women were significantly more expressive
than men for all of the facial variables (i.e., EF, EV, EI, & FM).
Conclusions: Overall, our findings confirm and extend the literature
documenting facial expressivity and mobility impairments in PD as well
as gender differences in facial emotional expression. A better understanding of specific aspects of the facial expressivity impairment in PD
can help to inform rehabilitation treatment as well as assist healthcare
professionals interacting with and treating this population.

Neuropsychological Phenotypes in Essential Tremor and
Parkinson’s Disease Patients.
Objective: The complete relationship between Parkinson’s disease (PD)
and Essential Tremor (ET) is unclear, highlighted by overlapping clinical features (Jimenez-Jiminez et al., 2011). Neurocognitively, both often
demonstrate similar patterns of impairment (Cudaback et al., 2015).
Previous studies attempting to simultaneously assess cognitive functioning in ET and PD patients were restricted by small samples and limited
cognitive batteries employed (Lee et al., 2015; Ozen Barut et al., 2015).
In the present study, differences in PD and ET were investigated using
a more robust battery of tests within the same data set, allowing for a
more direct comparison of these overlapping clinical populations.
Participants and Methods: Retrospective review was conducted of 43
participants, with 25 PD (13 male; 12 female) and 18 ET (10 male and
8 female) patients referred for routine neuropsychological assessment
as part of standard pre-operative, deep brain stimulation, protocols.
ET and PD served as the independent grouping variable in MANCOVA
analysis. Age served as a covariate, with cognitive test variables as dependent variables.
Results: Group performance varied on measures of premorbid intellectual estimation (F = 6.21 (1,2), p = .02) and word-list discrimination (F
= 5.81, p = .021). Broadly, the PD demonstrated the greatest impairments in learning and delayed memory; whereas ET patients displayed
the greatest deficits on retrieval and semantic fluency.
Conclusions: Present findings support previous data suggesting similar
cognitive deficits in PD and ET patients, emphasizing the role of frontosubcortical circuitry in both groups. However, our findings suggest

unique differences between the two populations, which may reflect
unique pathological characteristics influencing varied presentations of

Neuropsychological Predictors of Levodopa Equivalent Dose in
Parkinson’s Patients Undergoing Deep Brain Stimulation.
Objective: Conventional treatment of Parkinson’s disorder (PD) often
involves pharmacotherapy with levodopa (L-dopa) and typical benefits
are offset by significant side effects and eventual reduced efficacy (Zittel
et al., 2011). L-dopa equivalent dose (LED) provides a metric of medication burden and indirect proxy of disease severity (Tomlinson et al.,
2010). Studies of surgical interventions for Parkinson’s disease, including deep brain stimulation (DBS), have utilized LED as a post-operative
outcome (Matzke et al., 2015). Relatively little, however, has been done
to explore the relationship between neuropsychological data and LED.
We attempt to extend this literature in a sample referred for DBS.
Participants and Methods: A comprehensive neuropsychological battery was administered to a sample of 12 subjects (5 males; 7 females).
LED’s were calculated using the guidelines of Tomlinson et al. (2010).
LED change was determined through paired T-tests. Stepwise regression
explored predictive value of neuropsychological data on post-operative
LED.
Results: Significant change in post-operative LED scores were observed
t (11) = 2.227, p = .05. Pre-operative LED accounted for significant
variance in the initial model, b = .702, t (11), p = .01. Inclusion of the
summary cognitive scores contributed significantly to the model, F (1,
11), p = .01, R2 = .681, R2Adjusted = .610.
Conclusions: In many cases, unless a frank dementia syndrome is ascertained, patients may still undergo DBS regardless of their level of
impairment. Our data suggests a unique relationship between neuropsychological performance and surgical outcome measures (i.e., levodopa
equivalent dose). As such, the role of neuropsychological data in DBS
decision making may be useful, along with other demographic and medical data, in identifying optimal candidates for DBS.

Neuropsychological, Mood, and Quality of Life Impact of Weight
Status in Parkinson’s Disease.
Objective: Little is known about the relationship between body mass
index (BMI), cognition, and quality of life (QoL) in Parkinson’s disease
(PD) despite a growing literature documenting obesity’s detrimental
impact on cognition, mood and QoL.
Participants and Methods: 72 patients were classified into NIH BMI
categories (underweight N=2, normal N=20, overweight N=29, obese
N=19, morbidly obese N=2). It was hypothesized that obese and overweight participants would have poorer QoL, executive function, impulse
control, and more depressive symptoms than those of normal weight
or underweight.
Results: The number of WCST categories (p=0.05) attained was greater
in the morbidly obese than the underweight or normal weight groups.
BMI (r=.31, p<.01) and BMI classification (r=.34, p<.01) were associated with the number of categories. Subgroups of underweight and
normal weight participants experienced a longer disease duration than
those in the obese and morbidly obese group (p=.07). BMI was inversely related to disease duration (r=-.24, p=.04). Disease duration
was related to WCST perseverative errors (r=.34, p<.01) and inversely
related to number of categories (r=-.40, p<.01). PDQ-39 Bodily Discomfort (higher score indicates greater dissatisfaction) was related to BMI

209
classification (r=.24, p=.04). BMI was not associated with impulsivity
or depression.
Conclusions: The finding of an inverse association between PD duration and BMI is not unexpected. Weight loss is common in PD and may
reflect diminished energy intake and/or higher energy expenditure. In
this case, the better executive functioning in those with higher BMI is
probably secondary to shorter disease duration and less extensive fronto-striatal degeneration. However, in such a scenario one might then
expect greater bodily discomfort in those with longer disease duration
and lower BMI instead of the obtained finding of poorer QoL in obesity.
A limitation of this study was sample size and homogeneity.

cognition in Huntington disease.
Objective: The insidious and progressive nature of Huntington disease
(HD) often impedes assessment of cognition. New Neuro-QoL (www.
neuroqol.org) self-report measures of cognitive health-related quality
of life (HRQOL) offer additional information about HRQOL, but have
not yet been compared to objective measures of cognitive functioning.
Participants and Methods: 536 individuals with HD completed two
self-report measures of cognition (i.e., Neuro-QoL General Concerns
and Executive Functioning) and three objective measures of cognition
(Symbol Digit Modalities Test, Verbal Fluency, and Stroop Interference). Bivariate correlations (controlling for age and education) were
examined among self-report and objective cognitive performance. ANOVAs were conducted to determine if self-report measures could differentiate: 1) between those with high vs low performance on objective
measures (determined by median split); and 2) among individuals with
prodromal, early-, and late-stage HD (determined by Total Functional
Capacity scores from UHDRS).
Results: Self-report measures demonstrated low to moderate correlations with all objective measures of cognition (r range: 0.15 to 0.38).
In general, individuals with more self-reported cognitive concerns had
poorer performance on objective measures (p <0.001, except for Neuro-QoL General Concerns and Verbal Fluency, p>0.05). In addition,
individuals with prodromal HD indicated fewer self-reported concerns
than those with either early- or late-HD, and individuals with early-HD
reported fewer cognitive concerns than those with late-HD for self-report
measures (all p<0.001).
Conclusions: In HD, self-reported cognition provides different information from objective cognitive performance measures. Given the importance and discriminant validity of self-reported cognition, both self-report and objective measures should be used to assess cognition in HD.

J.H. KRAMER. Predictors of Functional Ability in Corticobasal
Degeneration and Progressive Supranuclear Palsy.
Objective: Corticobasal degeneration (CBD) and progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) are atypical parkinsonian disorders related to 4-R tau
that are characterized by prominent motor difficulties (gait abnormalities, postural instability, rigidity, and alien limb). Cognitive deficits and
neuropsychiatric symptoms are also typically present. Currently, the
degree to which these different symptom types contribute to functional
impairment is poorly understood. Our goal was to assess the independent
contributions of cognitive, movement, and neuropsychiatric symptoms
on functional independence.
Participants and Methods: We studied 33 CBD and 36 PSP patients
who completed a comprehensive neurological assessment that included

210
the unified Parkinson’s disease rating scale (UPDRS-motor). Memory
and executive function factor scores were derived from a standard neuropsychological exam. An informant completed the Functional Activities
Questionnaire (FAQ) and the Neuropsychiatric Inventory Questionnaire
(NPI).
Results: Partial correlations controlling for age and MMSE showed that
the FAQ correlated with memory and executive scores, UPDRS-motor, and several NPI domains (delusions, agitation/aggression, apathy,
disinhibition, irritability, aberrant motor behavior, appetite/eating
changes). These variables were entered in a linear regression that explained 46.2% of the variance in FAQ. Follow-up regressions controlling
for all other predictors showed that irritability had the most unique
variance (20.9%), followed by UPDRS-motor (7.3%), memory (7.3%),
and executive functions (4.1%).
Conclusions: Motor, cognitive and neuropsychiatric symptoms all
contribute to functional deficits in PSP and CBD, with the best predictors being irritability, parkinsonism, memory, and executive functions.
These findings highlight the importance on non-motor symptoms in two
syndromes historically considered to be primary movement disorders,
and support the need for cognitive and neuropsychiatric assessment in
PSP and CBD patients.

about the association with medical self-management skills. Type 1 diabetes (T1D) self-management is often complex, and mismanagement
can result in hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia and associated morbidity
and mortality. Older adults with T1D may be at higher risk given normal
aging and disease related cognitive decline.
Participants and Methods: The T1D Exchange conducted a case-control study evaluating factors associated with severe hypoglycemia in
older adults with longstanding T1D. Neuropsychological (Symbol
Digit Modalities Test; SDMT, Trail Making Test; TMT, Hopkins Verbal Learning Test-Revised; HVLT-R, and the Grooved Pegboard Test;
GPT) and functional (Diabetes Numeracy Test; DNT, and Functional
Activities Questionnaire; FAQ) measures were administered to 201 older
adults (age 60-86 years) with T1D duration of 20-73 years from 18
diabetes centers across the US.
Results: After adjusting for confounding variables, diabetes numeracy
was related to memory (Hopkins Verbal Learning Test – Revised) and
complex speeded attention (SDMT), with the overall model accounting
for 27% of the variance; while the FAQ was associated with simple
processing speed (TMT A), executive functioning (TMT B), complex
speeded attention (SDMT) and dominant hand dexterity (GPT), with
the overall model accounting for 29% of the variance. The severity
of overall cognitive deficit (as assessed by global deficit scores) was
uniquely associated with both diabetes numeracy and FAQ, when controlling for age, education, frailty and depression.
Conclusions: This study demonstrates that cognitive impairment in
older adults with T1D has functional implications for both diabetes
specific everyday skills and more general instrumental activities of daily
living. Further research is needed to determine specific interventions
to maximize diabetes self-management in older adults with declining
cognition.

M. DEMIAN, R. SHAPIRO & W.L. THORNTON. Health Literacy
Predicts Medication Adherence in Kidney Transplant Recipients
Beyond the Effect of Common Indicators of General Literacy.
Objective: Poorer health literacy (HL) has been linked to worse disease
management in various medical populations. We have previously shown
that lower HL is a risk factor for worse medication adherence in kidney
transplant (TX) recipients. The current objective was to clarify the role
of HL in predicting medication adherence in kidney TX recipients after
controlling for the effects of other common indicators of general literacy
(i.e., educational level, verbal intelligence, and knowledge).
Participants and Methods: 96 stable adult kidney TX recipients
participated. HL was assessed by the Health Literacy Questionnaire
(HLQ). Verbal IQ was assessed by the KBIT-II. Knowledge of medication management was measured by the Everyday Cognition Battery.
Self-reported medication adherence was measured by the TX Effects
Questionnaire- Adherence subscale. Correlational and hierarchical linear regression analyses were used to clarify the associations between
HL and adherence.
Results: Male gender (r=-.34, p<.01), younger age (r=-.22, p<.05)
and lower HL were associated with poorer adherence (r=-.35, p<.01).
Decreased knowledge of medication management (r=.21, p<.05) and
lower levels of verbal IQ (r=.23, p<.05) were associated with lower HL
levels. Notably, lower HL levels significantly predicted poorer adherence
after controlling for the effects of age, gender, educational level, verbal
IQ, and knowledge of medication management (ΔR2=.09, p<0.01). Additional analyses revealed that lower levels on the following 6 HL factors
were significantly associated with poorer adherence: social support (r=.38), reading and understanding information (r=-.34), having sufficient
information (r=-.34), navigating the healthcare system (r=-.31), active
engagement with healthcare providers (r=-.28), and healthcare provider
support (r=-.27).
Conclusions: HL is a unique predictor of poorer medication adherence
and is not redundant with other common indicators of general literacy.
Interventions to improve adherence can target the 6 specific factors of
the HLQ.

Predictors of Fall Risk in Parkinson Disease.
Objective: To determine which variables are most predictive of fall
history to identify a comprehensive model of fall risk in Parkinson disease (PD).
Participants and Methods: 64 patients (Mage=66.6[9.7]; Meduc=15.4[2.2]) with PD were administered a neuropsychological battery and divided into high (>=2 falls; n=32) and low (0-1fall; n=32)
fall risk based on number of falls over the prior 6 months. Separate
stepwise logistic regression analyses were conducted to identify predictors of high/low fall risk from four domains: cognitive (Block Design,
Digit Span, Trail Making Test B, Rey-Osterrieth Copy, and California
Verbal Learning Test-2 [CVLT-II]), impulsiveness (Barratt Impulsiveness Scale-11 [BIS-11] and Questionnaire for Impulsive-Compulsive
Disorders in Parkinson’s Disease-Rating Scale), disease characteristics
(postural instability, disease duration, and age), and balance confidence
(Activities-specific Balance Confidence Scale). Significant predictors
from each regression were included in a fifth “combined” model. Model
comparisons were conducted using net reclassification improvement
to determine if the combined model significantly improved fall risk
prediction.
Results: Each stepwise logistic regression yielded significant results
(p<.20). The combined model was significant for postural instability
(OR=8.66), verbal learning (CVLT-II; OR=0.95), and behavioral impulsiveness (BIS-11; OR=1.10). The combined model had the highest
rate of correct high fall risk classification (83%) and was significantly

Forty Fourth Annual INS Meeting Abstracts
better than the disease characteristics (p=.04) and cognitive (p=.03)
models but not the impulsiveness model (p=.12).
Conclusions: Postural instability was the best predictor of fall risk;
though incorporating cognitive and impulsiveness measures improved
prediction of falls. Screening for impulsiveness and verbal learning deficits in addition to postural instability as part of routine clinical care may
help better identify patients at higher risk of falls.

W. WHARTON. Associations Between Cognitive Functioning and
the JNC-8 Guidelines for Hypertension in Older Adults.
Objective: Guidelines for hypertension treatment by the Eighth Joint
National Committee (JNC-8) in 2014 recommend a target blood pressure (BP) of <150/<90 mmHg in persons > 60 years old, in contrast to
the 2003 JNC-7 recommendations of BP <140/<90 mmHg for this age
group. The current study evaluated the impact of these different BP
target cutoffs on cognitive functioning and the conversion from normal
cognition to mild cognitive impairment (MCI).
Participants and Methods: This was a longitudinal observational
study of individuals > 60 years old who were participants in the NIHNIA Alzheimer’s Disease Centers. All had normal cognition at baseline
and received 4 annual assessments of BP, cognition, and functional
status. Four hundred and fifty two participants were taking BP medications and had readings of <140/<90 at all visits (within the target range
according to both sets of guidelines; reference group). Two other groups
consisted of participants with either systolic BP of 140-149 mmHg
(elevated according to JNC-7 guidelines but not according to JNC-8;
N=112) or >150 mmHg (elevated according to both sets of guidelines;
N=280) on 3 or 4 visits.
Results: Compared to the reference and the 140-149 mmHg groups,
those with BP >150 mmHg exhibited lower cognitive performance in
year 4 on the Mini-Mental State Exam and had a higher risk of conversion to a diagnosis of MCI. However, attention/working memory and
set shifting were poorer in the 140-149 mmHg group compared to the
reference group.
Conclusions: Findings of lower cognitive performance in some domains
for the140-149 mmHg group indicate the need for further research
evaluating the implications of the JNC-8 hypertension cutoffs on cognitive functioning.

T.J. FARRER, D. ATTIX & T. MONK. Post-Operative Delirium
Fails to Predict Cognitive Functioning Longitudinally.
Objective: This study aimed to identify whether post-operative delirium predicts cognitive decline 12-18 months post-surgery in a cohort
of older adults.
Participants and Methods: One hundred fifty-three elders (mean
age=73.9, mean education=14.1) undergoing elective orthopedic surgery completed cognitive testing at baseline (T1) and at short-term
(T2; 3-6 mo.) and long-term (T3; 12-18 mo.) follow-ups. Executive
and Memory Composite scores were calculated across time points and
change from T1 to T3 was the primary outcome of interest. Potential
predictors of memory and executive function decline from T1-T3 were
age, education, and post-operative delirium.
Results: Delirium and non-delirium groups did not differ in age, education, or sex. Those with postoperative delirium had significantly worse
composite memory scores (M= –.25, SD=.75) at T3 compared to those
without delirium (M=.24, SD=.85); t(124)= 2.16, p =.032. The difference in the executive composite at T3 reached marginal significance;
t (117)= 1.94, p = .054). Regression analysis revealed that change in
memory from T1 to T3 was not related to age (β=-.01, t(120) = .-1.13,

211
p =.26), education (β=.016, t(120) = 1.0, p =.32)., or post-operative
delirium (β = -.089, t(120) = .-.56, p =.57). Change in the executive
function composite from T1 to T3 was also not related to age (β = -.011,
t(107) = .-1.6, p =.10), education (β = .013, t(107) = 1.01, p =.31), or
post-operative delirium (β = -.004, t(107) = -.03, p =.97).
Conclusions: In this study, delirium does not appear to predict change
in cognition longitudinally, despite differences in cognition between
those who developed delirium and those who did not at follow-up. Understanding the bidirectional relationship between delirium and longterm cognition will require additional research on possible moderating
factors such as cortical volume, white matter integrity, and severity and
duration of delirium.

B. MILLER & J.H. KRAMER. Rate of Cognitive Decline in PSP vs.
CBD.
Objective: Progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) and corticobasal degeneration (CBD) are 4R tau neurodegenerative diseases characterized
by parkinsonian symptoms and cognitive deficits. PSP and CBD share
similar cognitive characteristics, but little is known about the differences
in their rate of cognitive decline over time. The current study addresses
said differences longitudinally over 3 visits.
Participants and Methods: Clinically diagnosed PSP (n=24) and CBD
(n=19) patients completed several neuropsychological measures at 3
visits, with an average duration of 2.1 years between visit 1 and 3.
B values derived from linear regressions represented rate of cognitive
decline. Independent sample t-tests assessed differences at baseline and
in rate of decline.
Results: Cognitive scores between the two groups were similar at baseline with the exception of PSP subjects scoring higher on MMSE (24.8
vs. 27.5; p<.05) and confrontation naming (11.5 vs.14.4; p<0.001).
CBD patients showed a faster rate of decline on several executive tasks,
including lexical fluency (p<.05), semantic fluency (t=-3.17, p=0.003)
and digits backward (t=-3.23, p=0.003) than the PSP group. MMSE
also dropped more rapidly (p<.01), while there were no differences in
verbal delayed memory, confrontation naming, semantic fluency, visual
construction, or set-switching.
Conclusions: CBD was associated with a faster rate of decline in executive functioning and MMSE relative to PSP over a 2-year period.
These findings highlight that despite several similarities in pathology
and clinical presentation, important longitudinal differences in cognition
may distinguish between PSP and CBD and improve differential diagnosis. Atrophy of the frontal lobes is also more characteristic for CBD
than PSP, which could explain differences in rate of executive decline
(Lee et al., 2011; Boxer et al., 2006).

K. MCCOY. Cardiovascular Risk Models Predict Processing Speed
Performance: Initial Evidence from a Veteran Sample.
Objective: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk models assist providers
in identifying at-risk patients as well as needed treatments. Meta-analyses indicate several CVD risk models show an inverse association with
performance on tests of attention, executive functioning, and memory;
although often slowed in CVD, processing speed was not evaluated. The
purpose of this study was to assess the relationship between the QRISK2
model and processing speed in a veteran sample.
Participants and Methods: Participants included a mixed-clinical
sample of 184 veterans without history of physical disease or injury
likely to impact processing speed referred for neuropsychological
evaluation. QRISK2 composite risk scores (10-year and relative risk)

212
were calculated for each veteran (Mage=58.1, SD=14.3; Meducation=13.4,
SD=3.1; 87% men). Bivariate correlations evaluated the relationship
between risk scores, depression, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and processing speed (PSI) from the WAIS-IV. Hierarchical multiple regression
evaluated risk values as predictors of PSI while controlling for education,
OSA, and depression separately for young, middle, and older adults.
Results: Mean 10-year risk of CVD/stroke was 17.6% (SD=14.7%),
with a relative risk of 1.98 (SD=1.32) compared to healthy controls. In
middle age, OSA, depression, and low education were related to higher
relative risk of CVD/stroke. Bivariate correlations revealed a trend of
decreasing education and increasing QRISK2 association with PSI as
age increased. Regression revealed QRISK2 values were significant (p =
.015) and accounted for 7% of the variance in PSI for those over age 65.
Conclusions: CVD risk models were a significant predictor of processing speed in a clinical sample of veterans, although education accounted
for the most PSI variance in early and middle adulthood. These findings
extend previous research on CVD risk models and relationships with
neuropsychological functioning to include cognitive efficiency.

M. WATERS, T. BEAVER & C. PRICE. Regional Leukoaraiosis,
Lacunes, and Cognition in Atrial Fibrillation: A Pilot Investigation.
Objective: There is limited understanding of regional leukoaraiosis
(LA) versus burden of lacunar infarctions and peripheral strokes on
cognition in adults with atrial fibrillation (AFib). We assessed regional
load of LA as well as lacune and peripheral stroke volume in adults with
AFib relative to non-AFib peers. We additionally examined if regional
LA versus lacune and stroke volume contributed differently to cognition
in these two groups.
Participants and Methods: 17 AFib patients and 17 controls completed memory, processing speed, and verbal fluency tests as well as
structural MR imaging for LA, lacunae and stroke volume. Trained
raters measured LA in three regions (infracortical, deep and periventricular) in order to assess LA that may differentially impact short versus
long U-fibers, as well as lacunae (0.3-1.5mm in diameter) and stroke
(>1.5mm in diameter) volume. Analyses examined group differences
in neuroanatomical and cognitive variables, and hypothesized relationships between regions of LA and areas of cognition. We controlled for
total intracranial and total white matter volume.
Results: Individuals with AFib had significantly more LA, particularly in the infracortical white matter region, relative to their peers.
Lacunes and strokes were present in 9/17 (53%) and 11/17 (65%)
of patients with atrial fibrillation, respectively. There was no evidence
of lacunar infarction or strokes in control participants. Cognitively,
individuals with AFib performed worse on measures of memory and
fluency (p<.01). Memory recognition negatively correlated with total
LA (p=.024) infracortical LA volume (p=.017), and lacune volume
(p<.001). Lacune volume also related to inhibition (p=.036). Stroke
volume was not related to any cognitive domain.
Conclusions: AFib patients have significantly more LA, lacune and
peripheral stroke volume relative to non-disease peers. Infracortical
LA burden and the lacune volume were significantly associated with
reduced memory performance with no relation seen between memory
and larger strokes.

Cognition and Parkinson’s Disease: the Influence of Health
Comorbidities and Leukoaraiosis.
Objective: Mounting evidence has pointed to the detrimental effects
of cardiovascular risk factors on cognition. One prevailing view is that

hypertension affects cognition via ischemic changes that disrupt frontal-subcortical connections. We examined if Parkinson’s disease (PD)
patients are at increased vulnerability for vascular-related cognitive
impairment relative to controls. The underlying assumption behind this
hypothesis relates to ‘brain reserve’. The cognitive profile of individuals with PD is a frontal-subcortical dysexecutive profile. As such, PD
patients may be vulnerable to vascular-related cognitive impairment
(which also affects frontal-subcortical systems).
Participants and Methods: The sample included 67 PD patients and
61 elderly controls (total N = 127). Participants completed neuropsychological measures of executive functioning, processing speed, verbal
delayed recall/memory, language and auditory attention. Cardiovascular risk was assessed with the Framingham Cardiovascular Risk index.
Participants underwent brain imaging (T1 and T2 FLAIR). Total and
regional leukoaraiosis (periventricular, deep subcortical and infracortical) was measured by a trained rater.
Results: Overall sample characteristics: 70% male, age 67.7 years, disease duration (Parkinson patients only) 9.7 years, Unified Parkinson’s
Disease Rating Scale (Parkinson patients only) 20.4. Hierarchical regressions revealed that cardiovascular risk was related to worse executive functioning (p=.013), processing speed (p=.035) and delayed verbal
recall (p<.001) in Parkinson patients and Controls. Cardiovascular risk
was related to language performance among Parkinson patients only.
Leukoaraiosis was related to both cardiovascular risk and cognition
among controls, but not Parkinson patients.
Conclusions: Overall results suggest that PD patients generally are not
more vulnerable to vascular-related cognitive impairment. Rather, the
influence of cardiovascular risk factors on cognition is similar among
PD patients and controls.

J.L. STORBECK. Attentional Engagement Underlies Rey Complex
Figure Test Performance in Systemic Lupus Erythematosus.
Objective: Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) is associated with
deficits in attention, executive functioning, visuospatial functions, and
memory. Individuals with SLE have shown marked impairment on the
Rey Complex Figure Test (RCFT), but mechanisms underlying poor
performance have not yet been elucidated. The goal of this study was
to explain performance on the RCFT through associated performances
on other measures of cognition and qualitative analysis of individual
components of RCFT performance.
Participants and Methods: Eighteen individuals with SLE (17 F, 1 M;
age = 42 ± 10.77 years) completed the RCFT, Trailmaking Test (TMT),
and Judgment Line Orientation (JLO). The RCFT performances were
scored and normed using the standard method and the Boston Qualitative Scoring System (BQSS). TMT, JLO, and BQSS scores were used
as predictor variables in a regression model.
Results: RCFT copy trial performance positively correlated with TMT
A and BQSS scores on configural presence, cluster accuracy, neatness,
and perseveration. These variables together predicted RCFT copy performance (R = .94, r2 = .89, p. < .01), but only neatness (p. < .01),
perseveration (p. = .03), and TMT-A (p. = .05) emerged as independent
predictors. Positive correlations with the delay trial included TMT-A,
TMT-B, configural placement, cluster placement, and detail presence
and placement. The regression model was significant (R = .87, r2 =
.80, p. < .01) with independent predictions from TMT-A and cluster
placement performances.
Conclusions: Performance on the RCFT copy and delay trials is associated with measures of attention and processing speed in people
with SLE. These findings suggest that simple attentional focus and
efficiency underlie cognitive deficits in people with SLE. Future research
is needed in order to understand the contribution of higher order attentional mechanisms, such as engagement and initiation, in cognitive
functioning within the SLE population.

A. BURLESON, R. ZIMMERMAN & M. LOCKSHIN. Functional
MRI Abnormalities in Systemic Lupus Erythematosus and
Antiphospholipid Antibody Positive Patients.
Objective: Standardized cognitive tests and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies of SLE patients demonstrate deficits in
working memory and executive function. These neurobehavioral abnormalities are not well studied in antiphospholipid syndrome (APS),
which may occur independently of or together with SLE. This study
compares an fMRI paradigm involving motor, working memory and
executive function in SLE patients without antiphospholipid antibody
(SLE), aPL-positive non-SLE patients (aPL+), and controls.
Participants and Methods: Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI),
functional MRI (fMRI) and standardized cognitive assessment were obtained on 20 SLE (mean age 36.5, SD=11.7), 20 aPL-positive (mean
age 37.6, SD=8.6) and 10 healthy female subjects (mean age =40.4,
SD=11.8) with no history of neuropsychiatric activity.
Results: Analysis of fMRI data showed no differences in performance
across groups on bilateral motor tasks. Significant group differences
using ANOVA were found on two executive tasks (word generation
and word rhyming) and in a working memory task (N-back). Patients
positive for aPL demonstrated higher activation in bilateral frontal, temporal and parietal cortices compared to controls during tasks of working memory and executive function. SLE patients also demonstrated
bilateral frontal and temporal activation during working memory and
executive function tasks.
Conclusions: Compared to controls, both aPL positive and SLE patients had elevated cortical activation, primarily in the frontal lobes,
during tasks of working memory and executive function. These findings
are consistent with cortical over-activation as a compensatory mechanism for early white matter neuropathology in these disorders.

E. KOZORA, M. NITTA, K. BROWN & N. HAMZEH. Symptom
Presentation and Cognitive Dysfunction in Patients with
Sarcoidosis.
Objective: Sarcoidosis is a systemic disorder of unknown etiology
causing the formation of granulomas that can appear in any organ
but typically in the lungs, lymph nodes, eyes and skin. Neurological
presentations occur in 10%, but few studies have evaluated cognitive
deficits in this population.
Participants and Methods: Twenty-eight patients with a primary diagnosis of sarcoidosis completed cognitive testing as part of their clinical
care between 2000 and 2015. The subjects were 75% female, 93%
Caucasian, had a mean age of 53.3 (SD=9.2) years, a mean education
of 15.2 (SD=2.6) and a mean duration of disease of 7.0 years (SD=9.0).
Results: Analysis revealed a range of symptoms/disorders including
pulmonary (60%), cardiac (33%), sleep apnea (50%), hearing loss
(48%) and visual problems (41%). Minor neurological events occurred
in 85% of the sample (67% headaches, 41% numbness and pain, 35%
balance problems). Clinical interpretation of cognitive data indicated
that 21% were in the normal range, 50% were mildly impaired, 11%
were mildly to moderately impaired and 18% were moderately impaired. Patients had one or more tests impaired in learning in memory
(82%), attention (71%), motor function (67%), problem solving (64%),
expressive language (57%), visuoconstruction (21%), and receptive
language (18%). Over 35% of the group had symptoms of depression
on the BDI-II. No associations using correlational analysis were noted
between level of cognitive impairment, duration of disease, prednisone
use or depression.

213
Conclusions: Our findings indicated that 79% of the patients with
sarcoidosis referred for cognitive evaluation were impaired. Case by
case presentations indicate there is a wide variety of organ involvement and neuropsychiatric presentations across individuals with sarcoidosis. Larger sample sizes across multiple sites may be necessary to
better identify factors that contribute to cognitive dysfunction in this
population.

S. LEVY, A. BOETTCHER, K. DAVIDSON, C. CATANIA, D.J. LIBON
& C. PRICE. No Titanic Effect on Digit Symbol in Idiopathic NonDementia Parkinson’s Disease.
Objective: Subcortical illnesses such as Parkinson’s disease (PD) are associated with decreasing output over time on tasks requiring processing
speed and mental flexibility. This negative slope as a function of time
to completion/and or test epoch has been termed the ‘titanic effect’. We
examined differences in WAIS-III Digit Symbol Coding quartile performances for non-demented individuals with and without idiopathic PD.
We hypothesized that individuals with PD would show reduced output
and greater slowing over time relative to controls after correcting for
Digit Symbol copy performance.
Participants and Methods: Forty non-dementia individuals with PD
(mean age= 67.8±5.44; mean education= 16.28±3.03) and 40 non-PD
peers (mean age= 68.18±4.64; mean education= 16.75±2.35) completed the WAIS-III Digit Symbol Coding and Copy subtests. Total
correct responses were counted by 30-second quartiles (30”, 60”, 90”,
120”). Repeated Measures ANOVA assessed changes in quartile mean
scores over time.
Results: Although there was a significant effect of group (p=0.02) showing decreased output overall for PD relative to non-PD, there was no
significant interaction of group by quartile. Both the PD group (t=3.22,
p< .01) and the control group (t=2.78, p < .01) declined in output from
30 seconds to 60 seconds. Output generated by PD participants did not
continue to decline in subsequent test epochs.
Conclusions: While our PD participants had reduced output relative
to controls, there was no significant decrement over time or evidence
of increased bradyphrenia by quartile. For PD without dementia, there
may be a certain threshold of cognitive impairment that must be met
before significant decrements over time can be seen. Future studies
should examine bradyphrenia across the span of task in PD individuals
with mild cognitive impairment or dementia. R01 NS082386 (CP)

S. LEVY, J.J. TANNER, D. BOWERS & C. PRICE. One-Year Reliable
Change of Cognition and Mood in Idiopathic Non-Dementia
Parkinson’s Disease.
Objective: The progression of Parkinson’s disease (PD) cognitive and
mood changes over time remains poorly understood. We examined cognitive and mood changes in idiopathic non-dementia PD participants
from baseline to 1 year. Based on frontal-striatal circuitry disruption
evidenced in PD, we hypothesized that PD participants would have primary decrements in processing speed, attention, and working memory
and increased mood symptoms relative to controls.
Participants and Methods: Forty PD and 40 control participants completed a comprehensive baseline and one year neuropsychological protocol. For PD participants, mean disease duration was 8.75 (SD = 5.37)
and mean UPDRS-III scores was 17.95 (SD = 8.80). Repeated Measures
ANOVA and reliable change methods assessed group differences and
individual changes over time in cognition and mood.
Results: Cognition: There was a significant effect of group (p < .001)
such that PD showed worse cognitive performance overall relative to
non-PD. There was a significant group by time interaction (p < 0.01)

214
such that PD exhibited decrements in processing speed and non-PD
showed improvements in attention, memory, and motor function. After
one year, reliable change analyses revealed that 16.2% of PD participants declined in working memory and 10.8% in attention. Mood: There
was a significant effect of group (p < .001) such that PD participants
showed greater depressive, apathetic, and anxious symptoms relative to
controls. There was no significant interaction of group by time. At one
year, 16.7% of PD participants experienced an increase in depressive
symptoms, 5.5% in apathy, and 18.9% in state anxiety.
Conclusions: Cognition in PD progressed from processing speed to
additional impairments in working memory and sustained/selective attention. Depressive and anxiety symptoms also significantly increased
within the year. These changes support concepts of increased frontal-striatal deficits over time and the need to intervene on processing
speed early in the disease process. R01 NS082386 (CP)

S.W. LIEBEL, S.J. BRYANT, U.S. CLARK & L.H. SWEET. Cognitive
Processing Speed Mediates the Relationship between Age and
Executive Functions in Cardiovascular Disease.
Objective: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is associated with cognitive
impairments, including slowed cognitive processing speed (CPS) and
impaired executive functions (EF). An extensive research literature suggests that CPS is a fundamental component of many of the brain’s other
functions; yet, relatively little research has explored the effects of CPS
on EF in CVD. The present study examined the potential mediating role
of CPS on the age-EF relationship in CVD.
Participants and Methods: Thirty-seven patients with CVD and 58
healthy older adult controls completed a neuropsychological and MRI
assessment. A composite score for CPS and EF was formed with unitweighted Z-scores of constituent tests to provide stable measures of
ability in these domains. Pearson correlation coefficients established
the significant relationship between the independent variable (age) and
dependent variable (EF). Partial correlations controlling CPS examined
possible attenuation of the age-EF relationship. Mediation analyses were
conducted via PROCESS for SPSS. Statistical significance was set at p
< .05, two tailed, for all tests.
Results: In the patient group, the relationship between age and EF (r
= -.47, p = .003) was significantly attenuated by controlling CPS (r =
-.06, p = .74). Mediation analysis revealed that there was a significant
indirect effect of age on EF ability through CPS (b = -.039, BCa CI
[-.079, -.017]); this represents a moderate effect (κ^2 = .366, BCa CI
[.135, .607]). In the control group, the age-EF relationship (r = -.57,
p < .001) was attenuated by controlling CPS as well (r = -.331, p =
.012). Similar mediation results were found through CPS (b = -.024,
BCa CI [-.047, -.008]) and represent a moderate effect (κ^2 = .284,
BCa CI [.120, .444]).
Conclusions: CPS partially mediates the relationship between age and
EF in both CVD and healthy control groups. These findings support the
role of CPS as a fundamental component of EF.

D. SONG, S.L. LESSIG & D.M. SCHIEHSER. Clinical Correlates of
Sleep Disturbance in Non-demented Parkinson’s Disease Patients.
Objective: Sleep disturbance is common in individuals with Parkinson’s
disease (PD), yet the relationship among sleep quality and neuropsychiatric, cognitive, motor, and disease symptoms is not well delineated.
Such knowledge may help elucidate the nature of sleep disturbance in PD
and provide potential targets for sleep assessments and/or interventions.
Participants and Methods: Non-demented PD participants (n =116)
completed the 15-item Parkinson’s Disease Sleep Scale (PDSS), a measure of self-reported PD-specific sleep disturbances. Participants were

administered measures of global cognition (Mattis Dementia Rating
Scale), motor symptom severity (Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating
Scale Part III), and neuropsychiatric symptoms (Neuropsychiatric Inventory). Postural Instability Gait Disturbance (PIGD) and Tremor
Dominant (TD) motor subtype scores were also calculated.
Results: Increased sleep disturbances were significantly correlated with
overall motor symptom severity (r = -.20, p < .05), but not with global
cognition or psychiatric symptoms. Further analyses of motor symptoms
revealed that greater levels of sleep disturbance significantly related
to greater levels of PIGD symptoms (r= -.32, p < .01), but not TD
motor scores. Poorer sleep quality also correlated with higher levodopa
equivalent dose (LED, r = -.23, p < .05), but not with disease duration.
After controlling for LED in a hierarchical regression analysis, greater
postural instability/gait disturbance continued to significantly predict
sleep disturbance.
Conclusions: Results suggest that postural instability/gait disturbance
is a unique predictor of sleep disturbance in non-demented PD. The
relationship between PIGD and sleep disturbance may be related to
dysfunction in non-dopaminergic (e.g., cholinergic) systems; however,
further research is needed to better understand the nature of this relationship. Moreover, findings provide potential treatment targets (i.e.,
motor symptoms) for future treatment studies of sleep disturbances
in PD.

A. O’MARA & S. WYLIE. The Effects of Subthalamic Nucleus (STN)
Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) Across Phonemic, Semantic and
Action Fluency Measures in Parkinson’s Disease.
Objective: Subthalamic nucleus (STN) deep brain stimulation (DBS)
improves motor symptoms in Parkinson’s disease (PD), but can reduce
phonemic and semantic verbal fluency performance. Reduction in the
spontaneous retrieval of action-related words (action fluency) is an
early feature of PD, but the effects of STN DBS on action fluency are
unknown. Here we compared the effects of STN DBS across phonemic,
semantic and action fluency measures.
Participants and Methods: PD patients (N=19) without dementia
completed phonemic, semantic, and action fluency measures before and
6 months following DBS surgery in their best treated state. Raw performances were converted to age and education adjusted scaled scores and
submitted to repeated measures ANOVA to test within-subject effects of
task (phonemic, semantic, action) and timepoint (pre DBS, post DBS).
Results: Consistent with prior studies, PD patients showed a selective
reduction in action fluency, but intact phonemic and semantic fluency
scores pre-DBS. Post-DBS surgery, all three fluency measures showed a
significant decline, but semantic fluency showed a significantly greater
decline compared to phonemic and action fluency measures.
Conclusions: We confirmed a selective reduction in action fluency
among PD patients, but show that STN DBS exerts a global reduction
in spontaneous word production, irrespective of the lexical content.
We consider putative mechanisms underlying these effects and discuss
why semantic fluency measures may be particularly vulnerable to STN
DBS effects.

S. PAQUETTE, P. FOURNIER, S. DUPONT, F. SZABO, P. GALAN
& S. SAMSON. A Compromised Neural Noise-Cancellation
Mechanism at the Center of Tinnitus Perception.
Objective: Tinnitus incidence is rising due to an aging population and
an increase in day-to-day noise exposure. Tinnitus has typically been
viewed as having an exclusively auditory origin, mainly because it is an
auditory percept and is often triggered by specific auditory conditions,
such as noise trauma causing hearing loss. This said, experts estimate

Forty Fourth Annual INS Meeting Abstracts
that only a third of those with hearing loss will go on to develop tinnitus. Although many theories on its neurological underpinning exist, no
studies have identified why tinnitus only occurs in specific individuals.
According to Rauscheker and collaborators (2010), dysfunctional limbic
noise cancelling mechanisms could be responsible for tinnitus perception
after hearing loss. To test this hypothesis, we investigated the prevalence
of tinnitus in a population of patients with a dysfunction of the amygdala
in a case control study.
Participants and Methods: One hundred and sixty-six patients who
had undergone unilateral medial temporal lobe resection (including
the amygdala) for the relief of medically intractable epilepsy were contacted to take part in this epidemiologic study on tinnitus. Specifically,
data were collected regarding the subjects’ general health and audition.
Data obtained from these patients was compared with data from paired
healthy (n=332) and epileptic (n=332) controls taken from the French
epidemiologic database Nutrinet-Santé (Hercberg et al., 2010).
Results: As predicted, we found that 23.5% of epileptic patients who
underwent median temporal lobe resection including the amygdala reported experiencing tinnitus. This prevalence is significantly different
from the paired non-epileptic (3.7 times higher) and epileptic (2.5 times
higher) controls, although it increases with age in all groups.
Conclusions: The present findings support the idea that a compromised
neural noise-cancellation mechanism could be responsible for tinnitus
perception, and provides convincing evidence for the crucial role of the
amygdala in this phenomenon.

Following Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation.
Objective: Severe aortic stenosis may lead to angina, syncope, and heart
failure (Otto, 2006). Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI)
was developed as an alternative to surgical valve replacement in patients
denied surgical candidacy due to mortality risk (Kappetein et al., 2013).
Despite increased risk of ischemia following TAVI (Rodes-Cabau et
al., 2011; Kahlert et al., 2010), cognitive function appears stable with
potential improvements (Ghanem et al, 2013, Alassar et al., 2015). The
present study examines the relationship between TAVI and cognition.
Participants and Methods: Forty TAVI patients (79.04±7.79 yr) completed neuropsychological evaluations at baseline and at one-month
post-TAVI. Twenty-two participants completed brain MRIs at baseline
and one month. Assessments included the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), the Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS), Stroop Color-Word Test, Trailmaking Test,
and letter fluency. Measures of quality of life (KCCQ), mood (GDS),
and ADL’s (PSMS, FAQ) were included.
Results: Participants evidence mild global cognitive decline at baseline
relative to normative sample (RBANS Total Index M = 85.26±14.69).
Significant improvement at one month was observed in RBANS Language Index (p = 0.014), RBANS Fluency (p = 0.023), RBANS Figure
Recall (p = 0.027), GDS (p = 0.018), and KCCQ (p < 0.001). There
was a significant decline on RBANS List Recall (p = 0.001). Six patients
(27%) evidence ischemia at one month. Participants with ischemia did
not differ from those without at one month (RBANS Total Score, p =
0.45).
Conclusions: Despite increased ischemia, patients who undergo TAVI
evidence improvement in quality of life, mood, and specific domains of
cognition, with overall cognitive functioning remaining stable. Improvement in cardiac symptoms, mood, and quality of life may be associated
with ability to engage in assessment and improvements in cognitive
performance. Increased perfusion, despite ischemia, may also improve
cognitive performance.

O.L. REY & L. MURRAY. Cognitive Performance of Hypertensive
Adults.
Objective: The goal of this project was to examine the association between hypertension (HT) and performance on tasks of processing speed,
attention, memory, language, visuoconstruction, and executive function.
Although the last 30 years have brought a rise in the amount of research
evaluating the cognitive effects of HT, the results of these studies have
been inconclusive. These inconsistent observations likely reflect methodological differences across studies regarding the selection of subjects
and measurements. The recent increase in the incidence and prevalence
of HT, and its known effects on brain anatomy and physiology, highlight
the current relevance of this issue.
Participants and Methods: A group of 82 healthy adults were evaluated with a battery of 12 cognitive tasks. Half of the subjects had a
diagnosis of HT and half did not. No significant differences between the
groups were observed in terms of age or educational level. BP readings
were obtained multiple times during testing sessions, following existing
guidelines issued by the American Heart Association. The average BP
was considered an independent variable for secondary analysis.
Results: ANOVA showed that the normotensive group obtained significantly higher scores than the HT group on processing speed, divided
attention, attentional switching, visual memory, visuoconstruction, and
most executive function tasks. This difference disappeared in most of the
tasks when the groups were reorganized using onsite BP measurements
as the independent variable. A logistic regression analysis yielded a
model that included attention, fluency, and verbal memory tasks as the
best predictors of subjects having or not having HT.
Conclusions: The current findings indicate that HT is associated with
cognitive decline in otherwise healthy adults. As such, it should be considered an important variable both when selecting control groups for
research studies on cognition and when accounting for influencing factors on the rehabilitation of subjects affected by brain damage.

L.E. SABBAH & I. PIRYATINSKY. Hashimoto’s Encephalopathy
Case Report.
Objective: Hashimoto’s encephalopathy (HE) is a rare neurological
disorder characterized by positive antithyroid antibodies, altered mental
status, and clinical response to glucocorticoid therapy (Chong, Rowland,
& Utiger, 2003). HE is often difficult to diagnose because it can present
with variable neurological manifestations and relapsing and remitting
disease courses (Nelson, Jassam, & Taylor, 2014).
Participants and Methods: We present a 76-year-old Russian speaking right-handed woman with recurrent UTIs, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, type II diabetes, and a diagnosis of HE made in May of 2012. MRIs
from her disease course and treatment will be presented. The patient was
diagnosed with relapsing-remitting course and treatment-refractory HE,
which was resistant to treatment and eventually successfully controlled
with plasmapheresis, corticosteroids, and azathioprine in January 2014.
MRI showing significant fluctuations with significantly impaired leukoencephalopathy, prompted a case study publication of her neurologic
and imaging findings (Nelson, Jassam, & Taylor, 2014).
Results: Her cognitive functioning was of significant concern, however,
due to language and cultural limitations, neuropsychological evaluation
was not conducted until she was referred to our clinic in February of
2015. The interview and assessment was conducted in the patient’s
native language, and included assessment of attention, processing speed,
learning, executive functioning, language, fine motor dexterity, visuospatial functioning, and memory. Psychiatric history was unremarkable. Significant cognitive impairment was noted as well as decline in
instrumental ADLs.

216
Conclusions: Profile was inconsistent with typical dementia process,
such as AD, FTD, PD, and this as well as neuropsychological findings
will be discussed in detail in the result section. This case report is an
interesting and rare presentation of a patient who has received treatment
for HE and was later diagnosed with major neurocognitive disorder in
February 2015.

R. SALAZAR & A. CRONIN-GOLOMB. Self-Perceived Stigma in
Parkinson’s Disease: Relation to Motor Symptoms, Age, Gender,
and Mood.
Objective: Parkinson’s disease (PD) may persist in a person for decades
with retained insight into the disease burden, and many with the disease
perceive that they are stigmatized. Little is known about how PD-related
demographic and disease characteristics relate to perceived stigma. We
predicted that certain aspects of PD that make it difficult to conform to
social norms would relate to self-perceived stigma, including visibility of
motor symptoms (e.g., tremor, rather than trunk rigidity), female gender
(societal emphasis on physical appearance in women), and younger age
(societal expectations of physical vigor in younger persons). We expected
that stigma would be associated with depressed or anxious mood.
Participants and Methods: We assessed 99 non-demented individuals
with PD (44 F, 55 M) on motor function (Unified Parkinson’s Disease
Rating Scale, UPDRS), subjective quality of life (Parkinson’s Disease
Questionnaire, PDQ-39), and mood (Beck Depression Inventory-II; Beck
Anxiety Inventory). The mean of the four stigma-related items of the
PDQ-39 was correlated with scores for the other aspects of PD.
Results: For the entire group, perceived stigma correlated with younger
age (r= -.26, p=.005), depression (r=.22, p=.018) and anxiety (r=.43,
p=.000) but not with UPDRS motor items. For men, stigma correlated
with depression (r=.34, p=.007) and anxiety (r=.48, p=.000). For
women, stigma correlated with anxiety (r=.37, p= .007) and younger
age (r=-.38, p= .006). The relation between age and stigma was strongest for women with tremor-dominant motor symptoms (n=17; r=-.44,
p=.039).
Conclusions: Self-perceived stigma in PD was related to mood, and for
women, it further related to younger age and tremor-dominant symptoms. The association of stigma perception with affective symptoms,
age and gender may be an important focus for interventions, especially
for younger women with physically obvious motor symptoms such as
tremor.

C. SINGER & B.E. LEVIN. Does REM Behavior Sleep Disorder Alter
Deep Brain Stimulation Outcome in Parkinson’s Disease?
Objective: Among patients with Parkinson’s disease (PD), the presence
of REM Behavior Sleep Disorder (RBD) is associated with a non-tremor
predominant subtype and gait freezing, and increased rate of dementia
(Bonnet et al., 2012). Deep brain stimulation (DBS) has been found to
be an effective treatment for disabling motor symptoms in PD (Parsons
et al., 2006). However, more research is needed to understand and identify patient characteristics that predict improvement or decline following
DBS surgery. Therefore, this pilot study sought to examine whether
RBD is an important factor linked to outcome following DBS surgery.
Participants and Methods: Participants were recruited from a larger
study in the Department of Neurology examining cognitive functioning
prior to and following DBS surgery. A total of 38 participants with
PD, 32 without RBD and 6 with RBD, were compared on a battery of
neuropsychological measures prior to and after DBS surgery. The two
groups did not differ on age, gender, or disease duration. Overall, the

sample was 84% male (Mage= 63.3 years, Meducation= 12.6 years, and
Mdisease duration= 12.5 years).
Results: Data were checked for normality, and measures of skewness
and kurtosis showed normal distribution on all variables used. A oneway analysis of variance (ANOVA) revealed that the non-RBD and RBD
groups did not differ on MMSE, verbal fluency, confrontation naming,
verbal learning, and visual spatial judgment and integration. Patients
with RBD did marginally worse only on digit span following DBS compared to their non-RBD peers, F(1,34)= 6.628, p= .015. In general, all
PD patients improved post-surgery.
Conclusions: This pilot study suggests that PD patients with and without RBD do not differ in cognitive outcomes following DBS. In fact, both
groups perform similarly. Thus, while RBD may be an important marker
for PD motor signs and disease progression, it does not appear to play
as significant a role for cognitive outcomes following DBS.

Differential effects of apathy, depression, and anxiety on cognitive
function in Parkinson’s disease, essential tremor, and dystonia.
Objective: The purpose of the present study was to (1) compare the
prevalence and severity of anxiety, apathy, and depressive symptoms
across three movement disorder patient groups; and (2) examine the
differential effects of mood on cognition. We hypothesized that due to
the link between dopamine and apathy, apathy would be greater in PD
patients and associated with executive function. Anxiety would be more
strongly linked to Essential tremor and related to memory.
Participants and Methods: Participants included 614 patients with
idiopathic Parkinson’s disease (PD=462), Essential tremor (ET=105)
and dystonia (DYS=47) evaluated at the University of Florida Center
for Movement Disorders and Neurorestoration. None had undergone
deep brain stimulation. All participants completed neuropsychological
evaluation and self-report mood measures: BDI, STAI and Apathy Scale.
Two cognitive composite scores were computed using mean z-scores: 1)
Memory: HVLT, WMS-LM delayed recall; and 2) Executive Function:
TMT-B, Stroop Color-Word, COWA.
Results: Participants ranged from 30-90 years of age, were well-educated (M=14.5), with mean DRS-2 total scores of 133.8. The 3 groups
did not differ in the severity and prevalence of mood symptoms, after
controlling for age, education, and disease duration. However, a trend
toward higher rates of apathy were found in PD and ET versus DYS
patients. Regression analyses indicated that for PD patients, both apathy
and state anxiety significantly predicted Executive Function (p<0.001),
with state anxiety also predicting Memory (p<0.001). Mood symptoms
did not predict cognitive composites in ET or DYS groups.
Conclusions: In contrast to our hypotheses, only the prevalence of
apathy differed across movement disorder groups. Even so, apathy and
anxiety each played an important role in the cognitive presentation of
PD patients but not the other movement groups. Findings will be discussed in terms of current views on mechanisms of cognitive disturbance
in movement disorder subgroups.

in student with high or low Internet use.
Objective: To examine impact of sleep loss on cognitive functioning
particularly attention. The study also examined the role of Internet use
on habitual sleep and its impact on cognitive functioning. The study
also examine the association between sleep chronotype and cognitive
functioning. Association between Internet use and cognitive functioning
was also examined. Gender difference related to sleep time, Internet use,
and cognitive performance was explored.

Forty Fourth Annual INS Meeting Abstracts
Participants and Methods: The participants for the current study were
recruited from APA accredited school with students enrolled in graduate
psychology program. The participants in the study were asked to maintain a sleep log for two weeks followed by on-site testing. Measures used
in the study were BDI-II, BAI, Epworth Sleepiness Scale, Fatigue Severity Scale, Internet Addiction Test, Morningness-Eveningness Questionnaire, Stroop Color and Word Test, and the Test of Everyday Attention.
Results: Significant group differences were found between individuals
receiving less than 6 hours of nocturnal sleep per night and those receiving 6 to 8 hours and more than 8 hours of sleep related to daytime
sleepiness, cognitive flexibility, sustained attention, selective attention,
attentional switching, and auditory/verbal working memory and attention. No group difference among sleep group were found related
to Internet use. Internet use was strongly associated with number of
electronic devices owned, as well as inversely related to Anxiety. Gender
difference were found related to Internet use and number of electronic
devices, but not for nocturnal sleep time.
Conclusions: Customary sleep average less than 6 hours per night can
impact cognitive functioning particularly attention and also leads to
excessive daytime sleepiness. Additionally, individuals who own more
electronic devices are prone to use Internet for extended period of time.
Adequate sleep is necessary for optimal cognitive functioning. Environmental and social factors such as Internet can lead to decline sleep time.

The Association Between Cognition and Depression on Disease
Severity in Huntington’s disease.
Objective: Depression is common in Huntington’s disease (HD). The
ubiquitous nature of depression in HD may explain why it poorly discriminates among different levels of disease progression. However, the
interaction between depression and cognitive symptoms in HD may
prove sensitive to monitoring clinical deterioration. We tested this hypothesis in a sample of HD patients with various levels of HD severity.
Participants and Methods: Forty-seven adults with HD aged 19-63
(M=42.68, SD=12.82) completed the Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS; age-adjusted total score
was used in the present study) and underwent motor and depression
ratings on the Unified Huntington’s Disease Rating Scale (UHDRS)
annually over two years. Outcome variables included motor progression
(M=21.27, SD=19.11) and total functional capacity score (M=10.18,
SD=3.42). Two mixed linear models investigating effects of time, cognition, depression, and time x depression x cognition (as well as lower
order) interactions were computed. Analyses controlled for age, gender,
and CAG repeats.
Results: The interaction between depression, cognition, and time on
motor functioning was not significant (p = .09) although there was a
main effect of cognition such that worse cognitive performance was
associated with worse motor functioning irrespective of time (p = .04).
Likewise, the interaction between depression, cognition, and time on
everyday functioning was not significant (p = .07) although there was
a main effect of depression such that greater depression was associated
with worse daily functioning over time (p = .03).
Conclusions: These preliminary results indicate that depression and
cognition may be associated with different aspects of disease progression. Larger samples may elucidate interactions between depression and
cognition on disease progression. Participant recruitment is ongoing.

Predicting Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) Outcome in Idiopathic
Parkinson’s Disease Patients.
Objective: It is well established that hypertension (HTN) and body mass
index (BMI), components of metabolic syndrome (MetS), are associated
with increased risk for Alzheimer’s disease. However, less known about
how these factors impact non motor symptoms in Parkinson’s disease
(PD). The current study examined whether diagnosis of HTN and/or
BMI prior to Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) surgery influences post-surgical cognitive and/or emotional outcomes.
Participants and Methods: 36 patients diagnosed with idiopathic
Parkinson’s disease (Mean age=63.53, SD=7.96) underwent pre- and
post- DBS neuropsychological evaluations. Patients underwent a neurological exam and were medically evaluated for HTN diagnosis (n=16
HTN, n=20 non-HTN) and BMI immediately prior to surgery and compared on verbal fluency (FAS, Animals), confrontational naming (BNT),
verbal memory (CVLT-II), and psychological outcomes (BDI-II, BAI).
Groups did not differ by sex, pre-surgical age, ethnicity, education, or
PD disease duration. Results were analyzed using linear regression and
analysis of covariance.
Results: Neither BMI nor HTN alone predicted change in cognitive or
psychological outcome. However, together they significantly predicted
change in semantic fluency (Animals; F(1,23), p=0.03), where for every kg/m2 unit increase in BMI, there was a 0.43 raw score decrease
(p=0.02). HTN diagnosis was associated with increased word production by 4.12 words (p=0.03), which may be explained by confounding
variables (i.e. HTN disease duration, medications, and/or effectiveness
of treatment).
Conclusions: HTN and BMI differentially influence neuropsychological
outcome post DBS surgery. These results suggest that BMI may heighten
vulnerability of verbal fluency performance following STN-DBS in PD.
Although PD has been associated with low cardiometabolic risk, these
data suggest that the individual components of MetS may collectively
interact in different ways.

Survivors.
Objective: Cognitive impairment in lung transplant candidates and
recipients is an important factor in decisions about candidacy and patient outcomes. Prior studies of patients with pulmonary disease have
had limited sample sizes or neuropsychological batteries. The objective
of this study was to thoroughly characterize cognitive dysfunction in a
large sample of lung transplant recipients.
Participants and Methods: 150 patients (Mean age = 59, SD=11) who
had lung transplant >/= 1 year prior to evaluation completed a battery
of neuropsychological tests in 5 domains: language (LANG), processing speed (PS), working/Immediate memory (WM), delayed memory
(MEM), and executive functioning (EF).
Results: Domain scores were created by averaging standard scores of
tests with similar cognitive demands. Analyses revealed that 68% of
patients scored at least 1.5 SD’s below the mean in at least one cognitive
domain and 16% scored at least 1.5 SD’s below the mean in 2 or more
domains. 36% scored below 2 SD’s in at least one cognitive domain and
6% scored below 2SD’s in more than one domain. The largest percentage
of patients scoring 1.5 SD’s or more below normative expectations was
in the PS domain (22%), followed by MEM (18%), EF (12%), WM
(11%), and LANG (5%).
Conclusions: The current study demonstrates a significant rate of
cognitive symptomatology for individuals with a history of pulmonary
disease and lung transplant. The cognitive domains affected implicate
medial temporal structures as well as frontal/subcortical systems. These

218
data provide more detail about the frequency and nature of cognitive
deficits in this population than has been previously available. Future
directions include confirmatory factor analysis to examine domain integrity, correlational analyses among cognitive scores and disease factors (hypoxia, comorbidities, etc.), and sensitivity/specificity analyses
of cognitive screening tools. Longitudinal studies to distinguish deficits
experienced prior to and after transplant are also being planned.

R. RUCHINSKAS, J. WHITE & M. CULLUM. Cognition and Balance
in Normal Pressure Hydrocephalus Pre- and Post-Lumbar Drain.
Objective: To examine cognition and balance in individuals with suspected normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH) pre- and post-lumbar
drain (LD).
Participants and Methods: 53 individuals with suspected NPH underwent neuropsychological (NP) and physical therapy (PT) assessments
before and after LD. NP tests included MMSE, Trail Making Test A &
B, Animal fluency, Hopkins Verbal Learning Test-Revised, and Digit
Span forward and backward. The Berg Balance Scale (BBS) was used
to assess balance. 27 subjects later received a diagnosis of NPH and
underwent a ventriculoperitoneal shunt placement (SH+) for treatment
and 26 did not undergo shunting (SH-).
Results: Frequency analysis showed the majority of patients in the SH+
group performed similarly or slightly better on NP tests following LD,
although no mean differences reached statistical significance. Paired
t-tests demonstrated a significant pre/post LD improvement on the BBS
[t(26)=-6.138, p<.01] [Mpre=37.67(9.85); Mpost=42.22 (9.90)] in the
SH+ group, but not in the SH- group. Frequency analysis revealed that
post-LD, the SH- group generally tended to perform slightly worse on
the BBS and cognitive measures when compared to the SH+ group;
however, no mean differences between groups reached statistical significance. There were no significant correlations between the BBS and
cognitive measures in either group.
Conclusions: Cognition and balance appear to be orthogonal in NPH,
suggesting that they are influenced by different underlying processes.
Cognition scores were generally stable and balance scores improved in
those with confirmed NPH. Furthermore, a trend toward worse balance
and cognition was found in those who were not selected for shunting.
These findings highlight the utility of combining NP and PT assessments
in the evaluation and management of NPH.

K.L. MOREAU, R.P. BOWLER & K.F. HOTH. Perceived Cognitive
Difficulties and Objective Neuropsychological Performance
in Former Smokers with and without Chronic Obstructive
Pulmonary Disease.
Objective: Smoking is the primary risk factor for chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease (COPD). Patients with COPD have cognitive deficits
in executive functioning, processing speed, and memory. This study
explored whether perceived cognitive difficulties are associated with
objective cognitive performance in former smokers. We hypothesized
that perceived cognitive difficulties would be associated with executive
and memory performance beyond depression and COPD status.
Participants and Methods: 95 former smokers recruited from the
COPDGene study completed questionnaires (perceived cognitive difficulties: Cognitive Difficulties Scale [CDS]; and mood: Hospital Anxiety
and Depression Scale [HADS]), neuropsychological assessment (memory recall, executive functioning, visual-spatial processing, and language), and pulmonary function testing (airflow limitation). Bivariate

Pearson correlations were conducted between the CDS and each cognitive domain. For significant correlations, simultaneous multiple linear
regression was used to determine if perceived cognitive difficulties were
associated with objective performance. The following covariates were
included: age, sex, pack-years, premorbid functioning (WRAT-IV Reading), HADS total, and COPD status (yes/no).
Results: Bivariate correlations were significant for the CDS and executive functioning (r=-.24, p<.05) and language (r=-.24, p<.05). Higher
perceived cognitive difficulties were associated with worse executive
functioning (β=-.072, SE= .034, p<.05), with significant covariates of
sex (p<.05), WRAT-IV Reading (p<.05), and COPD status (p<.05). Perceived cognitive difficulties were not associated with language (p>.05).
Conclusions: Perceived cognitive difficulties were associated with objective performance on executive functioning tasks in former smokers
beyond the effect of COPD status and depression. Clinicians should be
aware that cognitive complaints may be indicative of executive dysfunction in COPD and former smokers.

V.J. WASSERMAN, A. JAYWANT, M. KEMPPAINEN & A. CRONINGOLOMB. Parkinson’s Disease Affects the Perception of MotionDefined Gestures.
Objective: Parkinson’s disease (PD) is associated with altered social
cognition and visual perception. Little is known, however, about how the
disease affects perception of socially complex biological motion, specifically motion-defined communicative and non-communicative gestures.
We predicted that individuals with PD would perform more poorly than
normal control (NC) participants in discriminating between communicative and non-communicative gestures, and in describing communicative gestures. We related gesture perception to the participants’ level of
motor disability and gender, because action perception depends in part
on the integrity of the motor system, and there are gender differences
in social cognition in PD.
Participants and Methods: We assessed 23 individuals with PD (10
men) and 24 NC adults (10 men) who were matched for age and education level. Participants viewed point-light human figures that conveyed communicative and non-communicative gestures. Participants
were asked to describe each gesture and decide if the gesture was “communicative” or “non-communicative.” Motor disability was quantified
using the Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale. Social functioning
was assessed with the Social Adaptation Self-Evaluation Scale.
Results: Statistical analyses were conducted using ANOVA and Spearman rank-order correlations. PD as a group were less accurate than
NC in describing only non-communicative gestures (p < .01, Cohen’s
d = .82). Men with PD were impaired in describing and discriminating
between communicative as well as non-communicative gestures (p’s
< .09, Cohen’s d’s > .75). There was no correlation between gesture
perception and social functioning or motor disability in PD.
Conclusions: The present study demonstrated PD-related impairments
in perceiving and inferring the meaning of biological motion gestures.
Men with PD may have particular difficulty in understanding the communicative gestures of others in interpersonal exchanges. This research
was supported by NINDS grants F31NS078919 and R01NS067128.

Objective: Patients with Parkinson’s disease (PD), even in its early
stages, are known to demonstrate olfactory deficits. There is also evidence suggesting that asymptomatic relatives of individuals with PD
who demonstrate hyposmia, are at increased risk for developing PD

Forty Fourth Annual INS Meeting Abstracts
in the future. The purpose of this study was to compare measures of
olfaction as well as measures of information processing speed and performance variability in asymptomatic first-degree relatives of persons
with PD and matched controls.
Participants and Methods: Asymptomatic first-degree relatives of individuals with PD [FDR group; n=20, M(SD) Age=53.30 (7.13)] and
matched healthy controls [n=18; M(SD) Age=52.67 (9.42)] completed
the University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Tests (UPSIT) and
the Computerized Test of Information Processing (CTIP). The CTIP
includes three reaction time subtests that progressively increase in complexity and cognitive processing demands (i.e., a simple reaction time,
SRT; choice reaction time, CRT; semantic search reaction time, SSRT).
Results: Mean UPSIT scores did not differ between groups (p>.05).
Seven individuals (35%) in the FDR group scored below established
cutoff scores on the UPSIT compared with 3 individuals (16.7%) in the
control group (p>.05). Mean reaction times (RT) on the CTIP increased
with test complexity (all ps<.001) in both groups but there were no significant differences in mean RT between groups (p>.05). However, the
FDR group demonstrated greater performance variability on the SRT
task compared to healthy controls (p=0.02; Cohen’s d=.79).
Conclusions: There were no significant differences in olfactory performance between the first-degree relatives of individuals with PD and
controls. However, first-degree relatives demonstrated greater performance variability in reaction time.

H. ROBERTSON & J. FISK. Olfaction, Information Processing
Speed, and Performance Variability in Early Parkinson’s Disease.
Objective: Cognitive impairment and impaired olfaction are common
in Parkinson’s disease (PD) over time. However, sensitive measures of
cognitive changes in early stages of PD remain limited. The purpose of
this study was to examine olfaction, information processing speed, and
performance variability in early stage PD.
Participants and Methods: Individuals with early PD (n=16; modified Hoehn & Yahr stage 1-2.5) and healthy controls (n=18) were
compared. All PD patients were tested while taking their usual medications. Each participant completed the University of Pennsylvania Smell
Identification Tests (UPSIT) and the Computerized Test of Information
Processing (CTIP). The CTIP includes three reaction time subtests that
progressively increase in complexity and cognitive processing demands
(i.e., a simple reaction time, SRT; choice reaction time, CRT; semantic
search reaction time, SSRT).
Results: Participants with PD had poorer olfactory identification scores
on the UPSIT compared to healthy controls (p<.001); 87.5% of the PD
patients scored below established cutoff scores for the UPSIT. Mean
reaction time (RT) and intra-individual variability (IIV) on the CTIP
were analyzed using repeated measures ANCOVAs that included age as
a covariate; age was non-significant (ps>.05). Mean RTs increased with
test complexity on the CTIP (ps<.05) in both groups. PD patients were
both slower and more variable on all subtests of the CTIP (ps<.01). In
order to examine information processing speed independent of motor
speed, we examined performance on CRT and SSRT, while controlling
for SRT performance. Using this method, mean RTs for the PD patients
remained significantly slower on the SSRT task (p=.004) but not the
CRT task (p>.05).
Conclusions: Early-stage PD patients demonstrated poor performance
on a smell identification test. These individuals also demonstrated slower
response speed and more variable performance on computerized tests
of information processing speed.

K.L. DINH & A.M. RACH. Verbal fluency in parkinsonism with
and without dopaminergic deficiency on [123I]-FP-CIT SPECT
imaging.
Objective: There are no studies examining cognition in individuals with
parkinsonism who demonstrate normal dopamine uptake on [123I]FP-CIT SPECT imaging [i.e., Scans Without Evidence of Dopaminergic Deficiency (SWEDD)]. Verbal fluency deficits are often present in
parkinsonism; therefore the purpose of this study is to determine if
participants with SWEDD have similar verbal fluency performance to
those individuals who demonstrate dopaminergic deficiency on imaging.
Participants and Methods: Data for the present study were obtained
from Parkinson’s Progression Marker Initiative. Participants diagnosed
with idiopathic Parkinson’s disease were included in the study if they
completed tests of verbal fluency at baseline and 24-months and SPECT
imaging. Forty-two participants had SWEDD, while 255 participants
had evidence of dopamine deficiency. ANCOVAs were used to compare category and letter verbal fluency performance between the two
groups at baseline and 24-months, controlling for education and motor
symptom severity.
Results: At baseline, group differences in both letter and category verbal
fluency were not significant at p <.05. At 24-months, letter fluency performance was significantly worse in the SWEDD group compared to the
dopamine deficient group F(1, 293) = 9.72, p=.002, ηp2 = .032; as was
category fluency, F(1, 293) = 5.67, p =.019, ηp2= .019,after controlling
for education and motor symptom severity. Education was significantly
related to letter fluency, F(1, 293) = 33.69, p <.001, ηp2=.103, but not
category fluency. Motor symptoms were significantly related to letter
fluency, F(1, 293) = 6.50, p =.011, ηp2= .022 and category fluency,
F(1, 293) = 5.76, p = .017, ηp2= .019.
Conclusions: Among individuals with parkinsonian symptoms, individuals with SWEDD have significantly worse verbal fluency after
24-months than those with dopaminergic deficiency on SPECT imaging.
The results suggest deficits in verbal fluency, in some individuals with
parkinsonism, seem to be related to changes outside of the dopaminergic
system.

R.W. SCHROEDER. Equivalency of verbal fluency categories
among older adults with Parkinson’s disease.
Objective: Deficits in category fluency are common among patients with
Parkinson’s disease. While different categories have been used to measure verbal fluency across studies, research comparing the equivalency
of categories has examined raw scores rather than standardized scores,
limiting clinical utility and interpretation. The purpose of the current
study is to examine equivalency of performance across three different
semantic categories when standard scores are utilized.
Participants and Methods: Data from the Parkinson’s Progressive
Marker Initiative (PPMI) were used in this study. This study examined
249 participants with Parkinson’s disease over the age of 60 (M = 67.63
± 5.25). Average education was 15.71 (± 3.37) years. Mean symptom
duration was 21.78 (± 22.01) months.The sample was 68.7% male
and 95.2% Caucasian. Three verbal fluency categories were administered: animals, vegetables, and fruits. Raw scores were converted to
z-scores using normative age-based data. Repeated-measures ANOVA
was conducted to compare means of verbal fluency performance across
categories.
Results: Mauchly’s test indicated the condition of sphericity had been
met, χ2 (2) = 0.991, p =.32. There was a significant effect of verbal
fluency category on cognitive performance, F(1.78, 442.03) = 383.85,
p <.001, ω2 = .064. Pairwise comparisons using a Bonferroni correction
revealed significant findings: Participants performed better on animal
fluency (M= -0.05 ± 0.93) than vegetable fluency (M= -0.54 ± 1.12)

220
and fruit fluency (M= -0.45 ± 1.15); however vegetable fluency and
fruit fluency performances did not differ significantly.
Conclusions: Verbal fluency categories are not equivalent in older
individuals with Parkinson’s disease, even when using age-corrected
standardized scores. Clinicians should be aware of these differences
when selecting and interpreting category fluency tests in this population.
Further research is needed to determine which category is most accurate
in detecting impairments in semantic fluency.

Logopenic Primary Progressive Aphasia based on FDG-PET.
Objective: The logopenic variant of primary progressive aphasia
(lvPPA) appears to be heterogeneous based on differing clinical presentations, and on varying patterns of hypometabolism observed on
fluorodeoxyglucose 18-F positron emission tomography (FDG-PET).
This study investigated differences between left temporal predominate
and left parietal predominate variants of lvPPA, classified based on
predominant pattern of hypometabolism on FDG-PET.
Participants and Methods: Fifty-four patients were diagnosed with
lvPPA and underwent neurological and neuropsychological evaluations,
apolipoprotein genotyping, and FDG-PET. All were amyloid-positive
with Pittsburgh Compound B (PiB) PET. Patterns of FDG-PET hypometabolism were qualitatively assessed by five investigators who
reliably classified all 54 patients into left temporal predominate and
left parietal predominate groups. Demographic, neuroimaging, genetic,
neurological and neuropsychological profiles were compared across both
groups.
Results: Thirty-nine patients were classified as temporal predominate
and 15 as parietal predominate. There were no significant differences
between groups on demographic measures, language tests, apolipoprotein E genotype, or global PiB deposition. Individuals with the parietal
predominate pattern demonstrated significantly greater behavioral dyscontrol, lower recall and recognition on memory measures, and more
impaired cognitive flexibility (false discovery rate = 0.05).
Conclusions: We have demonstrated that lvPPA is not a homogeneous
syndrome. A subset of patients with lvPPA, characterized by predominant parietal hypometabolism, show greater cognitive dysfunction and
more behavioral features than the more typical temporal predominant
lvPPA.

H.S. LEVIN. A Preliminary Investigation of Stress Symptoms and
Cognitive Control-Related Brain Function Following OEF/OIF
Deployment.
Objective: Cognitive functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)
paradigms have found altered activation in subjects with posttraumatic
stress symptoms (PTSS). These changes have included decreased activation within association cortex, especially frontal areas involved
in executive functions, as well as increases within others involved in
emotion, autonomic regulation, and basic sensory and motor functions.

However, the previous studies had used a global PTSS score. The present
investigation used individual cluster scores to examine relationships
with avoidance-numbing (AN), hyperarousal (H), and re-experiencing
(RE) symptoms.
Participants and Methods: A cognitive control fMRI paradigm (i.e.,
Arrows Task) was used to examine 15 subjects who had been deployed
to Afghanistan or Iraq, seven of whom had scores above 38 on the
Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist (PCL-C). Image correlation
analyses were completed for each of the three PCL-C cluster scores,
Results: Within the full sample the analyses for all three PCL-C cluster
scores revealed negative correlations consistent with suppressed activation throughout large portions of the brain. When high PCL-C subjects
were examined separately both positive and negative correlations were
significant. More extensive suppression was observed within temporal
lobe structures for RE, while AN and H had suppressed right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex activation that was not found with RE. Higher
scores on all three PCL-C clusters were associated with enhanced activation within right anterior insula, but only RE also had increases
within the left insula.
Conclusions: While engaging cognitive control the elevations on all
three PCL-C cluster scores were associated with neural dysfunction.
Despite high overlap for suppressed activation, there were also unique
areas for each PCL-C symptom cluster. Areas with enhanced activation
were more constrained and the only one that was common to all PTSS
was the right anterior insula, a structure involved in interoception and
autonomic regulation.

Non-Pharmacologic Treatment of Memory Deficits
in Mild Cognitive Impairment

B.M. HAMPSTEAD. Non-Pharmacologic Treatment of Memory
Deficits in Mild Cognitive Impairment.
Memory deficits characterize Alzheimer’s disease and its clinical precursor amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI). While a growing
body of research furthers our understanding of the detection, characterization, and neuroanatomy of these memory deficits, the clinical
translation of these findings has lagged. So, providers continue to be
faced with the critical question of “What can I do about it?” Treatment is typically limited to a handful of medications that are, at best,
marginally successful. This limitation has fostered a growing interest
in non-pharmacologic treatment methods for minimizing learning and
memory deficits, approaches that include cognitive training and cognitive rehabilitation. These techniques hold promise but remain poorly (or
mis-)understood. In this session, I will first discuss several key methodological issues that plague cognitive training (CT) and cognitive rehabilitation (CR) in aMCI. I will then use a hierarchical model to evaluate
whether common techniques used in CT and CR (e.g., spaced retrieval,
mnemonic strategies) are beneficial for teaching specific content versus
enhancing a general cognitive process. Finally, I will discuss the use of
non-invasive electrical brain stimulation as another promising treatment
approach that may enhance cognition directly or indirectly via interactions with cognitive intervention. Examples from ecologically-relevant
memory paradigms that we have developed will be included throughout
and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) evidence of technique-dependent change will be used to discuss possible mechanisms
of action. Patient-specific predictors, such as neuropsychological performances and brain volumes, will be integrated since these factors are

Neuroanatomical Substrates of Executive Functions: Beyond
Prefrontal Structures.
Objective: Executive functions are often considered lynchpin “frontal
lobe tasks”, despite evidence that a network of anterior and posterior
structures supports them. We assessed whether prefrontal grey matter
volumes independently predict executive function performance when
statistically differentiated from global atrophy and individual non-frontal lobar volume contributions.
Participants and Methods: All community-dwelling participants
(n=202) were administered comprehensive executive function measures
and a subset (n=183) obtained neuroimaging. We developed a latent
variable model to decompose lobar grey matter volumes into a global
factor and specific lobar volumes that were independent of global grey
matter. We then added mean fractional anisotropy (FA) for frontoparietal white matter regions to the models.
Results: Results suggested that the 2-factor model (cognitive control,
updating/working memory) plus a speed factor best explained our data.
Global grey matter was related to the executive function and speed
variables in all four lobar models, but none of the effects testing incremental contributions of lobe-specific volumes were significant. In
contrast, when assessing the effect of white matter FA, cingulum FA
made independent contributions to updating/working memory (β=.25)
and corpus callosum FA was independently related to cognitive control
(β=.24) and speed (β=.31).
Conclusions: Study findings indicate that while prefrontal grey matter
volumes are associated with measures of executive functions in older
adults, they do not independently predict executive functions when
statistically isolated from global atrophy and individual non-frontal
lobar volume contributions. In contrast, better microstructure of frontoparietal white matter continued to predict executive functions after
accounting for global grey matter atrophy. These findings contribute to a
literature suggesting that prefrontal contributions to executive functions
cannot be viewed in isolation from more distributed grey and white
matter effects.

Study of the executive function network after focal stroke to
frontal lobe, cerebellum, thalamus or pons.
Objective: Executive impairments are primarily associated with frontal
lobe damage, but functional imaging and lesion studies have also identified subcortical regions critical to normal executive function. Previous
studies propose the presence of feedforward fronto-ponto-cerebellar and
feedback cerebello-thalamo-frontal loops within the executive network.
It remains unclear if focal damage to any location along this network
results in similar rates of executive impairment. We compared the frequency of executive impairments after focal unilateral stroke to the
frontal lobe, cerebellum, thalamus and pons.

221
Participants and Methods: Eighty-four patients (ages 32-90; 67%
male; mean education=14.9 years; mean age=59.7 years) who sustained a unilateral stroke were tested an average of 4 months after
injury. Patients who sustained unilateral frontal lobe (N=23), cerebellar
(N=25), thalamic (N=19), and pons (N=17) strokes received measures
of phonemic fluency, mental flexibility, organization, practical problem
solving and abstract reasoning. Exclusion criteria included multifocal or
bilateral stroke based on MRI of the brain and a MMSE score below 25.
Results: There were no between-groups differences in demographic
variables. Frontal lobe, cerebellar and thalamic strokes had similar rates
of impairment on mental flexibility tasks (58% frontal, 52% cerebellar,
and 47% thalamic; Fisher’s exact test p>0.05). Thalamic and frontal
lobe strokes had significantly higher rates of impairment on phonemic
fluency compared to cerebellar and pons strokes (67% frontal, 65%
thalamic, 45% cerebellar, and 44% pons; p values <0.05).
Conclusions: About half of patients who sustained a stroke in the
fronto-ponto-thalamo-cerebellar loop exhibited executive difficulties.
Damage to the network appears to result in a type of disconnection
dysexecutive syndrome.

A.K. MILLER & M.R. BASSO. Neuropsychological and Behavioral
Correlates of Impulsivity among Substance Abusing Women.
Objective: Individuals who abuse drugs and alcohol are apt to behave
impulsively (Nielsen et al., 2012) and prone to manifest neuropsychological impairment, especially executive function deficits (Kalechstein &
Newton, 2007). Diminished executive function and impulsive tendencies
may diminish an individual’s ability to act purposively and persist in
goal-directed behaviors. Completing treatment for substance misuse
requires sustained effort and self-control, which may be diminished by
impulsivity or poor executive function. The present study examined the
impact of impulsivity and executive function on treatment outcomes
among women enrolled in a court-ordered substance abuse treatment
program.
Participants and Methods: 53 women (age: M=32.55; education:
M=10.64) were administered the UPPS-P, a self-report measure of impulsivity (Cyders et al., 2007), and a battery of neuropsychological tests,
including the Iowa Gambling Task (IGT) and Color-Word Interference
and Verbal Fluency subtests from the D-KEFS at the start of treatment.
Six-months later, treatment outcomes were assessed (i.e., continued
status in treatment, therapist ratings of treatment engagement, and
self-reported distress).
Results: Multiple regression evaluated the relative importance of the
UPPS-P and measures of executive function in predicting treatment
outcomes. The IGT, D-KEFS Color-Word Interference and Verbal Fluency subtests, and UPPS-P achieved significance (p’s<0.05) and the
semi-partial correlations ranged from 0.18 to 0.61.
Conclusions: Measures of executive function and a self-report measure of impulsivity predicted treatment response for substance abusing
women. Worse executive function and higher impulsivity predicted
worse treatment outcomes. The results have meaningful implications
for future treatment planning. For example, patients with compromised
executive function or elevated impulsivity might benefit from a treatment approach that emphasizes concrete, specific, and practical advice
and problem-solving assistance (Bates et al., 2002).

Early lead exposure in children. Is there a neuropsychological
effect?
Objective: Despite a significant decrease in blood level concentrations in
children, childhood lead exposure continues to be one of the most critical
and preventable environmental problems among childhood diseases.

222
In 2012, CDC guidelines for childhood lead poisoning were decreased
from 10 μg/dl to the 5 μg/dL level. This study investigated the effect of
childhood lead exposure on attention and executive functioning (EF).
Participants and Methods: Neuropsychological data from 205 children (age 5-17 yrs : M=10.27, SD=3.04) seen in a neurodevelopmental
clinic were linked to state health department records of blood lead testing. Children were categorized based on their highest level of lead (high
(HLL)=≥5 μg/dL, n=72; low (LLL)= ≤4 μg/dL, n=133); lead level was
also assessed continuously.
Results: Groups were comparable in age and Full Scale IQ, although
the LLL group was more likely to be diagnosed with ADHD. On attention measures (CPT-II), the HLL group made more commission errors
t (49.029) =2.235, p=.03 and a weak but significant correlation was
found between lead level and commission errors (r=.231, p=.031). Parent ratings of EF difficulties (BRIEF) indicated the LLL group showed
greater metacognitive difficulties t(95)=2.150, p=.034; there was a
trend in this direction for the Global Executive Composite t(95)=1.929,
p=.057. No differences were found when examined continuously.
Conclusions: The results suggest that high levels of lead exposure have
an impact on individual measures of attention as assessed via laboratory
measures. In contrast, parents may not be as aware of the impact of lead
on EF in everyday life. Further research using longitudinal designs and
non-clinical controls is needed

D.A. NATION, N.D. EVANGELISTA, M.W. BONDI & L. DELANOWOOD. Cortical Amyloid Burden in Empirically-Derived Mild
Cognitive Impairment Subtypes.
Objective: We examined positron emission tomography (PET) imaging
levels of cortical beta-amyloid, a hallmark protein in Alzheimer’s disease (AD), across empirically-derived mild cognitive impairment (MCI)
subgroups and cognitively normal older adults.
Participants and Methods: 584 ADNI participants (445 MCI, 139
normal controls [NC]) underwent florbetapir PET amyloid imaging and
neuropsychological testing. Of those with ADNI-diagnosed MCI, a previous cluster analysis (Bondi et al., 2014) classified 51% of the current
sample as Amnestic MCI, 8% as Dysexecutive/Mixed MCI, and 41% as
belonging to a Cluster-Derived Normal (i.e., cognitively normal) group.
Results: The Dysexecutive/Mixed and Amnestic MCI groups showed
significantly greater amyloid deposition relative to the Cluster-Derived
Normal and NC groups who did not differ from each other. Approximately 78% of the Dysexecutive/Mixed MCI, 62% of the Amnestic MCI,
41% of the Cluster-Derived Normal, and 34% of the NC group exceeded
the threshold for amyloid positivity. We found a group by apolipoprotein
E (APOE) genotype interaction whereby, relative to APOE ε4 non-carriers, ε4 carriers within the Amnestic MCI, Cluster-Derived Normal, and
NC groups showed greater amyloid deposition. Within the Dysexecutive/
Mixed MCI group, who showed greater cognitive impairment and may
have been farther along in the disease course, amyloid deposition did
not differ between APOE ε4 carriers and non-carriers.
Conclusions: Empirically-derived MCI subtypes show considerable
heterogeneity in florbetapir PET amyloid levels. The group x APOE
interaction raises the possibility that, among APOE ε4 carriers, amyloid
may play a larger role early in the disease course compared to those
without an ε4 allele. Our findings further support that conventional
criteria for MCI are susceptible to false positive diagnostic errors, and

underscore the notion that amyloid deposition may be nonspecific given
its common occurrence across heterogeneous cognitively impaired and
normally aging groups.

M. MILLER & M. ALBERT. Cortical Thickness and Cognitive
Reserve in Relation to Clinical Symptom Onset in Preclinical AD.
Objective: We examined whether cortical thickness in ‘AD vulnerable
regions’ was related to time to clinical symptom onset during preclinical
Alzheimer’s disease (AD), and whether cognitive reserve (CR) modified
this relationship.
Participants and Methods: These analyses included 240 participants
from the BIOCARD cohort who were cognitively normal and primarily
middle-aged at baseline (M age = 56 years). Participants have been followed for up to 19 years with annual clinical and cognitive assessments;
of the 240, 52 have developed MCI or AD dementia.
The average cortical thickness of ‘AD vulnerable regions’ was measured
from baseline MRI scans, including: 4 temporal, 3 parietal, and 2 frontal
regions (obtained from FreeSurfer). CR was indexed with a composite
score combining education and baseline scores on the National Adult
Reading Test and vocabulary. Cox regression models (co-varying age
and gender) were used to determine whether thickness in AD vulnerable
regions was associated with time to onset of clinical symptoms, and
whether CR modified this association.
Results: The mean time from baseline to clinical symptom onset was 7
years. Lower cortical thickness was associated with an increased risk of
progression from normal cognition to clinical symptom onset within 7
years (p = .03), but not with progression more than 7 years from baseline
(p = .95). Additionally, higher CR was associated with a reduced risk
of progression (p < .001). There was no interaction between CR and
cortical thickness in relation to risk of progression to symptom onset
within 7 years (p = .41).
Conclusions: Cortical thinning in AD vulnerable regions is detectable
in cognitively normal individuals several years prior to the onset of
clinical symptoms that are a harbinger of a diagnosis of MCI. These
results suggest that measures of cortical thickness and CR in preclinical
AD are independently associated with time to clinical symptom onset
within seven years.

M. BABICZ, M. THURSBY & A.L. JEFFERSON. Dissociating
Constructs Underlying Working Memory in Mild Cognitive
Impairment: A Competitive Queuing Analysis.
Objective: Competitive queuing (CQ) models of working memory (WM)
posit two hierarchical mechanisms: (1) excitatory parallel planning responsible for item activation; and (2) inhibitory competitive choice/
response suppression responsible for simultaneous item recall followed
by item suppression. The current research sought to dissociate these
mechanisms in participants with mild cognitive impairment (MCI).
Participants and Methods: Participants were drawn from the Vanderbilt Memory & Aging Project, a case-control longitudinal study investigating vascular health and brain aging, including single domain amnestic MCI (aMCI; n=58), multi-domain MCI (mMCI; n=46) and normal
controls (NC; n=124). WM was assessed with a seven trial 5-span backward digit span test. ANY ORDER recall (recall regardless of correct
serial position) defined CQ parallel processing; SERIAL ORDER recall
(recall in exact serial position) defined CQ competitive choice/ response

Forty Fourth Annual INS Meeting Abstracts
suppression. Serial order position effects, hippocampal volume, and
white matter hyperintensity (WMH) burden were also quantified.
Results: Adjusting for age and MOCA scores, groups differed for ANY
ORDER (p< 0.001) and SERIAL ORDER recall (p< 0.04). Within-group analyses found the expected recency effect (better recall for
serial order position 5 vs. serial order position 4; p< 0.001) for aMCI
and NC groups. However, progressively worse decline across all 5 serial
order positions was noted among mMCI participants (p< 0.01). Regression analyses found better SERIAL RECALL was associated with larger
hippocampal volume (beta= 0.231; p< 0.02).
Conclusions: In mMCI reduced ANY ORDER/ SERIAL ORDER and
recency effects suggests WM impairment involving both CQ mechanisms. In aMCI WM deficits may be limited to impaired CQ inhibitory
competitive choice/ response suppression. Regression analyses suggest
better SERIAL ORDER and competitive choice/ response suppression
is associated with greater hippocampal volume.

J.H. KRAMER & G. COPPOLA. Pro- and Anti-Inflammatory SNPs
Predict Memory Performance in Mild Cognitive Impairment.
Objective: Accumulating evidence suggests that inflammatory processes
play a role in Alzheimer’s Disease (AD). Despite this established association, little is known about how inflammation-related genes relate to
memory function in the earliest stages of pathogenesis. We hypothesized that pro- and anti-inflammatory single nucleotide polymorphisms
(SNPs) would independently predict memory function in Mild Cognitive
Impairment.
Participants and Methods: DNA specimens for 55 amnestic MCI’s
and 24 normal controls were genotyped for pro-inflammatory IL-6
(rs1800795) and anti-inflammatory IL-10 (rs1800896) promoter
SNPs. Blood levels of IL-6 and IL-10 were also assayed. All participants
completed measures of list learning (CVLT-II short form; 10’ delay)
and visual memory (Benson Figure; 15’ delay), and a subset completed
a novel measure of pattern separation (Stark MST; Percent Correct).
Results: MCI participants showed greater likelihood of homozygosity
for the A allele of IL-10 SNP rs1800896, and showed lower levels of
peripheral IL-10 levels than healthy controls. Controlling for demographics and diagnosis, the C/C genotype of the IL-6 SNP was associated with better verbal memory recall (accounting for overall learning;
t=2.62, p=.01) and pattern separation (t=2.40, p=.02) than the G/G
genotype. The A/A genotype of the IL-10 SNP was associated with worse
verbal memory recall (t=-2.56, p=.01) and delayed visual recall (t=2.76, p=.008) relative to the G/G genotype. When SNPs were entered
into the model simultaneously, both contributed significantly to verbal
memory outcomes, and were more strongly related to delayed recall
than peripheral cytokine levels of IL-6 and IL-10.
Conclusions: Results suggest a potential role for pro-(IL-6) and anti-inflammatory (IL-10) SNPs in modulating episodic memory performance in MCI. These findings add to a growing body of literature on
inflammatory processes in neurodegenerative disease, and highlight the
need for further assessment of immunogenetic underpinnings of AD.

Integrity, Neurocognitive and Neurobehavioral Outcomes in
Long-term Survivors of Childhood Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia
(ALL).
Objective: To examine the association between white matter integrity,
as reflected through diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), and neurocognitive/
neurobehavioral outcomes in long-term survivors of ALL treated with
chemotherapy only.
Participants and Methods: Of 302 eligible ALL survivors treated on
a chemotherapy protocol that omitted cranial irradiation, 213 (70.5%)
(mean[SD] age = 14.6[4.7] years; time since diagnosis = 7.7[1.8] years)
completed comprehensive neurocognitive testing. Parents completed the
Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function. DTI was collected
in 174 of these survivors to assess white matter integrity. Fractional
anisotropy (FA), radial diffusivity (RD) and axial diffusivity (AX) were
extracted from voxels in frontal and parietal regions of interest, as well
as within the frontostriatal tract. Generalized linear models were used to
examine associations between DTI and neurocognitive/neurobehavioral
scores, adjusting for current age.
Results: Compared to population norms, survivors demonstrated lower
performance on measures of executive function, processing speed, attention and memory, and had more parent-reported neurobehavioral
problems (all p’s<0.01). Worse cognitive flexibility, fluency and visual-motor processing speed were associated with higher RD in bilateral
frontal (all p’s<0.05) and parietal (p’s<0.05) regions. Inattentiveness
was associated with lower FA in frontal regions (p’s<0.05) and higher
FA in the frontostriatal tract (left: p=0.007; right: p=0.04). Neurobehavioral problems were associated with lower FA in the frontostriatal
tract (working memory p=0.008; planning p=0.015) but not parietal
or other frontal regions. Memory and visual-spatial skills were not associated with DTI measures.
Conclusions: White matter integrity in frontal and parietal regions
is key to certain neurocognitive domains in long-term ALL survivors.
Neurobehavioral problems are particularly associated with reduced integrity in the frontostriatal tract.

Cognitive Performance Before and After Proton Therapy in
Children Recently Treated for Craniopharyngioma.
Objective: Craniopharyngioma is a benign tumor that often behaves
aggressively given location near critical brain structures and tendency to
cause neurologic and endocrine deficits. Consensus is lacking regarding
best treatment approach with some favoring radical surgery and others preferring limited surgery and radiation therapy. Proton therapy
(PT) may offer better cognitive outcomes than conventional radiation
therapy, given greater sparing of healthy brain tissue. In this study we
investigated cognitive performance before and after PT.
Participants and Methods: Patients treated for craniopharyngioma
[N= 78; 9.7±4.7 years at baseline; 48.7% Male; 1.4±1.0 pre-PT surgeries] participated in comprehensive cognitive assessments prior to PT
(baseline) and one year post PT (n=45), in an ongoing trial.
Results: At baseline, patients performed significantly worse than normative expectations (t-tests, ps<.05) on measures of memory (e.g.,
CVLT-C Total Trials), executive function (e.g., WISCIV Digit Span
Backward) and fine motor dexterity (Grooved Pegboard), with parents
reporting greater executive dysfunction (e.g., BRIEF Working Memory

224
Index), psychosocial distress (e.g., BASC-2 Internalizing) and lower
adaptive functioning (e.g., ABASII Practical). Linear mixed models revealed more surgeries, more extensive surgery and presence of diabetes
insipidus were predictive of worse baseline performance (ps<.05). Models also revealed significant declines in attention (WISCIV Digit Span
Forward; BASC-2 Attention Problems) over time with male gender,
more extensive pre-operative hypothalamic involvement, more extensive
surgery and CSF diversion predictive of decline (ps< .05).
Conclusions: Prior to adjuvant therapy children with craniopharyngioma experience cognitive difficulties, which are influenced by surgical method and endocrine status. Following PT there are declines
in attention related to patient, disease and treatment related factors.
These findings may guide treatment planning and indicate targets for
monitoring and intervention.

& K.R. KRULL. The Impact of Alcohol Consumption on
Neurocognitive Dysfunction in Adult Survivors of Childhood
Cancer.
Objective: To examine associations between drinking patterns and neurocognitive impairment in adult survivors of childhood cancer.
Participants and Methods: Participants included 3,806 adult survivors of childhood cancer (mean[SD] age at evaluation = 34.7[6.0] years,
time since diagnosis = 24.8[4.4] years) enrolled in the Childhood Cancer
Survivor Study (CCSS). Impairment was defined as scores falling >90th
percentile of sibling data on the CCSS Neurocognitive Questionnaire
(NCQ), which includes scales for task completion, emotional regulation,
organization, and memory. Exposures included age at drinking initiation (<18 vs. >18 years of age) and a pattern of heavy drinking (defined
as heavy/risky drinking at study baseline and at 13 year follow-up).
Risk ratios (RR) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI) were
calculated using log-binomial regression, with adjustment for current
age, age at diagnosis, sex, and race.
Results: In multivariable models stratified by cranial irradiation (CRT)
exposure, younger age at drinking initiation was associated with greater
risk of memory impairment (CRT: RR=1.3, 95% CI: 1.0-1.7; non-CRT:
RR=1.4, 95% CI: 1.1-1.8). Among survivors who did not receive CRT,
younger age at drinking initiation (RR=1.4, 95% CI: 1.1,-1.7) and
heavy drinking (RR=1.5, 95% CI: 1.0-2.2) were associated with increased risk of emotional dysregulation. In the non-CRT group, heavy
drinking also was associated with greater risk of impaired organization
(RR=1.2, 95% CI: 0.8-1.9) and memory (RR=1.3, 95% CI: 0.8-2.0).
Conclusions: Our results suggest that younger age at drinking initiation
is associated with increased risk of impaired memory beyond exposure
to CRT in childhood. A pattern of heavy drinking over time is associated
with impaired emotional regulation, organization and memory among
survivors who were not treated with CRT. Early intervention to modify drinking behaviors may reduce risk of neurocognitive impairment
among survivors.

Chronic Hepatitis C Infection among Adult Survivors of Childhood
Cancer: A Report from the St. Jude Lifetime Cohort.
Objective: To examine the association between chronic hepatitis C virus
(HCV) infection and neurocognitive function and health-related quality
of life (HRQOL) among adult survivors of childhood cancer.

Participants and Methods: Neurocognitive testing was conducted in
837 survivors of pediatric cancer (mean[SD] age = 35[7.4] years; time
since diagnosis = 29[6.2] years) who received blood products prior
to universal HCV screening. No significant differences were observed
between confirmed HCV seropositive (n=80) and seronegative survivors
(n=757) in sex, race, time since diagnosis, or neurotoxic treatment exposures. Survivors also completed a standardized measure of HRQOL.
Multivariable Poisson regression models were used to compare outcomes
between seropositive and seronegative survivors. Prevalence ratios (PR)
and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated.
Results: Seropositive survivors performed worse on measures of focused attention (P=0.001), long-term verbal memory (P=0.01), visual
motor processing speed (P= 0.006), cognitive flexibility (P= 0.001)
and verbal fluency (P=0.01), compared to seronegative survivors. In
multivariable models adjusted for sex, age at diagnosis, and cancer
treatment exposures, seropositive survivors were at increased risk of
impaired attention (RR=1.2; 95% CI: 0.9-1.6), memory (RR=1.3; 95%
CI: 0.9-1.7), processing speed (PR=1.3; 95% CI: 1.0-1.6), and executive
function (PR=1.3; 95% CI: 1.1-1.6). Seropositive survivors reported
worse general (PR=1.6; 95% CI: 1.2-2.1), physical (PR=1.5; 95% CI:
1.1-2.3), and mental HRQOL (PR=1.5; 95% CI: 1.1-2.1).
Conclusions: Survivors of childhood cancer with history of HCV infection are at risk for neurocognitive impairment and reduced HRQOL,
beyond the known risks associated with neurotoxic therapies. This HCV
seropositive population may benefit from targeted assessment of neurocognitive functioning and HRQL, and subsequent intervention. An
assessment of liver status may also help guide treatment.

Plenary F. The Development of Executive
Functions:
Principles and Strategies for Aiding that and
Differences by Genotype and Gender
Presenter: Adele Diamond

3:45–4:45 p.m.
A. DIAMOND. The Development of Executive Functions: Principles
and Strategies for Aiding that and Differences by Genotype and
Gender.
Among the most important abilities children can develop are the “executive functions” (EFs). EFs consist of 3 core skills: inhibitory control
(e.g., resisting one’s first impulse and giving a wiser, more considered
response; staying focused and persevering), working memory (e.g., mentally working with and relating facts and ideas), and cognitive flexibility
(e.g., thinking outside the box; looking at familiar problems in new
ways; flexibly adjusting to changed demands or priorities). These are
critical for reasoning, creative problem-solving, self-control, and success
in all life’s aspects. They are often more predictive than IQ or SES.
Executive functions depend on prefrontal cortex (PFC) and interrelated
brain regions. Unusual properties of PFC make it vulnerable to environmental and genetic variations that have little effect anywhere else in
the brain. This has implications for how best to treat different types of
ADHD, why the brightest people sometimes have the most fragile personalities especially when stressed, and why the Yerkes-Dodson curve
(that cognitive performance is better when one is a bit aroused rather
than calm) does not seem to apply to females.
EFs can be improved even in the very young by exercising and challenging them, much as physical exercise hones our bodies. I will walk
through some ways to aid EF development. A few widely-held beliefs
will be de-bunked: Aerobic exercise (by itself) does not improve EFs
(or memory). Transfer is not wide; people only improve on what they
practice. I will also present the data that have led me to predict that the

Forty Fourth Annual INS Meeting Abstracts
activities that most successfully improve EFs will be found to be those
that not only directly train and challenge diverse EF skills but also indirectly support EFs by addressing emotional, social, and physical needs.
Learning Objectives
Become better able to describe what executive functions are.
Become better able to use information about the special properties of
the dopamine system in prefrontal cortex in working with patients.
Become better able to explain principles and strategies for improving

Plenary G. Developing Neuropsychology in
Developing Countries:
An African Perspective
5:00–6:00 p.m.
A. WATTS. Developing Neuropsychology in Developing Countries:
An African Perspective.
More than 80% of the world’s population live in the less developed
countries (World Bank, 2014), where neurological, mental health,

225
developmental and substance use (NMDS) disorders are highly prevalent. This cluster of disorders represents a growing public health problem especially in these under resourced and less developed countries
where the treatment gap and contribution to the burden of disease is
disproportionately large. This underscores the need for neuropsychological research, education, training and services in these regions of the
world. However, the relevance of neuropsychology, with its Western
roots, in these countries is not immediately apparent to policy makers
who frequently do not understand the complex impacts of NMDS disorders on population health and economic growth. Instead their focus
is on preventing or containing the poverty and food insecurity which
are prioritized as primary threats to development.
This presentation will address critical priorities and challenges related
to establishing and growing neuropsychology within this context. In
doing so an African perspective will be used to illustrate evolving issues,
including relevance and elitism, the use of assessment and therapeutic
techniques within the context of multicultural diversity, and human
rights and policy imperatives.
Learning Objectives
As a result of participating in this course, the learner will be able:
To describe the specific public health problems that point to the need
for neuropsychological research, education and training services in developing countries.
To explain the challenges related to applying neuropsychological principles developed in the West to contexts of multicultural diversity.

J. VASTERLING. War and the Brain: Neuropsychological
Alterations among Returning Veterans.
Complaints of neurocognitive impairment have emerged after almost every major war-zone deployment in recent history. While contextualizing
recent war-zone participation within this historical context, this course
will focus on neurocognitive alterations among veterans of the wars in
Iraq and Afghanistan. Often referred to as the “signature wounds” of
contemporary military conflicts, the course will cover two primary risk
factors for neurocognitive alterations in returning veterans: traumatic
brain injury (TBI) and psychological stress. The course will review the
literature on neuropsychological consequences of deployment TBI, especially focusing on mild TBI, the neuropsychological consequences of
stress-related mental disorders, especially focusing on posttraumatic
stress disorder (PTSD), and potential interactions between deployment
TBI and PTSD.
Learning Objectives
As a result of participating in this course, the learner will:
Recognize relevant war-related neuropsychological risk factors, and
Have greater facility in applying existing empirical findings addressing
deployment-related TBI and PTSD to clinical practice.

E. RACINE. Introduction to Ethics in the Mind- And NeuroSciences (Neuroethics).
With advances in the behavioural and brain sciences, a new field of
ethics, “neuroethics”, has emerged as an interdisciplinary response to
important ethical dilemmas associated with research, health care delivery, and health policy. The field also attempts to capture insights from
neuroscience to inform how we view ethics. This workshop will introduce
to the history and development of neuroethics. Then, three examples of
clinical practices and related research areas where the speaker has been
active will be summarized and discussed with participants: (1) the use
of deep brain stimulation in Parkinson’s disease and in neuropsychiatric
conditions; (2) the use of fMRI in disorders of consciousness; and (3) the
ethical challenges associated with the use of cognitive enhancers. The
final part of the workshop will focus on how psychologists can further
contribute to the development of neuroethics.

9:00–10:30 a.m.
Cognitive Intervention/Rehabilitation
L.J. ALTMANN & J.P. WILSON. Effects of Depth of Semantic
Processing on Action Initiation.
Objective: Theories of embodied cognition assert that processing action words impacts speed of initiation and movement of the referenced
body part, which may benefit rehabilitation. We hypothesized that the
degree of semantic activation in different word processing tasks would
differentially impact reaching initiation.
Participants and Methods: Adults (N=34) aged 18-30 completed a
reaching task in baseline and 3 experimental conditions, which required
depressing a large button in front of them until a two-inch green dot
appeared on a touch-screen monitor, then touching the dot. Immediately after depressing the button, participants performed one of four
tasks, presented in blocks: nothing (baseline), or word reading, anagram
solving, or category generation, all of which required producing a word
aloud. Inter-stimulus intervals (ISI) between offset of voice response
and the green dot varied (250 or 500ms). Stimuli included arm-action
and non-action words. The dependent variable was the time from appearance of the green dot until button release (RT).
Results: Responses following word reading were fastest but insensitive to stimulus type. RTs following anagram solving of action words
slowed relative to non-action words and baseline. RTs following word
generation slowed regardless of stimulus type. After generating action
words, RTs were significantly slower than after generating non-action
words. Longer ISIs induced slower RTs following anagrams and category generation.
Conclusions: Unexpectedly, reading action words failed to facilitate
reaching relative to non-action words. These results suggest two conclusions: 1) the greater effort expended on the priming task, the greater
difficulty disengaging from that task to begin a second task, and 2)
producing words semantically related to the planned action appears to
exacerbate the difficulty with disengagement. Thus, using self-generated
semantic cues to movement may hinder rather than help movement
initiation.

Memory Skills Class Impact on Healthcare Utilization in Older
Veterans with PTSD.
Objective: Older Veterans with PTSD are at higher risk for dementia,
but early detection can be confounded by the fact that PTSD is often
associated with cognitive symptoms. Those at risk for decline may benefit from group psychoeducation that targets healthy brain aging. The
“Memory Skills for Older Adults with PTSD” protocol is an outpatient
psychoeducational class series developed at the VAPugetSound. This
study utilized chart review to measure patterns of healthcare utilization
in past participants.
Participants and Methods: Veterans: age>50, diagnosis of PTSD, subjective complaints and/or mild objective cognitive decline. Participants
engaged in 8 - 1hr sessions utilizing a skills manual developed for this
population. Retrospective chart review was performed to examine group
participation and utilization of health and support services.
Results: The Vietnam era Veterans (n=25) ranged in age from 57-75
years. Service connection was in place for 72%, with PTSD connection from 30-100%. 80% of subjects completed 4+ sessions. Cognitive
screenings had been done for 52% prior to the classes. Pre-existing
conditions/risk factors for dementia included HTN, DM, CAD, and
depression. Chart review reveals that they were actively engaged in

mental health services (96%) or under psychiatric care (84%) at time
of enrollment and continued these services after class completion. Of the
support and specialty services queried, mental health, psychiatry, neurology, physical therapy, and occupational therapy showed the greatest
number of new services utilized, ranging 8-16%.
Conclusions: Memory Skills group participation varies and is associated with pre/post group utilization of health and support services, particularly mental health specialties, but also proactive specialty services.
Future goals are to chart review additional group participants which
may reveal new associations between group characteristics, service utilization, and cognitive outcome.

C. ANDERSON-HANLEY, N. BARCELOS, M. MALONEY,
M. MICHEL, K. STRIEGNITZ & T. SAULNIER. Neuropsychological
Effects of Interactive Physical & Cognitive Exercise System
(iPACES) for Older Adults: Pilot Comparison of In-Home NeuroExergame Versus Neuro-Game.
Objective: Physical exercise has been found to be a powerful force in
brain health, with cognitive benefits seen in healthy as well as impaired
older adults, and can be seen with only a single bout (Angavaren et
al., 2008; Colcombe & Kramer, 2003; Hess et al., 2014). However,
only about 16% of older adults exercise at recommended levels (CDC,
2013). “Neuro-exergaming” combines physical exercise with interactive virtual reality features that may motivate exercise and yield added
cognitive benefit (Anderson-Hanley et al., 2012). Research is examining
the salient features of such interventions, so that more powerful tools,
perhaps tailored to specific cognitive problems, can be designed. This
study evaluated the neuropsychological benefits of a workout with a
theoretically-derived neuro-exergame compared with playing a sedentary neuro-game.
Participants and Methods: Ten older adults (mean age = 61 yrs.) were
enrolled; eight completed two single bout sessions. First, participants
played a tablet-based neuro-game Memory Lane© (learn errand locations, travel 3D path, then retrace path). Two weeks later, they completed an aerobic single bout playing Memory Lane© via an interactive
Physical and Cognitive Exercise System (iPACES© 2013-2015 patent
pending), where an under-table elliptical controlled the neuro-exergame. Tests of executive function (Color Trails, Stroop & Digit Span)
were administered before and after each single bout.
Results: Pilot testing revealed it is feasible for older adults to use the
iPACES at home. Neuro-exergaming yielded significantly greater improvement in Stroop than the game only (p=.019).
Conclusions: Pilot findings suggest added benefit of interactive physical and cognitive exercise, beyond neuro-gaming alone. Further research
would be useful to confirm findings and explore factors that may be
salient in the design of neuro-exergames.

W. FUNG, W. MESCHINO & C. TILL. Efficacy of Working Memory
Training for Individuals with Early-Stage Huntington’s Disease:
A Pilot Study.
Objective: Cognitive dysfunction is considered to be the most debilitating component of Huntington’s Disease (HD), with prominent deficits in
working memory (WM). Difficulties can be observed early, with 40% of
patients showing mild cognitive impairment prior to meeting diagnostic
criteria for the disorder. There are currently no established treatments
for these symptoms.
We aimed to assess whether completion of a WM training program led
to improvements on standardized WM tasks that (1) resemble those

Forty Fourth Annual INS Meeting Abstracts
practiced (i.e. criterion measures), and (2) that involve WM but differ
from the trained task (i.e. near-transfer measures), in patients with HD.
Participants and Methods: Six patients with early stage HD and
cognitive dysfunction underwent a 25-day computerized adaptive WM
training program (Cogmed). A coach made weekly phone contact to
provide motivational and training support.
A cognitive battery was administered prior to and following the WM
program. Criterion measures included the Weschler Memory Scale
(WMS-III) tests of Digit Span and Spatial Span. Near-transfer measures included the WMS-IV test of Symbol Span and the Woodcock
Johnson-III test of Auditory WM.
Results: Four patients completed the program within the six-week
recommended timeframe (M=36.5±4.0 days). Each of these patients
had improved performance on the trained tasks (mean improvement
score=15.5±14.7). A Wilcoxon signed rank test demonstrated near-significant improvement in spatial span and auditory WM (both p values
=0.066), with the intervention accounting for 42% of the variance in
these scores. No improvements were observed in the other measures.
Conclusions: These pilot data provide support for the efficacy of the
Cogmed program in early-stage HD patients. Improvements were observed in a visuospatial WM task that resembled those practiced, and a
near-transfer effect was observed in an auditory WM task. A full-scale
intervention project is needed to understand the reliability of changes
in criterion and near-transfer measures.

O. BARTHELEMY, M. GROSSO, J. DEGUTIS & A. CRONINGOLOMB. The Effects of Sustained Attention Training on Cognitive
and Functional Outcomes in Parkinson’s Disease: A Pilot Study.
Objective: Non-motor deficits such as in visuospatial function, attention, and working memory are prevalent in Parkinson’s disease (PD) and
can significantly affect daily functioning. Cognitive training programs
have shown mixed success in PD, with benefits being largely restricted
to tasks very similar to training. In the current pilot study, to promote
greater generalization we trained persons with PD to improve at sustained attention, a process that underlies and modulates several other
cognitive processes such as learning and executive function.
Participants and Methods: Eight non-demented individuals with
mild-to-moderate idiopathic PD (6 men; mean age 63.6 years) were
assessed before and after 4 weeks of at-home tonic and phasic attention training (TAPAT) (5 days/week, 36 mins/day, 12 hours total).
Neuropsychological assessments included visuospatial processing (visual dependence), short-term memory (digit span and spatial span),
long-term memory/learning (RAVLT), and executive function (verbal
fluency, Stroop, Trails). Functional outcomes included walking tasks
and the index of disease severity, the Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating
Scale (UPDRS).
Results: All participants significantly improved on the training task.
Comparing pre- to post-training revealed significantly decreased visual
dependence, improved delayed recall on the RAVLT, increased spatial
span, and improvement on the UPDRS . There were no improvements
on executive functioning tasks or the walking tasks.
Conclusions: The results of this pilot study suggest that in PD, training
sustained attention can generalize to improvements in working memory, long-term memory/learning, and visuospatial function as well as
reducing disease severity. Future studies using a larger dose of training
and a matched active control group would be useful to further test the
effectiveness of this training program.

L.O. RAMIG & J.C. BOROD. The Effect of the Lee Silverman Voice
Treatment (LSVT) on Facial Mobility, Social Engagement, and
Emotional Experience in Parkinson’s Disease (PD).
Objective: PD is associated with emotional processing deficits, which
affect communication and social interactions. However, few treatments
address the social impact of these deficits. This study examined the
influence of LSVT (Ramig et al., 1995) on facial mobility (FM), social
engagement (SE), and emotional experience (EE) on individuals with
PD compared to Healthy Controls (HCs).
Participants and Methods: Participants were 39 individuals with PD
(69% male) and 14 demographically-matched HCs (62% male). PD
participants were randomly assigned to 3 groups: 12 received voice
treatment (LSVT), 14 received speech articulation treatment (Spielman et al., 2012), and 13 received no treatment. Participants produced emotional (happy, sad, angry) and neutral monologues using
procedures from the New York Emotion Battery (Borod, Welkowitz,
& Obler, 1992), which were videotaped and evaluated by 18 trained
raters (50% male) for FM (amount of muscle movement) and SE (how
much the rater wanted to interact with the poser/participant). After
each emotion monologue, participants indicated the overall intensity of
their emotional experience during the monologue (EE-O), the intensity
of their emotional feelings right after the monologue (EE-I), and the
accuracy with which they produced the monologue (EE-A).
Results: A Group (4) x Gender (2) x Time (2) x Monologue Type
(3 or 4) ANOVA was performed for each variable. The LSVT group
significantly (p<.05) improved on FM, EE-O, and EE-I from pre- to
post-treatment; the 3 other groups did not. For EE-A, male PDs improved (p<.10) after LSVT for the Anger monologue. Gender differences
were also found; women, relative to men, displayed higher (p<.05) FM
and EE-I overall and a trend toward higher SE for the Anger monologue
at Time 1.
Conclusions: Findings suggest that LSVT may be a useful treatment
to increase facial movement and the ability to experience feelings in
individuals with PD. Clinically, enhanced emotional experience may
be useful in improving mood disorders that often co-occur with PD.

T.K. CHOUDHURY, K. CRIST, C.G. HARRIS, T.K. SATTERWHITE,
B. TREECE & M.K. YORK. Comparative Patient Satisfaction and
Efficacy of a Parkinson’s Disease Enrichment Program (PEP).
Objective: To evaluate the patient satisfaction and efficacy of a Parkinson’s Disease Enrichment Program (PEP) for improving cognitive and
psychiatric symptoms and quality of life in Parkinson’s disease (PD)
Participants and Methods: Twenty independently functioning
non-demented PD patients participated in a five-week PEP, which is a
broad-spectrum social enrichment group. Each four-hour weekly session included content which addressed education, exercise, recreation
and socialization/support. PD participants received a pre-assessment,
including cognitive tests and questionnaires for depression, anxiety and
quality of life (QOL). After the completion of the program, participants
completed post-assessment batteries to measure changes in neurocognitive and psychiatric status, as well as patient satisfaction regarding
the program.
Results: The mean age of participants was 68.9 years, with a mean
education level of 16.6 years and a mean time since diagnosis of 6.3
years. Following the PEP program, significant improvements were observed for semantic category switching and accuracy, as well as delayed
recall of a word list. No significant cognitive declines were noted. After
5 weeks, participants reported a significant reduction in symptoms of
depression and in distress caused by their PD symptoms. 100% of participants reported overall high satisfaction with the program.
Conclusions: Positive participant feedback and short-term cognitive
and mood improvements suggest that further expansion of this program

228
for treatment of NMS may be beneficial in improving cognitive and
psychiatric status in PD patients. Follow-up data will be collected after 6 months to measure for longer-term improvements in cognition
and emotional status. Additional PEPs will continue to be evaluated to
augment sample size and strengthen internal validity. Future studies
will compare the efficacy of PEPs to a best medical therapy group and
a cognitive rehabilitation intervention for PD.

A. BUDSON & M.K. O’CONNOR. Using a Mindfulness Approach to
Reduce the Imagination Inflation Effect in Older Adults.
Objective: The imagination inflation effect is a type of memory distortion resulting in an increased tendency to falsely remember that a
previously imagined action has been performed. Previous research has
shown that the imagination inflation effect can have substantial implications for daily functioning. An intervention based on mindfulness
principles was hypothesized to decrease the imagination inflation effect
in healthy older adults.
Participants and Methods: Healthy older adults (n=12; mean age=78)
participated. In the first session, participants were read an action statement such as “turn off the stove” and engaged in one of three activities:
listened to the statement being read, performed the action, or imagined
performing the action. During session two (immediately following session one), participants imagined action statements from the first session,
as well as completely new action statements. In session three (24 hours
later), participants were asked to determine whether action statements
were or were not performed during the first session. Intervention participants (n=6) were instructed before the first and third sessions to attend
to various aspects of their sensory experience.
Results: Following intervention, participants had better recognition
(hits minus false alarms) of performed actions after three imaginings
(Control M = 0.63, SD = 0.13; Intervention M = 0.90, SD = 0.02; t(5)
= -2.12, p <0.05).
Conclusions: Older adults were helped by an intervention based on
mindfulness principles intended to decrease the imagination inflation
effect. These data and methods can be used to tailor cognitive rehabilitation strategies and to improve memory for actual events.

R.T. DALEY, E.L. CLARK, R. BERMAN, E. KWON &
M.K. O’CONNOR. Age Well through Interaction and Scientific
Education (AgeWISE): A Cognitive Intervention for Older Veterans.
Objective: Concerns regarding dementia have increased with the number of aging adults. Yet, the public’s knowledge of dementia remains
limited and older adults often misinterpret normal aging as pathologic.
This pilot study sought to explore the impact of AgeWISE (Age Well
through Interaction and Scientific Education), a 12-week psychoeducational and skills training intervention. We hypothesized AgeWISE
would: 1) enhance knowledge of memory and aging; 2) increase perceived self-efficacy related to memory; and 3) help to maintain cognition
in cognitively healthy older Veterans (VT).
Participants and Methods: In this randomized controlled trial VTs,
aged 64-87, completed a medical history and global cognitive function
screen (Mini-Mental State Exam) to determine eligibility. Eligible VTs
completed baseline neuropsychological testing (NPT) and questionnaires and were randomized to intervention (IV = 10) or control (OC
= 10) groups. IVs participated in AgeWISE and OCs were instructed
to continue “life as usual.” All VTs completed NPT and questionnaires
again at 12 weeks.
Results: Results revealed higher scores on the Knowledge of Memory
Aging Questionnaire post-intervention for IVs (M = 21.4, SD = 3.27)
compared to OCs (M = 18.80, SD = 2.20), [F (1,18) = 5.20, p = 0.04].

This improvement was significant [F (1,18) = 4.35, p = 0.05]. IVs (M
= 44.1, SD = 9.39) also scored higher on the Multifactorial Memory
Questionnaire Ability subscale, a measure of perceived memory ability,
compared to OCs (M = 32.40, SD = 12.20), [F (1,18) = 10.10, p =
0.005]. This improvement was significant, [F (1,18) = 5.77, p = 0.03].
NPT did not significantly improve for either group post-intervention,
although numerically IVs showed improvement on some measures.
Conclusions: AgeWISE improved perception of memory ability and
is a means of providing education about brain health and improving
psychological, and possibly, cognitive health.

S. JONES, J. GREEN, E. SKENE & G. ESKES. Does Working
Memory Training Work? A Pilot Study in Parkinson’s Disease.
Objective: Cognitive impairment is common in Parkinson’s Disease
(PD), including deficits in attention and working memory (WM). No
specific treatment is routinely offered to PD patients to improve cognition. We examined if WM training could benefit attention and WM,
and generalize to daily function in individuals with PD compared to
healthy controls.
Participants and Methods: Fifteen participants with idiopathic PD
(Hoehn & Yahr Stage 1, 2) on stable medications, and 15 healthy older
adults participated (matched on age, education, premorbid IQ). All
participants were randomly assigned to either WM training (adaptive
dual n-back) or control training (non-adaptive computer activity) for 5
times per week (30 minutes/day) for 5 weeks. All participants completed
a standardized neuropsychological battery and a computerized battery
of attention tasks at baseline (simple and choice reaction time (RT),
go-no-go, flanker, Sternberg item and location WM, visual search).
Outcome tests included the computerized attention tasks, Dysexecutive
Questionnaire, Cognitive Failures Questionnaire (CFQ) and Raven’s
Progressive Matrices.
Results: At baseline, PD participants showed lower performance than
the control group on tests of attention, memory and executive function
(Trail Making test, Hopkins Verbal Learning Test, phonemic fluency)
as well as problems with initiation, interference, and WM on the computerized tasks. After WM training, the PD group showed significant
improvement on computerized tasks of initiation (simple and choice
RT, simple discrimination search task), and verbal WM compared to
the control group. WM training also resulted in better performance on
a test of executive control (flanker task) and self-reports of everyday
action slips (CFQ) in both PD and control groups.
Conclusions: These pilot results suggest that WM training has both
specific and generalizable effects that are not confined to persons with
PD. Further investigation of these effects is ongoing.

W.P. MILBERG & R. MCGLINCHEY. Preliminary Effectiveness
of the STEP-Home Workshop in Facilitating Post-Deployment
Reintegration among OEF/OIF/OND Veterans.
Objective: Veterans of Operation Enduring Freedom, Operation Iraqi
Freedom, and Operation New Dawn (OEF/OIF/OND) face many challenges as they re-enter civilian life, given their unparalleled rates of
comorbid physical and psychological conditions. Difficulties with civilian reintegration are present regardless of exact clinical diagnosis.
The current study evaluates the preliminary effectiveness of a newly
developed reintegration workshop, STEP-Home, designed to aid all
OEF/OIF/OND Veterans in their transition from military to civilian life.
Participants and Methods: The 12-session workshop is adapted
from the evidence-based rehabilitation program, “STEP,” which has

Forty Fourth Annual INS Meeting Abstracts
demonstrated efficacy in ameliorating cognitive and emotional deficits
following mTBI in civilians (Short-Term Executive Plus, STEP; Cantor
et al., 2014). STEP-Home targets the unique needs of post-deployment Veterans by focusing content of the civilian STEP program on
commonly faced reintegration issues. Six groups (n=47) of OEF/OIF/
OND Veterans participated in the study. Evaluation of preliminary
effectiveness was assessed via self-report scales administered pre and
post-workshop including: Quality of Life Scale (QOLS), World Health
Organization Disability (WHODAS-2), Military to Civilian (M2C), Connected to VA Services, Impulsive Aggression Scale (IAS), and attention
scale (ARCES).
Results: Preliminary data show modest improvements in
QOLS (pre=56.7;SD=13.5;post=58.2;SD=17.5), WHODAS-2 (pre=51.7;SD=22.4;post=48.1;SD=20.0), M2C
(pre=32.2;SD=13.0;post=26.9;SD=12.6), IAS (pre=38.5;SD=28.0;post=34.1;SD=27.6), and ARCES (pre=40.7;SD=9.2;post=38.0;SD=8.3). Veterans reported significant increases in feeling connected to the VA (p<.01;pre=27.2;SD=5.6;post=33.9;SD=3.1).
A group member reported, “This is keeping me busy, it’s the highlight
of my week. I like coming here.”
Conclusions: STEP-Home demonstrates potential to improve reintegration into civilian life for an often difficult to engage cohort of
Veterans.

S. GUIMOND & M. LEPAGE. Increase in Prefrontal Activity
Following a Brief Memory Training in Schizophrenia Patients.
Objective: Episodic memory (EM) is one of the most affected cognitive
domains in schizophrenia and strongly relates to community functioning
and outcome. Self-initiation of semantic encoding strategies (SISES) is
impaired in this population and may partially explain their EM difficulties. We recently developed and tested a brief cognitive training that
significantly improved the SISES in a group of people with schizophrenia. The aim of the current study was to determine whether this training
could improve neural activity in brain areas known to be involved in
SISES, notably the prefrontal cortex.
Participants and Methods: Thirty individuals with enduring schizophrenia performed the Semantic Encoding Memory Task (SEMT) at
baseline while brain activity was assessed with an fMRI scan. The SEMT
is devised to isolate the SISES in one specific condition. A significant
deficit within this condition was observed in 12 patients, which were
consequently included in our training group. The training consisted of
two 60-minute sessions including a short meta-memory presentation,
semantic encoding strategy memory exercises, and a bridging period.
After completion of training, patients memorized new items in the SEMT
task once again, while undergoing fMRI. To observe brain activity differences pre-post training, we performed a paired t-test between the
contrasts that isolate the SISES.
Results: Memory training led to a significant increase in brain activity
in the left prefrontal cortex in the condition where patients needed to
self-initiate semantic encoding strategies (p < 0.001). Patients also significantly improved their EM performance in this condition (p < 0.005).
Conclusions: In the current study, EM improvements were associated
with increased brain activity in regions responsible for SISES in healthy
controls. These results suggest that a brief intervention targeting this
deficient memory process can positively impact performance and brain
activity.

M.R. HAMBLIN & M.A. NAESER. Increased Functional
Connectivity in Default Mode Network Associated with Application
of Transcranial, Light-Emitting Diodes to Treat Chronic Aphasia:
Case Series.
Objective: This study examined effects of scalp application of red
and near-infrared (NIR) light-emitting diodes (LEDs) on naming in
chronic aphasia patients and on resting-state functional-connectivity
(rs-fcMRI). Red and NIR wavelengths of light improve mitochondrial
function in hypoxic/compromised cells by increasing adenosine tri-phosphate (ATP) and improving cell function; there is focal increase in rCBF.
Participants and Methods: Four right-handed persons with aphasia
participated at 2-13Y post- left hemisphere (LH) stroke (4M, 46-69Y).
Each was tested 3x at Entry/Baseline. Change of +2SD from Baseline
on a primary outcome measure - picture naming (Boston Naming Test,
Philadelphia Naming Test) or verbal fluency (FAS, Animals) was considered significant for a case (95% Confidence Interval, p=.05). LED
therapy is non-invasive, painless, non-thermal (<500mW). The 2-inch
diameter, LED cluster heads are FDA-cleared as non-significant risk
(MedX Health). A total of 18 LED treatments were applied (MWF, 6
Wks). The rs-fcMRI scans (3T Philips, Achieva) obtained pre-/postLED series were analyzed with REST toolkit (Song et al., 2011).
Results: Two cases had Mod./Poor Response (MR/PR), +2SD on 2/6
naming tests and -2SD on 1; or no change. They received LEDs on
LH and 1 node on Default Mode Network (DMN), midline, bilateral
mesial prefrontal cortex (mPFC); 13J/cm2/LED. Two cases had Good
Response (GR), +2SD on 2-4/6 naming tests and -2SD on 0. They
received LEDs on LH and 2 nodes on DMN (mPFC, precuneus); 26J/
cm2/LED. Correlations were converted to z-scores. Paired t-tests on
these data showed MR/PR cases had no significant changes on rs-fcMRI
post-LED. GR cases had significant increases post-LED within DMN,
p<.0005; Salience, p<.0005; Central Executive, p<.05, networks.
Conclusions: Results suggest transcranial LED may be useful to treat
aphasia and other CNS disorders.

A.W. HUNT, M. PANICCIA, N. REED, D.R. DAWSON &
M. KEIGHTLEY. A Top-Down Approach to Management of Youth
with Prolonged Recovery Following Concussion.
Objective: The purpose of this study was to determine the feasibility
of a top-down self-management intervention featuring metacognitive
strategy training on return to activity for youth with persistently elevated
post-concussion symptoms. Specific objectives were to determine effects
on: 1) activity performance; 2) symptom reduction; and 3) mood of both
youth and their parents.
Participants and Methods: A pre-post single case design was used
with two youth athletes with persistent post-concussion symptoms and
their mothers. Both youth also reported problems with participation in
usual activities (e.g. school, sport). Measures of activity performance
(COPM, PAQ), symptoms (PCSI), and mood (Beck) (both youth and
parent) were collected. The intervention (CO-OP Approach) entailed
10, 30-minute, in-home sessions that focused on teaching participants to
use a metacognitive problem solving strategy (Goal-Plan-Do-Check) to
work toward self-identified activity based goals. Qualitative interviews
were conducted post-intervention to understand participants’ experiences and perceptions about key features of the intervention.
Results: Clinically significant, positive changes were found on participants’ performance of all activity-based goals. Improvements were seen
on measures of physical activity participation, symptoms, mood and
anxiety (youth and parent). Qualitatively, youth participants indicated
that the intervention ‘taught’ them ‘how to get back to doing things’.
Parents reported it helped their child ‘regain confidence’.
Conclusions: A top-down approach to rehabilitation for youth with
prolonged elevation in symptoms following concussion is feasible and

230
may contribute positively to activity resumption, symptom resolution
and mood. More rigorous study is warranted.

A. JAYWANT, T.D. ELLIS, S. ROY, C. LIN, S. NEARGARDER &
A. CRONIN-GOLOMB. From Seeing to Moving: A Translational
Intervention to Enhance Walking in Parkinson’s Disease.
Objective: Parkinson’s disease (PD) causes impairments in walking that
persist despite pharmacological treatment. Perceptual training using
the repeated observation of human motion and actions (i.e., biological
motion) has been used successfully to improve upper limb function and
freezing of gait in PD, but it is unknown if it can also improve spatiotemporal aspects of walking. We examined the efficacy and feasibility
of a home-based perceptual training (gait observation) intervention for
enhancing walking in PD.
Participants and Methods: Non-demented individuals with PD experiencing walking difficulty were randomized to Gait Observation (N=13;
intervention condition; viewing videos of healthy and parkinsonian gait)
or Landscape Observation (N=10; control condition; viewing videos of
moving water) and engaged in perceptual training daily for eight days.
Walking was assessed using accelerometers in the laboratory (baseline
and post-training assessments) and continuously at home during the
training period. Self-report questionnaires of mobility and quality of
life, including the 39-item Parkinson’s Disease Questionnaire, were
administered.
Results: ANOVA and linear mixed-effects models were conducted to
determine change in walking. At post-training assessment, only the Gait
Observation group reported significantly improved mobility (p < .05,
Cohen’s d = .25). No improvements were seen in objective (accelerometer-derived) walking data, including daily activity, walking speed, stride
length, stride frequency, leg swing time, or gait asymmetry. Participants
found the at-home computer task and accelerometer feasible to use.
Conclusions: Gait observation holds promise as a means of enhancing
walking in PD. Training with a more challenging and adaptive task,
and the use of explicit perceptual learning and practice of observed
actions, may be required to effect significant objective improvements.

W.D. KILLGORE & M. WEBER. Blue Wavelength Light Therapy
Reduces Daytime Sleepiness following Mild Traumatic Brain
Injury.
Objective: Some of the most common symptoms of mild traumatic brain
injury (mTBI) include excessive daytime sleepiness and fatigue, with
approximately 50% of affected individuals reporting such problems.
Some evidence suggests that morning blue wavelength light therapy may
provide an effective treatment for fatigue problems in mTBI patients.
Here we tested a six-week program of blue wavelength light therapy for
its effectiveness at reducing daytime sleepiness in individuals with mTBI.
Participants and Methods: Thirty individuals (15 female; aged 18-45
years) with a history of mTBI during the preceding 18 months completed
the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) and several other questionnaires at
baseline and again after 6 consecutive weeks of treatment. Participants
were randomly assigned to use either a blue-wavelength (active; n=15)
or amber-wavelength (placebo; n=15) light device at home for 6 weeks
(30-minutes each morning).
Results: Repeated measures ANOVA, controlling for the number of days
of light used, baseline sleep disturbance, and total sleep obtained on the
baseline night, showed a significant reduction in ESS scores for the blue
light group but not the amber light group (p=.04). Furthermore, 86% of
those receiving blue light showed a decline in sleepiness scores whereas
only 40% of those receiving amber light showed a decline (p=.008).

Conclusions: Six weeks of daily morning treatment with blue wavelength light therapy was associated with a significant improvement in
daytime sleepiness compared to placebo among individuals with mTBI.
Because morning exposure to blue light has been shown to suppress
melatonin and phase advance the circadian rhythm, it is likely that the
observed effects are due to improvement in sleep and daytime alertness due to entrainment of the circadian system. Blue wavelength light
therapy may be an effective means for reducing sleepiness in patients
with mTBI.

W.D. KILLGORE, M. WEBER & D. PENETAR. Blue Wavelength
Light Therapy Improves Balance following Mild Traumatic Brain
Injury.
Objective: Mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) is associated with a
number of cognitive and psychomotor symptoms, including persistent
difficulties with balance and stance stability. Additionally, mTBI has
been associated with sleep problems and fatigue in up to 50% of patients. Blue wavelength light therapy has previously been shown to improve fatigue in mTBI patients. We hypothesized that improvement
of sleep via circadian re-entrainment with blue light exposure therapy
would enhance brain repair and therefore be associated with improvement in balance problems following mTBI.
Participants and Methods: Twenty-eight individuals (15 female; aged
18-48 years) with a history of mTBI during the preceding 18 months underwent balance and stance-stability (BSS) testing while standing erect
on a platform with feet together, eyes open, with arms extended, palms
up. In a double-blind design, participants were randomly assigned to use
either a blue-wavelength (active; n=14) or amber-wavelength (placebo;
n=14) light device. Participants then underwent 6 weeks of at-home
light exposure therapy (30-minutes daily, prior to 11:00am). Following
treatment, participants again returned to the lab to undergo the BSS test.
Results: Compared to baseline, the active blue light group decreased
body sway movement by 9.89% while the amber placebo light placebo
group increased by 23.98%, F(1,25) = 4.31, p = .048. Furthermore, the
change in stance stability was found to be significantly correlated with
the change in subjective sleepiness from baseline to post-treatment, but
only for the active light group (r = .58, p = .03), but not for the placebo
light condition (r = -.31, p = .31).
Conclusions: Six weeks of daily morning exposure to BLUE light
was associated with an improvement in stance stability compared to
a matched placebo and this improvement corresponded directly to the
reduction in daytime sleepiness. Blue light therapy may be an effective
treatment for balance problems following mTBI.

S.A. LANGENECKER, N. DAVIDSON & C. IRMITER. Degree of
engagement in cognitive remediation predicts improvement in
family support and cognitive skills in adults with Autism Spectrum
Disorder.
Objective: One area of increasing interest in cognitive enhancement and
remediation is in autistic spectrum disorder (ASD). The present study
is an open label, single intervention using Posit Science for computer
remediation for this population..
Participants and Methods: Thirty-five individuals were recruited,
with a primary diagnosis of autism (n = 17), Asperger (n =12), and
Pervasive Developmental Disorder, NOS (n = 6) for an open labeled,
single trial study. over the course of eight weeks. Inclusion criteria were
also Ritvo Autism and Asperger Diagnostic Scale-Revised (RAADS-R
score greater than 14, and WRAT Reading standard score greater than
68. Six Posit modules (attention, memory, brain speed, people skills,
navigation, and intelligence) were available to participants. Far transfer

Forty Fourth Annual INS Meeting Abstracts
measurements included the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scale (parent/caregiver report), and the Scales of Independent Behavior-Revised.
Other aspects of functioning were captured with the Multidimensional
Scale of Perceived Social Support and Cognitive Self-Report.
Results: Individuals completed on average, 257 levels of training across
all six areas. Degree of engagement (number of levels completed, in
total), was predictive of improvement in attention, brain speed, people
skills, and navigation. There was an interaction between the number of
levels completed and improvement in the RAADS (p = .01), predicted
primarily by number of levels completed in brain speed (B = -.18, p =
.30) and navigation (B = -.65, p = .001). Number of levels completed
predicted a significant increase in perceived family support (p = .02)
and improvement in cognitive skills (p = .02).
Conclusions: Cognitive remediation may be an effective way to
strengthen skills in computer tasks. Far transfer to functioning in activities, by self and other’s report, were not present; whereas level of
engagement (levels completed) did predict improvement in self-report
cognitive functioning and family support.

S.L. MARTINDALE, S.B. MORISSETTE & S.L. DOLAN. Sleep
Quality as a Mediator Between Combat Experiences and
Neuropsychological Outcomes in Iraq/Afghanistan Veterans.
Objective: Veterans returning from combat frequently report sleep difficulties and poor sleep quality, the root cause of which may range from
sleep apnea or pain to anxiety or nightmares. Sleep problems are often
associated with cognitive difficulties that can manifest behaviorally,
causing difficulties with daily life. By evaluating sleep as a modifiable
mediator for combat veterans with cognitive difficulties, we can determine if sleep may be a viable primary target in treatment to attempt to
improve specific presenting cognitive issues.
Participants and Methods: Participants were 129 male veterans, ages
22-55, deployed to the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan after 2001. Participants completed the DRRI-2 Combat Experiences Scale, Pittsburgh
Sleep Quality Index, and a neuropsychological assessment battery including the CVLT-II, WAIS-IV Digit Span Forward and Backward,
Wisconsin Card Sorting Task – 64, D-KEFS Color Word Interference,
Tower Test, Trails, and Verbal Fluency.
Results: Analyses indicated that combat experiences influenced cognitive flexibility, measured with the D-KEFS Color-Word Interference
inhibition/switching condition, through its effects on sleep quality.
Combat experiences was negatively associated with sleep quality, a; β
= -.06, p < .01, which was, in turn, negatively associated with cognitive
flexibility, b; β = .17, p < .01. Additionally, an indirect relationship was
seen between combat experiences and processing speed, measured with
the D-KEFS Color-Word Interference combined naming and reading
composite score, such that greater sleep problems were associated with
slowed processing speed, b; β = .15, p = .01.
Conclusions: Cognitive flexibility and processing speed were sensitive
to poor sleep quality in veterans with greater combat experiences. Veterans presenting with slowed processing speed and cognitive inflexibility
may benefit from sleep evaluations to determine if addressing sleep
issues in early treatment is appropriate.

Acceptability of a Computerized Cognitive Training Program in
Survivors of Pediatric Brain Tumor.
Objective: Pediatric brain tumor survivors (PBTS) are at risk for longterm attention and working memory deficits following tumor-directed
treatments. These difficulties are increasingly being addressed with

231
home-based cognitive training programs such as CogmedRM, though
research establishing the feasibility of these interventions is limited. The
present study used qualitative methods to evaluate the feasibility and
acceptability of CogmedRM in PBTS and their caregivers.
Participants and Methods: Potentially eligible participants (N=108),
greater than two years from the conclusion of tumor-directed treatments, were identified through a tumor registry at a large mid-Atlantic
Children’s Hospital. Fifty-four were unable to be contacted and 19 declined participation; 15 had no identified working memory deficits, resulting in a final sample of 20 PBTS, ages 7-15 years (M=10.8, SD=2.6).
PBTS were scheduled to complete 25 1-hour CogmedRM sessions over
35-42 days, accompanied by weekly coaching calls.
Results: Ten participants (50%) completed all 25 sessions over 3179 days (M=49.0, SD=14.4). Of the 10 non-completers, 3 failed to
start training after enrollment. Non-completers attempted 0-19 sessions
(M=7.2, SD=7.6) over 43.1 days (SD=29.6) before withdrawing. Completers (M=94.3, SD=16.3) and non-completers (M=90.4, SD=15.6)
did not differ in terms of baseline IQ. Parents of completers were more
likely to be married (90% v. 60%) and employed (80% v. 40%). Despite
reporting PBTS boredom (70%) and frustration (100%) during training, parents of completers were satisfied with the intervention (100%)
and indicated that overall PBTS enjoyed sessions (80%). Parents of
non-completers cited time commitment and survivor noncompliance
as reasons for withdrawing.
Conclusions: CogmedRM may be a feasible and acceptable intervention for PBTS with access to greater family resources. It is important to
screen families in need of additional supports prior to beginning in-home
sessions in order identify and address potential barriers to adherence.

Improving Inhibition: The Effectiveness of Implementation
Intentions and Visual Imagery may be Limited by Cue Specificity.
Objective: Self-regulation of one’s behavior is an integral part of managing common everyday tasks. An important form of self-regulation is
the inhibition of goal-irrelevant responses. Recent studies demonstrated
that inhibition can be facilitated by implementation intentions (if-then
statements) in children with ADHD (Gawrilow & Gollwitzer, 2008;
Gawrilow, Gollwitzer, & Oettingen, 2011). In an unpublished study of
undergraduate students (McFarland, Grilli, & Glisky, 2014), we found
that implementation intentions did not improve inhibition; however,
visual imagery did. The aim of the present study was to examine the
effectiveness of implementation intentions and visual imagery when a
less specific cue for response inhibition was used.
Participants and Methods: Forty-two undergraduates were randomly
assigned to one of three instructional groups (standard, implementation
intention, imagery) after which they completed a lexical decision task.
Participants were told to withhold a response any time they encountered
a word belonging to the category ‘animal’.
Results: One-way ANOVAs revealed no group differences in inhibition,
F(2,39) = .80, p = .46, lexical decision accuracy, F(2,39) = .64. p =
.53 or reaction time, F(2,39) = 1.09, p = .35. Participants who received
implementation intentions or imagery instructions were no more likely
to successfully inhibit inappropriate responses than participants who
received standard instructions.
Conclusions: These results suggest that the effectiveness of implementation intentions and visual imagery in facilitating inhibition may be
limited to very specific cues. Although neither strategy was effective in
the current study, methodological factors may have played a role. Future
research will examine the generalizability of these strategies using other
paradigms. The current findings raise important questions about the
clinical utility, and potential limitations, of these strategies.

Training in Veterans with PTSD and mTBI.
Objective: Difficulties in executive control functions, including selection,
maintenance, and execution of goal-relevant information and activities
are common sequelae of both TBI and PTSD. Goal-Oriented Attentional
Self-Regulation (GOALS) training was designed to target these deficits
with attention regulation training applied to participant-defined goals.
In previous studies both Veteran and civilian participants with chronic
TBI significantly improved post GOALS, but not control training, on
measures of attention/executive function, functional task performance,
and self-report measures of emotional regulation (Novakovic-Agopian
et al 2011, Novakovic-Agopian et al 2015), and on goal-directed control
over neural processing on fMRI (Chen, et al 2011). The objective of this
ongoing study is to assess effectiveness of GOALS training in Veterans
with comorbid PTSD and mTBI.
Participants and Methods: Twelve Veterans (ages 29-68) with diagnosis of PTSD, history of chronic mTBI and mild-moderate executive
dysfunction were randomized to start with either 5 week GOALS or
control Brain-Health (EDU) training. Participants that started with
EDU switched to GOALS during second 5 weeks. Assessments at baseline, weeks 5, 10 and 6 months included neuropsychological, functional
task performance and self-report measures
Results: Post GOALS training, but not post EDU, participants significantly improved on neuropsychological measures of attention/executive
function, complex functional task performance and measures of emotional regulation. Participants reported incorporating trained strategies
into their daily life..
Conclusions: GOALS training may be promising in Veterans with concurrent PTSD and chronic mTBI. Improving cognitive control functioning may also improve functioning in other domains such as functional
complex task performance and emotional regulation. The challenges
and importance of: a) assessing change in functioning at different levels,
and b) using participant-defined goals applied to relevant training, will
be discussed.

Effectiveness of a Comprehensive Cognitive Rehabilitation
Protocol with a Neurologically-Compromised Adolescent.
Objective: Cognitive rehabilitation is an important intervention for remediation of higher-level skills, both following acute neurological injury
and as a long-term maintenance intervention. This case study highlights
the effects of a comprehensive cognitive rehabilitation protocol with a
16 year-old female with a history of cerebral palsy, epilepsy, autism,
learning disorder, and ADHD.
Participants and Methods: Cognitive rehabilitation interventions were
primarily targeted at improving executive functioning (e.g., working
memory). Social skills training and medication management services
were later included at the request of the parents. Data from a comprehensive neuropsychological evaluation were used as a baseline for
development of a treatment protocol. The CNS Vital Signs (CNS-VS),
a valid, reliable screening of neurocognitive functioning, was used
throughout the course of treatment to track progress. The patient’s
ongoing treatment plan has consisted of approximately 70 cognitive
rehabilitation and social skills training visits over a period of 13 months,
and medication management services, provided by a clinical, medical,
and neuropsychologist.
Results: The CNS-VS was administered after five months of treatment,
which included approximately 20 sessions, and again nearly five months

later, after additional cognitive rehabilitation and introduction of social
skills training. Improvements were observed in verbal and visual memory, processing speed, executive functions, complex attention, and cognitive flexibility. Moreover, the family reported qualitative, functional
improvements in behavior and adaptive functioning.
Conclusions: This case study describes the effectiveness of a comprehensive treatment protocol that included cognitive rehabilitation, social
skills training, and medication management in a neurologically-compromised adolescent. Qualitative and quantitative improvements were
observed and reported in several cognitive domains, including executive
functioning, memory, attention, and adaptive skills.

& C. CELLARD. A study of Feasibility and Acceptability using
a Computerized Cognitive Remediation program with youth
suffering from Psychiatric disorders with Maltreatment.
Objective: Cognitive remediation is a behavioral treatment to facilitate improvement in cognitive and social functioning among different
psychiatric populations. No study has evaluated the feasibility and
acceptability of cognitive remediation with teenagers with psychiatric
disorders in a context of youth protection intervention.The aims of this
study were to assess the feasibility of CIRCuiTS teenagers’version, a
cognitive remediation program, for at-risk youth and to investigate the
acceptability of the program by teenagers and their social interveners
Participants and Methods: Qualitative questionnaires which assess
the attractiveness, ease of understanding and use and culturally acceptability of specific aspects of the program were completed by clients and
therapists. Therapeutic alliance was also evaluated. Nine teenagers with
a psychiatric disorder who suffered from maltreatment during childhood
or adolescence and their social interveners participated to the evaluation
of the therapy. The main issues arising from this feasibility study were
also collected (sessions missed, length of sessions, dropout).
Results: Qualitative analysis of rating of CIRCuiTS showed a positive
evaluation of the attractiveness, ease of understanding and use and
culturally by clinical and therapist participants. The relationship between therapist and client was positive which promoted trust and mutual
aid. Despite the good evaluation of the program, many teenagers have
abandoned the therapy for different reasons.
Conclusions: The comments and feedback facing the implementation
of the therapy suggested that several considerations must be taken into
account to promote the adherence of teenagers to CIRCuiTS.

S. RASKIN, M. SMITH, G. MILLS & E. AIKEN. Use of Goal
Management Training to Improve Prospective Memory
Performance in Individuals with Brain Injury.
Objective: Prospective memory (PM) is common after brain injury and
can impair daily functioning. One potential treatment approach is a
metacognitive strategy used successfully to improve executive functioning, Goal Management Training (GMT).
Participants and Methods: There were a total of 10 individuals with
traumatic brain injury (TBI). Mean age was 44. 25 (s.d.=5.34); 6 were
male and 4 female. The study was administered as a randomized controlled trial with a active treatment group (AT) (GMT) of 5 and an
attention control group (AC) of 5 that received information on brain
injury in a computerized education module. The groups were matched
for sex, age and education. The AC group was offered treatment at the
end. GMT was modeled after Levine et al. (2011). Each participant was
asked to identify a goal in their daily life. Sessions took place twice per
week for six weeks for one hour. The primary measure of efficacy was
Memory for Intentions Screening Test (MIST). A battery of attention,

Forty Fourth Annual INS Meeting Abstracts
memory and executive function measures and generalization measures
were used.
Results: There was significant improvement on MIST total and reduction of MIST errors for AT but not AC overall. Individuals that
demonstrated the greatest improvement were those with the highest
attention and retrospective memory scores on standardized tests. On
the neuropsychological measures there was a significant improvement
on tests of executive functioning but not other measures of cognitive
functioning only after AT. There was a significant improvement on
measures of generalization overall following the AT but not the AC.
Conclusions: GMT has been demonstrated to be an effective executive
function intervention for individuals with TBI. This study has demonstrated that it can lead to measurable improvement in PM performance.
In particular, GMT seems to be helpful for those participants who show
relatively intact attention and retrospective memory performance but
impaired PM and executive functions.

C. EAST-RICHARD, D. NADEAU & C. CELLARD. Improving
Verbal Memory in Teenagers with Psychiatric Disorder and a
History of Maltreatment: A Multiple Case Study.
Objective: Maltreatment is a risk factor for cognitive and functional
deficits during adolescence. The combination of maltreatment and psychiatric disorder is associated with important cognitive deficits. However, cognitive remediation therapy (CRT) has never been used to reduce
these deficits. This multiple case study aims to compare the effect of a
top-down CRT on verbal memory in two teenagers presenting different
neuropsychological profiles.
Participants and Methods: Case A and B both had psychiatric disorder with a history of maltreatment and they showed cognitive deficits
at baseline. Case B also had a language disorder. A neuropsychological
battery was administered followed by a computerised CRT programme
(CIRCuiTS) comprising 40 sessions. Cases A and B were reassessed
post-CRT and three months post-CRT. Reliable Change Indices were
calculated from baseline to post-CRT and from baseline to three months
post-CRT. The cognitive strategies used for verbal task were also analyzed, including semantic, serial and subjective (elaboration of one’s
own significant categories of information) strategies.
Results: After CRT, they both showed significant improvement in verbal
learning (A: RCI=2.2; B: RCI=3.7) and working memory (A: RCI=3.5;
B: RCI=4.4), as well as a significant improvement in verbal episodic
memory (RCI=3.3) for case B. This verbal improvement was accompanied by the increased use of semantic and subjective strategies for case
A, and subjective strategies for case B. Three months after CRT, they
both showed significant improvement in verbal learning (A: RCI=2.2;
B: RCI=2.2), with significant improvement in verbal episodic memory
(RCI=1.6) for case A and working memory (RCI=3.6) for case B. Case
A used semantic strategies and case B used subjective strategies.
Conclusions: These preliminary results suggest that CRT improves
verbal memory in teenagers with psychiatric disorder and a history of
maltreatment. The benefits are explained by different strategies pattern.

K.R. THOMAS, O. PUIG-NAVARRO & E.W. TWAMLEY. Age as a
Moderator of Change Following Compensatory Cognitive Training
in Severe Mental Illness.
Objective: We aimed to determine whether age moderated cognitive,
symptom, and functional changes following a 12-week Compensatory
Cognitive Training (CCT) intervention for participants with severe mental illness (SMI). CCT focused on the cognitive domains of attention,
learning, prospective memory, and executive functioning, which are
often impaired in people with SMI.

233
Participants and Methods: Seventy-seven unemployed outpatients
with SMI (46 with severe mood disorders and 31 with schizophrenia/
schizoaffective disorder; mean age=44.43 years) received CCT for 12
weeks in the context of a supported employment program. Participants
were administered cognitive, symptom severity, and functional measures
at baseline and 3-, 6-, and 12-month follow-ups, as well as at 18- and
24-months for symptom/functional measures.
Results: Mixed effects models, controlling for diagnosis, showed significant visit x age interactions such that younger participants improved
more over time on category fluency [β=-.280, t(42.10)=-2.76, p=.008]
and financial capacity [UCSD Performance-Based Skills Assessment;
β=-.194, t(54.02)=-2.21, p=.031]. Older participants showed greater
reduction in positive symptom severity [Positive and Negative Syndrome
Scale; β=-.109, t(78.35)=-2.34, p=.022] and reported greater functional improvement on the Independent Living Skills Survey [β=.118,
t(109.77)=2.05, p=.043].
Conclusions: Age moderated the effects of CCT over time on several
measures of cognition, symptom severity, and functioning. In general,
the findings were mixed such that both older and younger participants
differentially improved on cognitive and functional outcomes over time
following CCT. Younger participants improved on objective measures
of verbal processing speed and financial capacity, whereas older participants demonstrated less severe positive symptoms and reported better
subjective daily functioning.

A.M. SCHUSTER, M. LIBBEN & H. MILLER. Beyond Simple
Narrative: Biological, Neuropsychological, and Social Support
Factors Involved in Atypical Recovery from Stroke in a Single
Case Study.
Objective: In-depth analyses of unique clinical cases, such as patient
HM, have made invaluable contributions to the field of psychology
and have played a vital role in directing future research. This case
study aimed to go beyond simple narrative by utilizing qualitative and
quantitative methods to identify biological, neuropsychological (NP),
and social support factors involved in extraordinary recovery outcomes
following stroke.
Participants and Methods: This case study followed a 57-year-old
female, JD, for 3 years post-stroke. Methods included repeated functional ability assessments with various raters using the Mayo Portland
Adaptability Inventory-4 (MPAI-4), comprehensive NP testing, and
clinical interviews.
Results: JD suffered a severe subarachnoid haemorrhage and remained
in a vegetative state 6-weeks post-stroke. 6 months post-stroke, JD
followed basic 1-step commands, but suffered significant expressive
aphasia, preventing participation in even the most basic NP assessment.
Initially seen as an undesirable candidate, JD was accepted into a transitional rehabilitation centre at her spouse’s urgency. She remained there
for 2 years, before being discharged home to the care of her spouse. 3
years post-stroke, JD exhibited striking improvement in NP performance. Despite significant lingering cognitive deficits, JD showed dramatic functional improvement. She could ambulate on her own, prepare
simple meals, participate in household decisions, and be left on her own
for short periods. MPAI-4 Ability T-scores (M=50, SD=10) ranged from
severely impaired immediately post-stroke (T=77), to mild-moderately
impaired 3 years post-stroke (T=54). With support and advocacy from
her spouse, JD obtained a level of independence that starkly contrasts
her cognitive deficits.
Conclusions: This methodologically strong case study highlights the
importance of both ongoing rehabilitation and social support in stroke
recovery. Social support should be considered as a moderator of stroke
recovery in future research and treatment planning.

of Cognitive Deficits in Patients with Severe Mental Illness: an
Individual Approach.
Objective: Recently, it is suggested in the literature (Paquin et al., 2014)
that in overcoming cognitive deficits in patients with schizophrenia,
attention should be paid to tailoring the treatment more to the specific
patients needs. This improves generalization to real life situations, which
is illustrated by present case.
Participants and Methods: Patient, a 48 year old man with schizophrenia was referred by his casemanager for treatment of his cognitive
deficits. Before treatment he underwent an extensive neuropsychological assessment, deficits in executive functioning and memory were
objectified.
The 24 session protocol for the treatment of the executive dysfunctions
(Spikman et al. 2010) which leaves room for individual, personalized,
targets was executed. His goal for treatment was cleaning up his apartment –which was a terrible mess- without the help of others and, secondly, taking up his hobby as a photographer.
The training was performed by the cognitive trainings assistant (IT)
and the clinical neuropsychologist (EW).
Results: Patient needed 40 sessions to complete the protocol. It was
difficult for him to complete his homework assignments. Because of
his executive problems he had difficulties to stick to the task during
treatment, and was easily distracted. Finally, he managed to develop a
strategy for cleaning his house and he completed a photo project which
he put on an internet site. At six months follow up he still kept to his
cleaning schedule.
Conclusions: In this individualized approach of a successful cognitive
training, a standardized protocol was combined with a functional, personal treatment goal. At six months follow up, the patient was still able
to use the learned strategies.

Factors Associated with Positive Rehabilitation Outcome from
Cerebrovascular Insult as Measured by Change in Functional
Ability Using Mayo-Portland Adaptability Inventory Change
Scores.
Objective: Research has produced mixed findings in regards to variables
associated with positive rehabilitation outcomes from cardiovascular
insults. The current study aims to better understand the demographic,
socioeconomic, and differing injury sub-types that influence rehabilitative recovery.
Participants and Methods: This study involved 164 participants who
were involved in a multidisciplinary brain injury rehabilitation program. Most individuals were three months post stroke. All individuals
in the study successfully completed the Mayo-Portland Adaptability
Inventory (MPAI-4), as comprehensive measure of functional ability, at
both intake and discharge. In a linear regression model, MPAI change
scores (admission minus discharge) were used as the dependent variable.
Demographic factors (Age, Gender, and Race), Socioeconomic/Situational factors (Living Situation, Education, Substance Abuse History,
Marital Status, and Pre-injury productivity), as well as Injury subtype
information (Vascular Event Etiology and Vascular stroke type) were
used as independent variables.
Results: Our analysis indicated gender (t=-2.094; p=.038), substance
abuse history (t=2.722; p=.007), pre-injury productivity (t=-1.990;
p=.048), and vascular event etiology (t=-2.438; p=.016) were predictive of rehabilitative response. Factors not indicative of rehabilitative
change included Age, Race, Living Situation, Education, Marital Status,
and Vascular Stroke Type.
Conclusions: An overarching goal of this study was to help clarify
factorial differences in post-acute stroke functional outcomes. Given

the complexity of compounding pre-morbid factors that can influence
rehabilitation outcome, this study may help clarify those in need of
more integrative and intensive rehabilitation to achieve similar gains.

D.M. RENTZ, J. JACKSON, R.A. SPERLING, K.A. JOHNSON &
R.E. AMARIGLIO. Subjective Memory Concerns and Amyloid
Burden in Clinically Normal Individuals: the Impact of Age,
Education, and Sex.
Objective: Converging evidence suggests that subjective cognitive
concerns (SCC) has been associated with biomarker evidence of amyloid-βeta (Aβ) burden and neurodegeneration in individuals without
clinical impairment, and may serve as an early indicator of those at risk
for Alzheimer’s disease dementia (AD). Here, we sought to investigate
whether age, education, and/or sex impacts the relationship between
SCC and Aβ burden using PiB-PET imaging in clinically normal older
individuals (CN).
Participants and Methods: We studied 279 CN (59% females) enrolled in the Harvard Aging Brain Study, ages 63-90 (mean 73.6±6)
with 6-20 years of education (mean 15.8±3.1). SCC was assessed as
a composite score of the Memory Functioning Questionnaire, Everyday Cognition Scale, and the adapted Structured Telephone Interview
for Dementia Assessment. Age was measured continuously. High and
low education was categorized as >16 and ≤16 years, respectively. Aβ
burden was measured across an aggregate of cortical regions vulnerable to Aβ deposition. A series of linear regression models assessed the
potential modifying role of demographic variables with respect to Aβ
burden and SCC.
Results: Age did not modify the relationship between SCC and Aβ
burden (p=0.247). While individuals with lower education had greater
overall SCC (p=0.022), the relationship between Aβ burden and SCC
was stronger in the high education group compared to the low education group (p=0.05). Although sex did not modify the relationship
between Aβ burden and SCC in a single model, in separate models
women (p<.001) demonstrated a significant association between SCC
and Aβ burden in contrast to men (p=.372).
Conclusions: These findings suggest what those with SCC who are
highly educated and/or female, may be more perceptive of the memory
changes that place them at risk for AD progression. As the field moves
toward early detection of AD, SCC in highly educated women may
provide additional evidence of those who should be clinically followed
and referred to AD prevention trials.

A. BONNER-JACKSON & L. BORATO. Variables Affecting
Caregiver Burden in a Memory Clinic Population.
Objective: Dementia is a growing public health concern. Caregiver burden is a well-described phenomenon and refers to negative medical, social, cognitive, and emotional outcomes of providing care for individuals
with cognitive impairment or dementia (e.g., Alzheimer’s disease). Our
goal was to examine factors that may contribute to caregiver burden in
a heterogeneous memory clinic sample.
Participants and Methods: Participants included 50 caregivers of individuals who were seen for a comprehensive neuropsychological evaluation in a memory clinic setting. Mean patient age was 68.6 years.
The patient sample was heterogeneous and included individuals diagnosed with Mild Cognitive Impairment (N=28) and dementia (N=17).
The majority of caregivers (76%) were spouses. Caregivers completed

Forty Fourth Annual INS Meeting Abstracts
a self-report measure of caregiver burden (Zarit Burden Inventory), as
well as measures of patient neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPI-Q) and
an activities of daily living questionnaire (ADLQ). Composite Memory (MEM) and Executive Functioning (EXEC) variables were created
based on data from the neuropsychology exam. Regression analyses were
conducted and included MEM, EXEC, NPI-Q ratings (severity and distress), ADLQ, MOCA, and patient age as predictors of caregiver burden.
Results: Only functional impairment and subjective caregiver distress
on the NPI-Q were significantly related to subjective caregiver burden,
while burden was not significantly related to either MEM or EXEC.
Additionally, a significant negative correlation was identified between
EXEC and total functional impairment.
Conclusions: Findings are consistent with previous work linking caregiver burden with patient neuropsychiatric symptoms and functional
impairment. Additionally, we propose that progressive declines in cognitive function (particularly executive functioning) may result in worsening functional impairment, which in turn increases caregiver burden.

E. WOO, J. RINGMAN, L. APOSTOLOVA & J. RAZANI. Tower Test
Performance between MCI and AD Individuals.
Objective: Previous research has demonstrated that the Delis- Kaplan
Executive Function System (D-KEFS) Tower Test as a good measure
of various executive functioning skills (Swanson, 2005). Mild Cognitive
Impairment (MCI) typically precedes the onset of dementia, particularly
Alzheimer’s disease (AD). The purpose of this study was to assess the
differences between MCI, AD, and normal controls on the D-KEFS
Tower Test.
Participants and Methods: There is 169 participants composed of 3
groups: 57 AD, 46 MCI, and 66 normal controls participated. Participants previously diagnosed with Probable AD and the Peterson et al.
(2001) research criteria for MCI were recruited from medical centers in
the greater Los Angeles area. For the D-KEFS Tower Test participants
were presented with a diagram displaying different size discs placed in
specific formation on pegs. Participants are then required to replicate
the design while not violating specific rules (e.g., can only move one disc
at a time, cannot place a larger disc on a smaller one).
Results: A series of ANOVAS were conducted which revealed significant differences between groups on the tower total achievement score
F(2,144)=21.552, p=.001. Specifically normal controls outperformed
MCI and AD, and MCI outperformed AD. However, there were no significant differences found between groups on the tower test rule violation ratio F(2,145)=1.137, p=.324 and tower test total accuracy ratio
F(2,145)=1.098, p=.336.
Conclusions: Overall, it appears that MCI shows impairment, albeit
milder, on the overall ability to perform this task of executive functioning. It appears that even at very mild stages of cognitive impairment
individuals have difficulty with the organization, planning, and execution of commands required by this task.

of Differences in Neuroimaging Biomarkers between Middle-Aged
African-American and White/Non-Hispanic Individuals with a
Parental History of Alzheimer’s Disease.
Objective: African Americans are at greater risk for Alzheimer’s disease
(AD) relative to White/Non-Hispanics. Unfortunately, neuroimaging
studies of cognitively-normal individuals at risk for AD have included individuals who are almost exclusively White/Non-Hispanic and therefore

235
little is known about the process and mechanism of changes in brain
structure/function in African Americans at risk for AD. We examined
differences in biomarkers of brain structure/function between African
Americans and White/Non-Hispanics with a parental history of AD.
Participants and Methods: Seventy-eight middle-aged children of
persons with AD underwent genetic testing, neuropsychological evaluation, and neuroimaging. An exploratory convenience sample was created
comprised of 15 African American (14 female) and 56 White/Non-Hispanic (38 female) participants. Voxel-based morphometry (VBM), arterial spin labeling (ASL), and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) analyses
were conducted using SPM8 (Statistical Parametric Mapping).
Results: Relative to White/Non-Hispanics, African Americans in this
sample showed greater gray matter volume in the bilateral occipital and
parietal lobes, bilateral posterior cingulate, and left inferior and anterior
temporal lobe (voxel familywise error rate [FWE] p=.05, cluster size
[k]=20); reduced blood flow in the bilateral parahippocampal gyrus and
hippocampus, bilateral thalamus, and left posterior cingulate (cluster
FWE p=.002, k=3500); as well as differences in white matter integrity
in the left posterior cingulate and the splenium of the corpus callosum
(voxel FWE p=.05, k=20).
Conclusions: AD may present differently among African Americans;
however, little is known about the etiology of brain changes and their
interactions with genetic and other risk factors (e.g., cardiovascular and
psychosocial). These results warrant further investigation and underscore the importance of including African Americans and other minorities in neuroimaging studies of individuals at risk for AD.

B.L. DEFEIS, C. ZHU, K. ORNSTEIN, Y. GU, Y. STERN &
S. COSENTINO. Healthcare Outcomes of Dementia Diagnosis
Disclosure: Patients Uninformed of Dementia Diagnoses Are More
Likely to Be Hospitalized.
Objective: Disclosure of dementia diagnosis to patients remains controversial in part due to family concerns about patient quality of life. The
extent to which such disclosures are associated with patient outcomes
such as healthcare utilization is unknown. The current study examines
the association of dementia diagnosis disclosure in relation to Medicare
based outcomes.
Participants and Methods: Data were collected from 238 patients
diagnosed with Probable AD or Dementia with Lewy Bodies from the
multi-center Predictors of Disease Course in Alzheimer’s Disease study.
Caretakers were asked (yes/no) if patients had been informed of their
diagnosis. Data on healthcare use were obtained from patients’ Medicare
claims and were matched to interview data according to the year of
the clinical evaluation. Medicare use and demographics were compared
between informed and uninformed patients using chi square analyses
and analyses of variance covarying for age, gender, education, medical
comorbidities, and dementia severity.
Results: Out of 238 patients, 67.6% were informed of their diagnoses,
and 32.4% were uninformed. Uninformed patients were more likely to
be female, widowed, have fewer years of education, and to have children
as their caretakers who did not live with them. There were no significant
differences between groups in dementia severity or medical comorbidities. Adjusting for these variables, uninformed patients (29.9%) were
hospitalized more frequently than informed patients (15.5%; p=.003).
Conclusions: Patients who are uninformed of their dementia diagnoses
are more likely to be hospitalized. Disclosure of dementia diagnosis was
associated with characteristics of both the patient and the caretaker.
Consideration of healthcare outcomes may be factored into the discourse
between clinicians and caretakers of whether to disclose diagnoses to
patients with dementia.

J. BERG, J. DURANT, S.J. BANKS & J.B. MILLER. Comparing
the Test of Practical Judgment with the Neuropsychological
Assessment Battery Judgment subtest in a Dementia Population.
Objective: Poor judgment is often associated with cognitive decline and
is an important consideration when assessing older adults suspected of
dementia. The Test of Practical Judgment (TOP-J; Rabin et al., 2007)
and Judgment subtest from the Neuropsychological Assessment Battery
(NAB-JDG; Stern & White, 2003) are both interview-based questionnaires designed to measure judgment. Observations in practice suggest
a consistent discrepancy in a dementia population, such that NAB-JDG
performance is often considerably better than TOP-J performance. This
study sought to explore this phenomenon in greater detail.
Participants and Methods: Records from 48 consecutive referrals
(Age: M = 73.0, SD = 10.0; Education: M = 14.0, SD = 2.7; 54% female)
seen for neuropsychological evaluation as part of routine care in an
outpatient neurodegenerative disorders clinic were reviewed. Measures
of interest included the TOP-J and NAB-JDG. Discrepancy scores were
calculated between z-scores and a partial correlation was conducted
controlling for age. A paired-samples t-test was calculated to compare
performance on TOP-J and NAB-JDG.
Results: The two judgment measures were significantly correlated (r
= 0.37, p <0.05). Discrepancies between z-scores ranged from -4.9 to
1.0 (M = 1.4, SD = 1.2) with 56% of participants obtaining discrepancy
scores greater than 1 standard deviation. Z-scores between the TOP-J
(M = -1.45, SD = 1.31) and NAB-JDG (M = -.06, SD = 1.11) were
significantly different; t(47) = -7.89, p <.001.
Conclusions: In a dementia population, individuals perform significantly better on the NAB-JDG than the TOP-J, and generally within
normative expectation. Even though both tests are designed to measure
judgment ability, this discrepancy suggests that they may be measuring different constructs. Relying solely on the NAB-JDG subtest in a
dementia population may lead to under identification of individuals
with difficulties.

M. ENNOK, K. ANNI, K. BURK & Ü. LINNAMÄGI. Performance
of WAIS-III Digit-Symbol subtest and Incidental Learning
procedures in patients with Alzheimer’s disease.
Objective: Digit-Symbol (DS) subtest is one of the most sensitive subtests of neurological disorders in Wechsler scales. WAIS-III includes
optional procedures but these have not received much attention. This
study examines the performance of DS subtest and its optional procedures in patients with Alzheimer’s disease.
Participants and Methods: The sample is 20 patients with AD (mean
age: 75.1 yrs; mean MMSE: 21.9) and 20 healthy controls (mean age:
74.8 yrs; mean MMSE: 29.1). Participants were administered the Estonian version of WAIS-III DS Coding, Copy and Incidental Learning
procedures. In addition to standard scoring we noted number of qualitative observations (repetitions, perseverations, intrusions, distortions,
confabulations, overwriting, missing answers). To evaluate changes in
speed, the proportional scatter score was found (scatter between 30-sec
intervals divided with raw score).
Results: AD patients performed significantly worse in Coding
(U=69.500; p<.001; mean scores AD M=6.4 (SD=2.7), controls M=9.3
(SD=1.9)) and in Copy (U=85.500; p=0,001, mean scores AD M=53.9
(SD=22.3), controls M=80.55 (SD=27.2)). The speed in both tasks did
not differ significantly between the groups. Errors made in Coding and
Copy were rare, but they were observed in both groups. Control group
gave significantly more correct answers in Pairing (U=40.500; p<.001,

AD M=2.2 (SD=3.5), controls M=8.7 (SD=3.5)) and also in Free Recall
(U=36.000; p<.001, AD M=3 (SD=2.2), controls M=6.6 (SD=1.7)).
The AD patients had more missing answers. Other error types observed
were distortions, intrusions and confabulations but these were seen in
both groups.
Conclusions: AD patients show deficit in speed of processing in both
Coding and Copy task. They have also poorer incidental learning mostly
because of not remembering the target symbols. Other patient groups
may show a different profile of qualitative observations of DS Coding
and optional procedures, that can lead to better understanding of cognitive deficits in various neurological conditions.

G. BARON, K.N. MORGAN & R.R. FALLOWS. The Relationship
Between Subjective Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADL)
Complaints and Objective Measures of Functioning.
Objective: This study examined differences in subjective functional
complaints (SFC) between two patient populations, major neurocognitive disorder (MND) and no-MND and their collateral informants, in
addition to how SFC correlated with objective measures of functional
status. Hypothesis: Stronger correlations would be observed between
objective measures and collateral reports of SFC compared to patient
report.
Participants and Methods: This study utilized archival data collected
from an outpatient neuropsychology clinic. Participants completed the
Texas Functional Living Scales (TFLS; total T-score) or the Pillbox
Test (pass/fail) and underwent a clinical interview (total number of
concerns). Eighty-one participants were included in the study of which
59 had no-MND (70.8(7.1) yrs old; 14.2(3.3) yrs education; 20 collaterals) and 22 had MND (75.8(6.9) yrs old; 13.1(3.4) yrs education; 7
collaterals). Pearson correlations (TFLS and SFC) and Spearmen-Rho
(Pillbox and SFC) were used to examine strength of correlation while
paired t-tests were used to determine differences between reports of SFC.
Results: Patient and collateral total SFC were significantly different across both patient pairs: (no-MND patient (0.8(0.9)), collateral
(1.2(1.2)); t(19)=-2.37, p=.03)(MND patient (1.9(1.7)) collateral
(2.4(1.7)); t(14)=-2.27, p=.04). Correlations between TFLS and SFC
in MND patients (r=-.42, p=.06) and collaterals (r=-.48, p=.09) approached significance while the no MND group did not. No group SFC
was significantly correlated with the pillbox test.
Conclusions: Significant differences between collateral and patient
report of SFC were observed regardless of diagnosis. There was a trend
toward significant correlation between the TFLS and patient/collateral
report in the MND group: however, no correlation reached significance
for functional measures and SFC. Findings suggest objective functional
measures may be providing information about functional status that
may be different and meaningful from patient/collateral report.

J. FERRER-ARAGÓN & V. PATIÑO TORREALVA. Semantic
processing of concrete and abstract words in Alzheimer’s disease
and primary progressive aphasia.
Objective: Analyze differences of semantic processing between patients
with Alzheimer’s disease and primary progressive aphasia, through development of two new tasks that evaluate semantic of concrete and
abstract words
Participants and Methods: Four patients with AD, three patients with
PPA and seven healthy volunteers who composed control group. Were
used two new tasks to evaluate semantic processing of concrete and
abstract words: Semantic similarity task and Semantic verification task
Results: Semantic similarity task: There was no difference at percentage of correct responses among patients with AD and control group in

Forty Fourth Annual INS Meeting Abstracts
concrete (U = 6.0, p = .108) and abstract stimuli (U = 10.0, p = .335).
Patients with PPA was significantly lower than control group to concrete
(U = .500, p = .018) and abstract stimuli (U = .500, p = .010).
Semantic verification task: Percentage of correct answers in patients
with AD was lower than control group in abstract stimuli (U = 3.5, p
= .040), but there was no differences in concrete stimuli (U = 6.0, p =
.185). Patients with PPA was below than control group (OR = 0.0, p
= .015) in both types of stimuli (concrete: U = 0.5, p = .010; abstract:
U = 0.0, p = .012).
Conclusions: Performance of patients with PPA shows more severe
deficit of concrete and abstract knowledge (Hoffman & Lambon Ralph,
2011; Hoffman et al, 2013; Jefferies et al, 2009). This effect could
be explained by using tasks that involve a high load semantics that
involves not only the recognition of the meaning of words, but also the
development of a semantic judgment, reducing as far as possible the
effect of processing information. Patients with AD show higher performance than patients with PPA, but are slightly affected in tasks that
involving a judgment on the semantic relationship, especially abstract
concepts. This effect could be explained because concrete words have
a wider contextual support and activate associative richer information
than abstract concepts (Schwanenflügel, 1991).

Sensitivity of Component Attentional Measures to Subtle
Cognitive Changes and Real-World Driving Performance in Early
Alzheimer’s Disease: A Longitudinal Examination.
Objective: Distinct components of attention are differentially sensitive
to early cognitive changes in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and to real-world
driving performance. This study examined the ability of neurocognitive
tests of attention to: a) detect subtle cognitive changes in high functioning drivers with AD and b) predict current and evolving driving risk
in this population.
Participants and Methods: Older drivers diagnosed with very mild
(n=43) or mild (n=21) AD completed a standardized on-road test at
baseline and 6 months. Tests of spatial orienting, alerting, inhibitory
control, visual search, and visuomotor tracking were administered under single- and dual-task conditions at both time points, along with a
standard neuropsychological battery.
Results: Repeated-measures ANOVAs with Time (0, 6 months) and
Test Condition (single, dual) as factors revealed differential cognitive
changes across the two groups: For very mild AD, accuracy under dual-task conditions for visuomotor tracking and visual search declined
over 6 months; for mild AD, alerting under dual task conditions and
inhibitory control under both single- and dual-task conditions declined
over 6 months. Regression analyses also revealed that single-task alerting
and orienting predicted current driving performance, while single-task
inhibitory control performance predicted 6-month decline in driving.
Conclusions: In high-functioning drivers with AD, tests of attention
were able to detect cognitive decline over 6 months and to predict current and evolving driving risk. Consistent with the presence of divided
attention deficits early in AD, attentional measures under dual-task
conditions were particularly sensitive to decline, with specific attentional
components differing with disease severity. In contrast, single-task conditions that more effectively assess distinct attentional processes were
more sensitive to driving performance. Component attentional measures
may be useful for early detection and assessment of subtle cognitive
decline, as well as driving risk.

Apathy on The Frontal Systems Behavior Scale in Frontotemporal
Dementia And Early-Onset Alzheimer’s Disease.
Objective: To examine neuroanatomical correlates of symptoms of
apathy in behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and early-onset Alzheimer’s disease (EAD).
Participants and Methods: 15 FTD (Mage=59.5;SD=11.4) and 20
EAD (Mage=59.1;SD=5.3) patients underwent MRI, and their caregivers completed the FrSBe to quantify frontal-executive symptoms. Subscales were developed from the FrSBe apathy subscale (AP) to assess
cognitive (AP-C), behavioral (AP-B), and emotional (AP-E) symptoms
of apathy. Surface-based reconstruction was applied to each MRI scan
to extract gray matter thickness measures(TM). TMs within bilateral
superior frontal regions were extracted for each subject to provide a
numeric summary of regional thickness. Partial correlations were used
to investigate the relationship between apathy and frontal thickness in
FTD and EAD patients. Voxel-wise analyses between apathy and white
matter integrity (fractional anisotropy, FA) were conducted using tract
based spatial statistics (TBSS) in FSL.
Results: FTD subjects (M=53.5,SD=8.9) demonstrated significantly
higher AP scores than EAD subjects (M=32.6,SD=8.5) (p<.001), as
well as higher scores on AP-B, AP-C and AP-E subscales (ps<.001).
Controlling for age, FTD patients’ right superior frontal thickness
(RSFT) negatively correlated with total AP scores (r=-.54, p<.05) and
AP-C scores (r =-.56,p <.05). AP-B or AP-E did not significantly correlate with RSFT (ps>.05). Conversely, EAD patients’ RSFT negatively
correlated with only AP-B (r =-.47,p<.05). No other AP scores were
significantly associated with RSFT (ps>.05). Across both groups, more
apathy was associated with lower FA in primarily frontal white matter
tracts (p<.05 corrected). The pattern of findings was the same across
all subscales.
Conclusions: In FTD and EAD, apathy was associated with the right
superior frontal cortex and frontal white matter tracts. Greater characterization of the neuroanatomical basis of psychiatric symptoms could
aid in tailored intervention strategies.

J. RINGMAN, M.J. WRIGHT & E. WOO. Longitudinal Assessment
of Two Types of Prospective Memory in Healthy Aging and Mild
Cognitive Impairment.
Objective: Prospective memory (PM) involves planning and executing an intended action in the future. PM is often measured by asking
participants to perform a simple action when signaled by a cue, but in
daily life, PM can depend upon specific contingencies (e.g., remembering to take one medication after a meal and another medication on an
empty stomach). The current study examines longitudinal changes in
two types of PM in healthy older adults and persons with mild cognitive
impairment (MCI).
Participants and Methods: Healthy older adults (n = 49) and participants with MCI (n = 36) were administered the PM tasks at baseline and
at one year follow up. Participants were instructed to request a “pill”
following the completion of 8 cognitive tasks in order to examine simple PM. To examine contingency-based PM, participants were further
instructed to remember to request one “pill” if the task just completed
required memorization and two “pills” if it did not.
Results: ANOVAs were conducted to evaluate the impact of diagnosis
and time separately for simple PM and contingency-based PM. For
simple PM, there were no significant effects of diagnosis, time, or their
interaction. For contingency-based PM, the healthy older controls outperformed MCI across both the baseline and follow up assessments.
Conclusions: We found that when participants were asked to execute a
simple intention in the future, there were no differences in performance

238
for healthy older adults and persons with MCI. However, when the intention was dependent upon a contingency, those with MCI performed
more poorly than healthy older controls. This finding demonstrates
that individuals with MCI have difficulties with more complex forms
of prospective memory.

E.R. HARTMAN, S. CORREIA, R. CABEEN, D. LAIDLAW,
P.F. MALLOY, S.P. SALLOWAY & S. DEONI. Effects of
Cerebrovascular Risk on White Matter Network Characteristics
in Mild Cognitive Impairment and Alzheimer’s Dementia.
Objective: This study’s objective was to determine the effect of cerebrovascular (CV) risk on diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) based white matter
(WM) networks in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer’s
dementia (AD) using graph theoretical analysis. AD and subcortical
ischemic vascular disease (SIVD) are often comorbid. SIVD is related
to CV risks. Some have proposed that SIVD causes or exacerbates AD
or that they share an upstream mechanism. We examined whether the
relationship between CV risk and AD reflects parallel versus interacting
processes. We hypothesized the latter; that CV risk would interactively
impact both frontosubcortical WM networks typically affected by SIVD
and temporo-limbic-parietal (TLP) WM networks affected by AD.
Participants and Methods: Participants were MCI=16, mild AD=11,
moderate-severe AD=6. CV risk was the sum of risk factors. Structural
network models were created using whole-brain dMRI tractography
and T1 MRI gray matter segmentation with Freesurfer. Quantitative
analysis included global and local measures weighted by fractional anisotropy. Local frontosubcortical and TLP connections were selected
using apriori gray matter areas. AD severity was estimated by total
gray matter volume.
Results: In regression analyses, CV risk showed no effect on global
graph theory metrics. In frontosubcortical networks, higher CV risk
associated with more network segregation and higher local connectivity.
In TLP networks, CV risk associated with less segregation and lower
local connectivity. Interaction analysis showed a more widespread and
inconsistent effect of CV risk in more severe AD.
Conclusions: CV risk increased segregation and local connectivity of
frontosubcortical WM networks typically affected in SIVD and had the
opposite effect in TLP WM networks primarily affected in AD. These
findings suggest a regionally specific interactive impact of CV risk on
network connectivity in AD.

M.J. MELOY, D. GALASKO & C.E. WIERENGA. Relationship
between Cerebral Blood Flow and Cerebrospinal Fluid Levels of
Amyloid Beta and Tau in Normal Cognitive Aging.
Objective: Alterations in cerebral blood flow (CBF) are associated with
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) risk and may reflect early disease pathology.
What is still unclear is how changes in CBF relate to cerebrospinal fluid
(CSF) biomarkers of AD.
Participants and Methods: Twenty-five cognitively normal older
adults (mean age=70.8, SD=3.5) underwent arterial spin labeling (ASL)
MRI to measure whole brain resting CBF and a lumbar puncture to
assess CSF levels of amyloid beta (Aβ42), phosphorylated tau (pTau),
and total tau (tTau). Linear mixed effect models preliminarily investigated the voxel-wise relationship between CBF and each biomarker
separately, controlling for age.
Results: Significant positive associations between CBF and Aβ42 levels
were found in brain regions implicated in AD-related degeneration,
including the bilateral medial temporal lobe (MTL) (hippocampus and
parahippocampal gyrus) (corrected p <.05). Positive associations between CBF and CSF levels of pTau and tTau were found in widespread

frontal brain regions, including the medial frontal gyrus and the anterior
cingulate (p <.05).
Conclusions: Results suggest that increased brain perfusion in the MTL
is selectively associated with less amyloid (higher CSF Aβ42 levels).
Contrarily, higher CBF was related to higher tau pathology, possibly
reflective of cortical neurovascular dysregulation. This is the first study
to investigate the voxel-wise relationship between ASL-measured CBF
and CSF derived biomarkers of AD, and results suggest that CBF is
differentially sensitive to levels of Aβ42 and tau. Future studies should
investigate the association between CBF, CSF-measured AD biomarkers,
and cognitive performance in cognitively normal and preclinical samples
to elucidate the combined predictive value of CBF and AD biomarkers
in detecting early cognitive decline.

K. HAZLETT ELVERMAN, C.M. FIGUEROA, R.J. MCKINDLES,
B.D. SCHMIT & K.A. NIELSON. Preclinical Markers of Risk for
Alzheimer’s Disease in a Task of Inhibitory Control.
Objective: Significant advances have been made in understanding Alzheimer’s disease (AD), but our ability to accurately predict who will
develop AD remains limited. Executive functioning has been neglected
as a preclinical marker of AD, despite the vital role of these abilities
(e.g., planning, set shifting, inhibition) in everyday functioning. Indeed,
inhibitory deficits have been found to predict impairment in activities
of daily living, an important criterion in the diagnosis of AD. This study
examined executive functioning differences in event related potentials
(ERPs) based on age and genetic risk for AD (+/- apolipoprotein-E ε4;
APOE-ε4).
Participants and Methods: Participants included 42 young adults
(73% female; Mage=20, Medu=14) and 49 healthy, cognitively intact
older adults (71% female; Mage=80, Medu=15). Genetic testing was
conducted for older adults, 24 of whom were APOE-ε4 carriers. Participants completed the Parametric Go/No-Go/Stop task while ERPs
were collected.
Results: Significant ERP differences by genetic risk emerged such that
APOE-ε4+ participants exhibited
significantly more negative amplitudes than APOE-ε4- participants at
midline electrodes in response to Stop trials (Fz: p=.003, FCz: p=.006,
Cz: p=.035) and No-Go lures (Fz: p=.021, FCz: p=.009, Cz: p=.039).
These neural differences were seen in the absence of genetic risk differences in task performance. Expected age differences also emerged, with
older adults exhibiting slower ERP latencies, particularly to Stop trials.
These results were consistent with behavioral data showing significantly
slower reaction times in older compared to young adults in Go, No-Go,
and Stop conditions (all p<.001).
Conclusions: This study revealed significant genetic differences in
ERP’s in healthy older adults, revealing a new early marker of AD risk,
and indicated the importance of executive abilities, such as inhibition,
in preclinical AD. Inexpensive and easily accessible ERPs may be more
sensitive to preclinical risk than cognitive testing alone.

L. APOSTOLOVA, K. TINGUS & E. WOO. Longitudinal Assessment
of Metacognition in Mild Cognitive Impairment and Dementia.
Objective: Metacognition involves awareness and monitoring of one’s
own cognitive abilities. Poor metacognition is one hallmark of dementia. In this study, we evaluated longitudinal changes in metacognition.
Participants and Methods: Participants included 78 controls, 108
MCI, and 48 dementia participants. Participants were given brief descriptions of each of 6 cognitive tasks and the total scores possible. They
made predictions about how they would score on each task, and then

Forty Fourth Annual INS Meeting Abstracts
following task performance, they made postdictions about their scores.
Metacognition was the difference between participants’ actual scores
and self-ratings.
Results: ANCOVAs were conducted to determine the longitudinal impact of diagnosis, metacognition (pre- vs post-diction) and cognitive
task on prediction accuracy. At baseline, there was a significant interaction among diagnosis, metacognition, and task; for verbal learning,
the dementia group overestimated performance, the MCI and control
groups underestimated performance, and all groups’ postdictions were
more accurate than predictions. For visuoconstruction, all groups underestimated performance, and postdictions were more accurate than
predictions.
At follow-up, there were significant interactions between diagnosis and
metacognition and for diagnosis by task type; again, the dementia group
overestimated performance, the MCI and controls groups underestimated performance, and all groups’ postdictions were more accurate
than predictions. In addition, the MCI groups’ prediction accuracy was
the worst for all tasks, and the controls were more accurate than the
dementia group only for nonverbal memory and verbal learning tasks.
Conclusions: In summary, metacognition is poor in MCI in regard to
general underestimation of performance. At follow-up, the MCI groups’
prediction accuracy was worse than the control and dementia groups
for all tasks, while controls only had better prediction accuracy than
the dementia group depending on task type.

Age and Semantic Specificity of Famous Names in AD and
Individuals at Genetic Risk for AD.
Objective: There is considerable effort to identify measures sensitive
to cognitive differences in pre-clinical Alzheimer’s Disease (AD). One
approach is the comparison of individuals at varying genetic risk. To
date, the focus has been on episodic memory. However, AD also involves
impairment in retrieval of more recently acquired concepts, particularly
for more specific features. Here, we compared the performance of AD
and two cognitively intact groups (CI) with different gene risk status on
famous name discrimination for recent and remote names with probes
at different levels of semantic specificity.
Participants and Methods: 49 participants (ages 69-87): 14 cognitively intact APOE e4 carriers (CI+), 19 cognitively intact non-carriers
(CI-), and 16 AD were administered a famous name discrimination task
for 60 recent famous names (within 10 years), 60 remote famous names
(40 years+), and 60 non-famous names. Probes of increasing semantic
specificity followed: categorical (reason for fame), associative (related
name), and attribute (specific accomplishment).
Results: The AD group correctly discriminated a greater proportion
of remote names relative to recent names compared to the two CI gene
risk groups. (all p’s < .01). This pattern became more pronounced as
semantic specificity increased. The CI+ showed a similar pattern: significantly greater accuracy for remote relative to recent names compared
to the CI- at both the categorical (p = .03) and associative semantic
levels (p = .01).
Conclusions: The investigation of person-identity semantic knowledge,
particularly for specific semantic features of recent versus remote famous names may be useful in pre-clinical identification of individuals
at risk for AD. These findings also have implications for current models
of long-term memory consolidation.

P. LU, G.J. LEE & M.F. MENDEZ. Executive Dysfunction and
Reduction in Cortical Thickness Distinguish Behavioral Variant
Frontotemporal Dementia From Early-Onset Alzheimer’s Disease.
Objective: Early-onset forms of dementia, such as behavioral variant
frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD) and early-onset Alzheimer’s disease
(EOAD), are frequently misdiagnosed. The purpose of the study was to
examine the diagnostic utility of a caregiver-based measure of executive
function, the Executive Dysfunction (ED) subscale from the Frontal
Systems Behavior Scale (FrsBE), and surface-based morphometric measures of cortical thickness.
Participants and Methods: Fifteen bvFTD (Mage=59.5, SD=11.4) and
20 EOAD (Mage=59.1, SD=5.3) patients underwent MRI and caregivers
completed the FrSBe, yielding the ED score. Surface-based reconstruction was applied to each MRI scan. Thickness values within selected
regions of interest were extracted to provide a numeric summary of
regional thickness. Hierarchical logistic regression of ED score and cortical thickness was used to discriminate between bvFTD and EOAD.
Results: BvFTD patients (M=68.1, SD=14.2) experienced more ED
compared to EOAD patients (M=47.7, SD=13.3) (p<.001). Controlling
for multiple comparisons, bvFTD patients showed gray matter (GM) loss
in bilateral frontal regions, while EOAD patients presented with GM loss
in left parietal regions. Compared to thickness alone (77.1% classified),
the combination of ED and bilateral superior frontal thickness was
significantly better at classifying (94.3%) bvFTD and EOAD patients
[χ2(4)=31.4, p<.001], explaining between 59.2% (Cox and Snell R2)
and 79.5% (Nagelkerke R2) of the variance in diagnostic group.
Conclusions: Compared to EOAD, bvFTD patients show a greater loss
of GM in frontal regions, specifically the right and left superior frontal
cortex, as well as experience more severe symptoms of ED. The combination of caregiver ratings and cortical measures more effectively
discriminated between these misdiagnosed dementias, aiding in the
differential diagnosis of bvFTD and EOAD.

J.W. GRIFFIN, K. GRAJZEL & B.E. GAVETT. Effectiveness
and Unique Contribution of Neuropsychological Tests in the
Differential Diagnosis of Dementia.
Objective: Clinical diagnosis of dementia considers multiple factors.
Among them, neuropsychological test performance (NP) and disease
severity are weighed heavily. A latent dementia phenotype, δ, quantifies
dementia severity using cognitive and functional indicators. However, δ
has not been investigated nor compared to the neuropsychological data
from which it originates on efficacy in differentiating dementia etiologies. This study compares the effectiveness and measures the relative
contributions of δ and NP in differential diagnosis within the National
Alzheimer’s Coordinating Center (NACC) database.
Participants and Methods: Individuals given one of four clinical diagnoses (Alzheimer’s disease (AD), Dementia with Lewy Bodies (DLB),
Frontotemporal Dementia (FTD), Vascular Dementia (VaD)) at initial NACC visit were analyzed. Dyad samples (e.g., AD v DLB) were
matched on sex, race, ethnicity, education, age, APOE ε4 alleles, handedness, and propensity scores (derived from preceding variables). Six
logistic regression models predicting diagnosis of each possible dyad
were performed.
Results: Across all six comparisons, NP demonstrated superior area
under the curve (AUC) values to δ in classifying clinical diagnosis (AUC
for AD v DLB: NP = .76, δ = .59; AD v FTD: NP = .76, δ = .59; AD v
VaD: NP = .78, δ = .64; FTD v DLB: NP = .73, δ = .52; DLB v VaD:
NP = .68, δ = .51; FTD v VaD: NP = .70, δ = .52). NP also represented
a greater relative contribution (R2) to diagnosis than δ (R2 of NP, .154
to .245; R2 of δ, .002 to .012).
Conclusions: Although δ comprises all of the NP tests used in these
analyses, NP is better than δ at classifying dementia subtypes and

240
uniquely explains approximately 15-25% of the variance in assignment
of diagnostic category. The results support previous contentions that
δ is most suitable as a measure of dementia severity, not differential
diagnosis.

& A.L. JEFFERSON. Insulin Sensitivity, Neuropsychological
Performance, and Cognitive Diagnosis: The Vanderbilt Memory
& Aging Project.
Objective: Insulin resistance is associated with cognitive impairment
and risk for the development of Alzheimer’s disease. This study examines
whether insulin sensitivity relates to neuropsychological performance in
older adults with normal cognition (NC) and mild cognitive impairment
(MCI) and whether these associations interact with cognitive diagnosis
or apolipoprotein e4 (APOE4) status.
Participants and Methods: Participants were drawn from the Vanderbilt Memory & Aging Project, a case-control longitudinal study investigating vascular health and brain aging. At enrollment, NC (n=137,
73±7 years, 41% female) and MCI (n=137, 73±8 years, 40% female)
underwent fasting blood draw and comprehensive neuropsychological
protocol. Insulin sensitivity was calculated using quantitative insulin
sensitivity check index (QUICKI). Linear regressions, adjusted for age,
sex, race, education, body mass index, systolic blood pressure, prevalent
cardiovascular disease, cognitive diagnosis, and APOE4, cross-sectionally related QUICKI to neuropsychological performance. Secondary
analyses tested heterogeneous effects of QUICKI with QUICKI x diagnosis and QUICKI x APOE4 interactions, and subgroup analyses.
Results: There were no main effects between QUICKI and neuropsychological performances (p-values>0.13). There were significant interactions for QUICKI x cognitive diagnosis on California Verbal Learning
Test (CVLT) learning (β=-78.53, p=0.006) and CVLT delayed recall
(β=-27.10, p=0.008). MCI participants with increased insulin sensitivity performed worse on CVLT learning (β=-51.28, p=0.04). NC that
were APOE4 positive performed worse on Trail Making B (β=261.72,
p=0.03).
Conclusions: The effects of insulin sensitivity on memory performance
vary depending on cognitive diagnosis and APOE4 status. Future work
will assess the interaction of insulin sensitivity, cognitive diagnosis, and
APOE status on longitudinal cognitive changes.

Conclusions: As expected, a decline in cognitive abilities was associated
with more depression. However, functional ability was positively correlated with depression, which could be related to participants having
more awareness when they are more functional and are able to report
their depressive symptoms. In addition, other factors such as stress, caregiver assistance, and/or demographic variables (e.g., education, gender,
and ethnicity) may play a role in the relationship between functional
ability and depression. This should be examined in future research.
Lastly, longitudinal data needs to be examined to determine if decline
in cognition and functional ability as a result of AD contributes to more
depressive symptoms in the future. Findings from this study may contribute to improving treatments and quality of life in AD participants.

E.A. LIVANOS, A. RAMADAN, C. CHRISTODOULOU, E. ROSEMAN,
T. PRESTON & B.K. LEBOWITZ. Stability of HART Estimated IQ
in Clinically Referred Patients.
Objective: Estimating baseline intellectual capacity is a critical component of the neuropsychological evaluation. The Hopkins Adult Reading
Test (HART) is a single word reading test that produces an estimate of
IQ in approximately five minutes. Further, IQ estimates based on similar
measures are believed to be relatively resilient to the adverse cognitive
influence of many neuropathological processes. Thus, measures like
the HART are particularly useful in the evaluation of patients who are
suspected of having a neurodegenerative condition. While reliability and
validity data are available, limited research has explored the stability of
the HART in clinically referred individuals. The current study explored
the stability of the HART in a clinically referred sample of patients seen
in a neurology department.
Participants and Methods: The study sample consisted of 84 patients
(Mean age = 59.7 years; SD = 15.5) who were seen on two occasions.
Follow-up assessment occurred after an average interval of 18 months.
Results: Similar to published reliability data, baseline and follow-up
estimated IQ scores were highly correlated (r = .95, p < .01). Further,
the modal difference between estimated IQ at baseline and at follow-up
was zero, and 96% of the sample performed within 4 points of the
estimated baseline IQ score. The overall sample means were almost
identical (Baseline Estimated IQ = 106.6; Follow-up Estimated IQ =
106.5). Further, the correlation between baseline and follow-up testing
was unchanged when the sample was split and younger (<61 years of
age) and older (> 60 years of age) participants were analyzed separately.
Conclusions: Given the findings, the current study provides support
for the stability of the HART in the estimation of IQ in clinical settings.

Earlier Age of Diagnosis in Alzheimer Disease by Sex: The Additive
Effect of Traumatic Brain Injury History and Apolipoprotein e4.
Objective: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) and apolipoprotein ε4 (Apoe4)
are risk factors for Alzheimer Disease (AD). Prior studies suggest these
factors may interact and be moderated by sex. We utilized a large national cohort to examine whether an interaction between history of TBI
and Apoe4 was associated with earlier age of AD diagnosis by sex.
Participants and Methods: Subjects with a clinical diagnosis of AD
were obtained from the National Alzheimer’s Coordinating Center Uniform Data Set, stratified by sex (n female=2656; n male=2115), and
categorized based on self-reported lifetime TBI with loss of consciousness but no chronic deficit (TBI+ vs TBI-) and presence of Apoe4. The
interaction of TBI history and Apoe4 on age of diagnosis was examined
using ANCOVA, accounting for race, education, and family history of
dementia.

Forty Fourth Annual INS Meeting Abstracts
Results: Age of diagnosis differed by TBI history and Apoe4 independently. TBI+ subjects were diagnosed with AD on average 2.4 and
1.9 years earlier (p≤.01) than TBI- subjects for females (M Age=73.9
vs 76.3) and males respectively (M Age=73.7 vs 75.6). Age of AD diagnosis was 2.4 and 1.8 years earlier (p≤.01), respectively, for female
(M Age=75.2 vs 77.6) and male (M Age=74.7 vs 76.5) Apoe4 carriers
relative to non-carriers. Relative to those with a history of TBI or Apoe4
alone and in the absence of both risk factors, females and males having both TBI history and Apoe4 had the earliest age of AD diagnosis
(M DiffYears=females ≥2.8; males ≥2.5); however, this interaction was
non-significant (p≥.26).
Conclusions: History of self-reported TBI and presence of Apoe4 were
independently associated with earlier diagnosis of AD in both females
and males. However, an interaction between these two risk factors was
not observed regardless of sex. These findings suggest TBI and Apoe4
may be associated with an earlier expression of cognitive decline that is
additive but not synergistic.

D.A. NATION, J.K. HO & B. YEW. Older Adults Taking AT1Receptor Blockers Exhibit Reduced Cerebral Amyloid Retention
and Progression to Dementia.
Objective: Evidence suggests that angiotensin II AT1-receptor blockers
(ARBs) may be protective against dementia, and studies in transgenic
animals indicate that this may be due to improved amyloid-β (Aβ)
clearance. We investigated whether taking ARBs was associated with
an attenuation of age-related increases in cerebral Aβ retention, and
reduced progression to dementia.
Participants and Methods: Eight hundred seventy-one stroke-free
and dementia-free older adults from the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) study underwent baseline lumbar puncture,
and a subgroup (n=124) underwent 12 and 24 month follow-up lumbar
puncture. Participants were followed at variable intervals for clinical
progression to dementia. Linear mixed models and ANCOVA compared
ARBs users with those taking other antihypertensives (O-antiHTN) or
no antihypertensives (No-antiHTN) on cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) Aβ
and phosphorylated tau (P-tau) levels. Cox regression and chi-square
analyses compared groups on progression to dementia.
Results: ARBs users exhibited greater vascular risk and lower educational attainment than the No-antiHTN group. Longitudinal analyses
indicated higher CSF Aβ and lower P-tau in ARBs users versus other
groups. Cross-sectional analyses revealed age-related decreases in CSF
Aβ in other groups but not ARBs users. ARBs users were less likely to
progress to dementia and showed reduced rate of progression relative
to the No-antiHTN group.
Conclusions: Patients taking ARBs showed an attenuation of age-related decreases in CSF Aβ, a finding that is consistent with studies
done in transgenic animals. These findings may partly explain why
ARBs users show reduced progression to dementia despite their lower
educational attainment and greater vascular risk burden.

Depression with Spiritual Delusions as a Manifestation of EarlyOnset Alzheimer’s Disease: A Case Report.
Objective: Major depressive disorder (MDD) with psychotic features is
a distinct type of depressive illness in which mood disturbance is accompanied by either delusions, hallucinations, or both. Psychotic features
can also be seen in delirium and dementia. We describe a Latino woman
with a long-standing history of depression who initially presented with
spiritual delusions and was later diagnosed with early-onset Alzheimer’s
disease (EOAD). This case is remarkable for several reasons; While

241
psychotic features may be present years after dementia diagnosis, they
are very uncommon in preclinical EOAD; Spiritual delusions can be
overlooked when considering spirituality in Latino patients; A literature
review revealed no previous reports of MDD with psychotic features
preceding EOAD.
Participants and Methods: A 53-year-old right-handed Latino woman
with medical history of migraines, sleep apnea and depression presented
to the hospital with complaints of cognitive impairment. Patient’s family
described changes in memory, word-finding and behavior (acting on a
belief that her dead parents were living with her). Her ability to independently execute activities of daily living had progressively declined.
In the context of her depression, they noticed a significant worsening of
her mood in the past year.
Results: Further evaluation revealed a paternal family history of EOAD.
She was diagnosed with depression with psychotic features in light of
her fixed delusion. Neuropsychological evaluation revealed impairment
across all cognitive domains and severe depression. Her MMSE score
was 22/30. She was diagnosed with probable dementia and referred
to a behavioral neurology clinic where CSF biomarkers were highly
consistent with AD.
Conclusions: This case illustrates the need to consider EOAD in the
differential diagnosis of depression with psychotic features in individuals with family history of dementia. Early diagnosis of dementia can
improve treatment and prognosis of dementia. Research on this topic
is recommended.

for Alzheimer’s Disease.
Objective: Recognition memory is often evaluated in neuropsychological assessments to distinguish encoding from retrieval impairments, and
it is relatively preserved in normal cognitive aging. Alzheimer’s disease

is also useful in distinguishing AD from normal aging.

(hits minus false alarms) on the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test
were converted to standardized scores based on the performance of the
normal controls.
Results: The sample included 225 individuals with normal cognition
(mean age=76.1 years), and 193 individuals with AD (mean age=74.5).
Seventy five percent of the AD patients were impaired in recognition
memory compared to only 7% of the controls, p<.001. Using a cut score
of z=-2.0 SDs, the sensitivity of recognition memory performance to
distinguish AD from normal cognition was 75%, while the specificity
was 93%. Positive predictive value was 90% and negative predictive
value was 81%. There was a significant correlation (p<.05) for the AD
patients between poorer performance on the recognition memory test
and lower left temporal lobe volume.
Conclusions: Recognition memory performance appears to be a good
cognitive biomarker for Alzheimer’s disease.

& M. HARRINGTON. The Association between Executive Function
and Lipid Levels in the CSF of Individuals with Pre-symptomatic
Alzheimer’s Pathology.
Objective: Ceramide and sphingomyelin are lipid components of myelin sheaths and play an integral role in processing amyloid precursor
protein and removal of β-amyloid and tau. We hypothesize that an

242
earlier change in executive function is associated with changes in these
lipid levels in the CSF of individuals with pre-symptomatic Alzheimer’s
pathology.
Participants and Methods: The study included 36 cognitively healthy
participants with normal levels of β-amyloid and tau (CH-NAT) in their
CSF and 34 cognitively healthy participants with pathological levels of
β-amyloid and tau (CH-PAT) in their CSF (pre-symptomatic Alzheimer’s pathology group).The participants’ neuropsychological battery
included the Stroop Color-Word Interference Test and also had 20 mL
of lumbar CSF collected close to the time of assessment.
Results: Results show a significant difference in levels of sphingomyelin
(p = .04) and in the ratio of levels of ceramide to sphingomyelin (p =
.03) between the two groups. The groups significantly moderated the
relationship between lipid levels and executive function. The CH-PAT
group’s levels of ceramide (p < .05) and the ratio of levels of ceramide
to sphingomyelin (p < .01) were positively associated with executive
function and levels of sphingomyelin (p < .05) were negatively associated with executive function. The association in the CH-PAT group
was significantly larger in levels of ceramide (p < .05) and the ratio of
levels of ceramide to sphingomyelin (p < .05) than it was with levels of
sphingomyelin alone.
Conclusions: Significantly increased levels of sphingomyelin and the
ratio of ceramide to sphingomyelin in the CSF of the CH-PAT group,
when compared to the CH-NAT group, suggests a role of these lipids
in amyloid processing. Positive association of ceramide and the ratio of
ceramide to sphingomyelin in the CH-PAT group with executive function and negative association of sphingomyelin with executive function
suggests that changes in membrane composition influence neuropsychological measures.

M.K. COLVIN, M. DALY, A. LAFFER, S. MANCUSO &
J.C. SHERMAN. An investigation into cognitive and test factors
that impact performance on the Free and Cued Recall Test among
patients with MCI and Dementia.
Objective: The Free and Cued (F & C) Recall task is highly sensitive
in predicting dementia, particularly of the Alzheimer’s type. While this
test has great value in dementia diagnosis, given the task’s multiple demands, including naming, appreciation of semantic categories, learning,
as well as retrieval of the pictured objects, we asked whether performance is affected by naming and learning success within the task, the
degree to which item prototypicality (i.e., goodness of example) impacts
performance and how well performance correlates with performance on
other semantic access and memory tasks.
Participants and Methods: We administered the F & C Recall test as
part of a larger neuropsychological battery to 137 patients including
42 with MCI, amnestic type, 53 with MCI, non-amnestic type, 19 with
possible and probable AD and 23 with other dementias. We recorded
patients’ naming and initial encoding success during the learning trial.
Results: Our findings replicate previous studies indicating a particular
sensitivity of this task to amnestic forms of MCI and dementia. We
found that training success, both naming and initial encoding, predicted
free recall while initial encoding predicted free and cued performance.
Regression analyses indicate that patients’ performance on the free
recall trial was predicted by performance on memory measures (LM
I and LMII) while delayed verbal memory (LMII) and confrontation
naming (BNT) predicted combined free and cued recall performance.
Patients were significantly better at recalling high than low prototypicality items. Verbal fluency performance (phonemic, category) did not
predict performance.
Conclusions: Our findings suggest that the sensitivity of the F & C
Recall task is best understood when contributions of semantic memory
as well as a decline in associative memory are considered. We discuss
our findings in terms of their relevance in understanding the breakdown

in memory and semantic knowledge in MCI and dementia and the role
that these factors play in this diagnostic test.

Caregiver and clinician impressions of false memory in patients
with Alzheimer’s disease: A questionnaire study.
Objective: Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is characterized by the rapid rate
of forgetting for new information. Patients also commonly exhibit false
memories, and no studies have examined the impact of false memories
in every day life. We examined the frequency with which caregivers
and clinicians observed false memories in patients on several activities
of daily living.
Participants and Methods: 115 caregivers and 178 clinicians were
recruited. Caregivers were family members providing care for a patient
with AD. Clinicians individuals that saw patients in their practice. Participants filled out a questionnaire asking how often patients forgot or
falsely remembered to complete an everyday activity (How often does
your loved one/patient misplace things?; How often does your loved
one/patient know where something is but are mistaken?) There were 5
response options: Often, Sometimes, Rarely, Never, or Don’t Know. We
were interested in the frequency which participants observed forgetting
versus false memory.
Results: Raw scores from each question type were entered into repeated
measures ANOVAs. For caregivers and clinicians, the frequency of forgetting was higher than the frequency of false memory. Forgetting and
false memories were more frequent as disease severity increased.
Conclusions: Caregivers may simply be more aware of the forgetting
of information, and less aware of false memory. Clinicians also observe
more forgetting, as memory assessments commonly examine forgetting rather than false memory. Although forgetting was more frequent
overall, the frequency of false memory was not dramatically lower in
comparison. These results suggest that caregivers and clinicians are
more aware of the incidence of forgetting in patients, though false memories are just as prevalent. Including false memory measures in various
assessments may add to the diagnostic utility in characterizing memory
impairments in patients with AD.

D.F. TATE, S. TASS & E.D. BIGLER. Global Measures of Brain
Volume and Neuropsychological Performance in the Cache
County Memory and Aging Study.
Objective: There have been significant efforts to identify biomarkers
that could be used to diagnose, track treatment effects, and/or explain
functional outcomes in patients with a dementia diagnosis. The purpose of this study was to examine the functional relationships between
volumetric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measures and neuropsychological tests in the Cache County Memory and Aging Legacy dataset
to elucidate the relationship between these variables.
Participants and Methods: Using canonical correlation analysis (CCA)
methods, the relationship between linear combinations of “predictor”
variables (31 brain volume measures) and linear combination of “response” variables (13 neuropsychological tests from the CERAD batter)
was examined in 163 participants with a range of dementia diagnoses
(20 healthy controls, 61 Alzheimer’s disease, 46 vascular dementia,
30 mixed).
Results: Results demonstrated an overall significant model between
the variables (Wilk’s λ=0.0247, p<0.001). Only the first (out of 13
possible) canonical correlation results was significant (r-value=0.79)
explaining 49% of the variance. The second CCA result was not significant, but explained a significant amount of the variance as well
(31%). Visual inspection of the raw/standardized canonical function

Forty Fourth Annual INS Meeting Abstracts
coefficients indicated that global measures of brain integrity (gray/white
matter volume, CSF, ventricle-to-brain ratio) are significantly related to
measures of memory (immediate and delayed logical memory and Benton visual performance) and animal fluency. More specific measures of
brain volume (i.e., hippocampal volume, temporal lobe gyral volumes)
were not found to be related using the CCA methods.
Conclusions: These results emphasize the importance of global brain
volume measures in predicting cognitive performance in dementia
patients. The global aspects of these structural changes predictive of
outcome imply failure in multi-system or whole brain networks that
subserve cognition. The clinical application of these findings will be
addressed.

Detecting response to Cholinergic treatment in AD after 6 week
double-blind placebo controlled trial: sensitivity of attentional
measures on accuracy, fatigue and variability.
Objective: Cholinesterase inhibitors are standard treatments of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). The standard industry efficacy measure aggregates
multiple cognitive areas, leading to poor sensitivity. As acetylcholine
modulates attention, we hypothesized that treatment effects could be
detected using demanding attention tasks within ≈6 weeks, while global
or other domain-specific cognitive measures would not.
Participants and Methods: 23 participants newly diagnosed with AD
were in a longitudinal randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial.
After baseline (T1), participants were randomized (Drug [donepezil
5mg] =12; Placebo=11), and retested after ≈6 weeks (T2). Global function, specific domains (memory, language, visuospatial, and executive
function) and 3 load-varying attention tasks (Simple Detection, Covert
Orienting, and Attentional Blink) were assessed. Measures included
speed and variability using reaction time (RT) and Standard Deviation
(SD), orienting using costs and benefits, fatigue using RT difference
across multiple trial blocks, and accuracy of top-down identification
under varied load. Treatment effects were measured with repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Wilcoxon signed-rank tests.
Results: Variability: By T2, only the Drug group decreased variability at
high load (T1–T2, z=-2.04, p=.04, d=.64). Fatigue: At T2, the Placebo
group slowed overall RT across blocks on detection (Block1-2, z=-2.22,
p=.03, d=.53) and orienting (Block1-5, z=-2.93, p=.00, d=.95). Accuracy: the Placebo group worsened from 62% (T1) to 37% (T2), z=-2.20,
p=.03, d=.98. No other measures showed treatment effects.
Conclusions: Supporting our hypothesis, our attention tasks detected
cholinergic augmentation in AD after only ≈6 weeks: the Drug group
improved variability while the Placebo group worsened accuracy and
increased fatigue. Global and domain-specific measures failed to detect
change. Attention, measured by accuracy, variability and fatigue, may
be valuable to assess efficacy of cholinergic treatment.

Attentional Blink predicts treatment response to cholinesterase
inhibitors in patients with AD: accuracy on a high load top-down
task.
Objective: Developing sensitive tools to detect early response to cholinesterase inhibitors in patients with Alzheimer’s disease (AD) remains
challenging. The Alzheimer’s Disease Assessment Scale-Cognition Subscale (ADAS-Cog) assesses efficacy at 6 months, which confounds treatment response with disease progression, as well as small effect sizes. As

243
acetylcholine modulates attention, we hypothesized that the Attentional
Blink task would be more sensitive and predict treatment response once
steady state is reached (≈6 weeks).
Participants and Methods: 20 participants newly diagnosed with
AD were in a longitudinal trial. After baseline (T1), participants took
daily donepezil (5mg), and retested after ≈6 weeks (T2) and ≈6 months
(T3). Responders (N=9) and non-responders (N=11) were classified by
T3 ADAS-Cog scores. Measures: ADAS-Cog and Attentional Blink, a
top-down task presenting two sequential alphanumeric characters at 5
increasing levels of temporal load (Stimulus Onset Asynchrony [SOA]:
655, 532, 399, 266, or 133 ms). A priori letter or number category cues
prompted which item to report (DV: Accuracy at each SOA). Analyses
comprised two binary logistic regressions: 1) predicting T3 responder
classification using T2 ADAS-Cog and SOA accuracy as IVs; 2) using
significant predictor variables in a new model to assess predictive power.
Results: At T2, two SOAs significantly predicted T3 response (399ms:
β=-20.29, SE=10.47, Exp(B)=.00, p=.01; and 266ms: β=-3.34,
SE=3.30, Exp(B)=.03, p=.04). A model including only significant SOAs
predicted T3 treatment response (Sensitivity=78%, Specificity=82%,
p=.01). Increased accuracy resulted in higher odds to respond to
treatment.
Conclusions: The ability to accurately report an alphanumeric target under high temporal load after 6-weeks cholinergic treatment
significantly predicted industry accepted drug-response classification
at 6-months. This supports that mechanisms of attention are highly
sensitive to cholinergic augmentation, and may be potential identifiers
of treatment response.

Dementia (Non-AD)
M. BERTOUX, C. O’CALLAGHAN, L.C. DE SOUZA, M. SARAZIN,
B. DUBOIS & M. HORNBERGER. Social cognition distinguishes
amnestic behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia from
Alzheimer’s disease.
Objective: Recent studies showed that the diagnostic distinction of behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD) and Alzheimer’s
disease (AD) should no longer rely on the evaluation of memory, as one
out of two bvFTD patients could suffer from a severe episodic amnesia.
During the last decade, social cognition testing has appeared as very
useful to distinguish both diseases at early stages. The aim of this study
was to investigate the ability of a short (<20min) Social cognition &
Emotional Assessment, namely the mini-SEA, to distinguish bvFTD
from AD, regardless of the presence of amnesia.
Participants and Methods: 103 participants, including 38 bvFTD, 35
AD and 30 controls were included. 48% of patients underwent a lumbar
puncture therefore corroborating the initial diagnosis. All underwent
a neuropsychological assessment, including an episodic memory evaluation controlling for executive processing and the mini-SEA, which
include an evaluation of theory-of-mind (Faux-pas) and facial emotion
recognition. bvFTD patients were divided on their memory performance
into amnestic (n=19) and non-amnestic (n=19) subgroups.
Results: bvFTD had lower mini-SEA scores compared to controls and
AD, which had subnormal performances. The mini-SEA was able to distinguish amnestic and non-amnestic bvFTD from AD with respectively
85.1% and 93.9% of accuracy. In contrast, as expected, memory was
only able to classify 69.7% of patients.
Conclusions: Regardless the presence of amnesia, the mini-SEA, a short
social cognition assessment, could accurately distinguish bvFTD from
AD. These findings highlight the necessity to revise the existing neuropsychological diagnosis criterion of bvFTD in order to (1) include social
cognition deficit as a diagnosis marker and (2) withdraw the relative
preservation of episodic memory from the criterion.

A. CARR, P. PAHOLPAK, E. JIMENEZ & M.F. MENDEZ. Perceived
Emotional Intelligence (EI) and Social Behavior Disturbance in
Behavioral Variant Frontotemporal Dementia (bvFTD) and EarlyOnset Alzheimer’s Disease (eAD).
Objective: EI is the ability to recognize emotions, to discriminate feeling
states, and to use these to guide behavior (Salovey et al., 2004). Given
focal social disturbances in these early-onset dementing illnesses, identifying differences in neurocognitive mechanisms linked with EI and
social dysfunction may be helpful to distinguish bvFTD from eAD, and
more broadly examine the role of EI in social behavior.
Participants and Methods: 11 bvFTD patients and 11 eAD patients
completed the EI Scale (Schutte et al., 1998) and a neurocognitive
battery. Caregivers completed the Emotional Blunting Scale (Mendez
et al., 2006) and the Social Dysfunction Scale (Barsuglia et al., 2014).
Participants underwent magnetic resonances scans.
Results: No significant differences amongst groups were observed in
demographics. BvFTD patients reported higher levels of EI compared
to eAD patients (p = .026). BvFTD patients reported higher levels of
emotional regulation (p = .030), increased ability to appraise emotions
in others (p = .011), and social skills than eAD patients (p = .026). Perceived ability to appraise emotions correlated with emotional blunting
behaviors (p = .029), thoughts (p = .022) and social dysfunction (p =
.002). Perceived social skills and ability to utilize emotions correlated
with increased thought blunting (p = .026-.030). EI were inversely
associated with ventromedial prefrontal cortex (r = -.46, p = .016) and
anterior temporal lobe (r = -.40, p = .020). EI correlated with reduced
performances in executive function tasks (r = -.42, p = .013).
Conclusions: BvFTD rated themselves as having higher levels of emotional intelligence than eAD patients. Given the higher levels of social
dysfunction, this likely reflects perceived abilities but not the ability in
real life situation. These findings can clarify the relationship of socioemotional behavioral changes in these dementia syndromes relevant to
an aging population.

A. FEDOR, S. GARCIA & J. GUNSTAD. Cognitive Function does
not Moderate the Relationship Between Subjective and Objective
Physical Activity in Older Adults.
Objective: Cognitive impairment is common in the older adult population and strategies have been developed in an attempt to slow or
reverse this. However, most of these approaches have had marginal,
if any success. Recently, exercise has emerged as a possible way to
improve cognitive functioning in an older adult population. Though
the self-reported accuracy of the amount of exercise in which an older
adult engages has been poor.
Participants and Methods: 60 older adults were recruited as part of a
larger study. Each participant completed a packet of self-report questionnaires, including a measure of physical activity, neuropsychological
measures of memory and other cognitive abilities, and were given an
objective measure of physical fitness.
Results: Over 50% of participants reported performing vigorous intensity physical activity on a weekly basis, and over 40% indicated
performing moderate intensity physical activity weekly. However, objective data revealed participants spent almost of their time immobile.
Correlations between subjective and objective reports of physical activity
were low. Cognitive function did not moderate the relationship between
subjective and objective report of physical activity.
Conclusions: These findings suggest older adults have little insight
into the amount, or intensity, of physical activity they are performing
on a daily basis. Future work is needed to confirm these findings and

M. KORSNES. The Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSE) and the
Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) as a diagnostic screening
tool in an old age psychiatry department.
Objective: In old age psychiatry, it is desirable to quickly predict the
underlying cause of low scores on cognitive screening tests. Excising
screening tools are poor predictors of underlying cause.Can a combination of established screening tools (MMSE and MoCA) give better
prediction in differencing between causes of cognitive decline?The purpose of the study was to investigate if a combination of subtests within
existing screening tools may facilitate better prediction of the cause of
poor performance on cognitive screening tests.
Participants and Methods: 134 patients were tested with MMSE and
MoCA at admission, and later grouped according to diagnosis at discharge. 122 patients fitted into main diagnostic groups, Alzheimer (14),
Other Dementia (13), Schizophrenia (9), Delusional (7), manic (29),
Bipolar (10), MDD (25), GAD (15). Group results on subtests of MMSE/
MoCA were analysed with Anovas corrected for age, sex and education.
Results: The Alzheimer patients had severe problems with all the subtests; several patients could not complete the tests, particularly not the
MoCA test. The “other dementia” group had severe problems with most
subtests, particularly MMSE Orientation, MMSE Figure Drawing, MoCA
Visuo-cognitve test, MoCA Clock drawing, MoCA Abstraction and Orientation. The Schizophrenia group had problems attending to the tests,
and the results are generally not valid for this group. The other groups
showed patterns of poorer and better performances than the average
patients on several subtests of MMSE and MoCA.
Conclusions: The Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSE) and the Montreal
Cognitive Assessment (MOCA) are two diagnostic tests that both are
used for screening purposes when there is a suspicion of cognitive problems. Our preliminary results shows that a combination of MMSE and
MoCa subtests give a better prediction towards a particular diagnosis
than MMSE or MoCA separately.

Neuropsychological Correlates of Dementia Development in
Parkinson’s Disease.
Objective: Cognitive impairments are frequent in Parkinson’s disease
(PD). The cognitive profile observed in PD is often heterogeneous, although some studies have reported that more posterior cognitive deficits are associated with increased risk of dementia. This longitudinal
study examined whether specific cognitive domains in non-demented
PD patients at baseline were associated with increased risk of developing
dementia at follow-up (mean: 4.5 years).
Participants and Methods: Sixty-eight PD patients and 44 healthy
controls underwent a comprehensive neuropsychological assessment at
baseline visit. For each cognitive domain (attention, executive, episodic
memory, and visuospatial), Z-scores were combined into a composite
score. Analyses of covariance, with either age or disease severity as
covariant, were performed to compare the groups on cognitive data,
and Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) curves were computed
to measure the sensitivity and specificity of cognitive domains to predict
dementia outcome in PD.
Results: At follow-up, 18 PD patients developed dementia (PDD) and
50 PD patients remained dementia-free (PDnD). PDD patients scored
markedly lower on all cognitive measures at baseline compared to PDnD
patients and controls. PDnD patients also had poorer scores on attentional and executive functions than controls. Using ROC curves, attention, executive, and visuospatial scores showed the highest sensitivity
(0.83, 0.78, and 0.94, respectively) and specificity (0.89, 0.91, and
0.80, respectively) to identify PDD patients. Episodic memory scores

Forty Fourth Annual INS Meeting Abstracts
showed modest subject-wise classification (sensitivity 0.67; specificity
0.78).
Conclusions: This study shows that attention, executive, and visuospatial measures are sensible early markers of dementia development in PD.
As reported in the litterature, visuospatial abnormalities appeared more
specifically associated with PDD, supporting the notion that posterior
dysfunctions are related to a more rapid cognitive decline in PD.

A. FERNANDO & J. MENDIS. Validation of the Repeatable Battery
for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status for individuals
diagnosed with Dementia.
Objective: The study aimed at assessing the convergent, concurrent
and clinical validity of the RBANS in patients diagnosed with dementia.
Participants and Methods: The reliability of the instrument was determined by assessing internal consistency, test-re-test and inert-rater reliability. Preliminary clinical validity was performed among 40 dementia
patients and 40 normal controls. Convergent validity was established
using the standardized Sinhala Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE).
Concurrent validity was established by assessing patient performance
on the Sinhala version of the RBANS and their functional outcome (i.e.,
employment status). A discriminant function analysis was performed
to assess the extent to which employment status is associated with the
RBANS Sinhala version. Further, a discriminant function analysis was
performed to categorize and distinguish patients from that of normal
controls.
Results: The RBANS demonstrated good internal consistency reliability
for both the patient and control groups and good test-retest & inter-rater
reliability for the patients. Dementia patients performed significantly
worse and showed more marked cognitive impairment than healthy
controls on the Sinhala RBANS. A moderate correlation was evident
between the Sinhala RBANS and the MMSE. It was possible to correctly classify employment status by equal to or more than 87% of the
time by using the RBANS Total score, showing evidence for concurrent
validity. The Sinhala RBANS was capable of classifying patients from
that of controls 93% of the time or more using the RBANS Total score,
and further, showed good patterns of inter-correlations within RBANS
Indexes, supporting evidence for construct validity.
Conclusions: The Sinhala RBANS revealed coherence in identifying
cognitive impairment in dementia patients.

L.A. SCHAEFER & M.A. SLUKA. Vowel Versus Consonant LetterWord Fluency: Differences Between Dementia Types?
Objective: Behforuzi et al. (2013) have shown that initial vowel fluency
in patients with Alzheimer’s disease (AD) was significantly lower than
consonant fluency, when compared to normals and MCI patients. However, there are no studies comparing this between patients of varying dementias. This study examines initial vowel versus consonant letter-word
fluency between patients with subcortical and cortical dementias.
Participants and Methods: A retrospective analysis of outpatients referred for cognitive assessment of dementia (N=27; mean age=75 years,
male=9; female=18) was conducted. All patients had been administered
the Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status
(RBANS) and Letter Fluency (COWA), among other tests. Calculation
of the Randolph Cortical/Subcortical Index (Randolph et al., 1998) was
conducted to confirm cortical and subcortical dementia populations
(subcortical=10; cortical=17). Analysis of variance was performed between groups for F, A, S, total COWA, F/A ratio, S/A ratio, and RBANS
indices. Pearson correlations were performed between RBANS indices
and individual letter fluency by group.
Results: There was no significance between cortical and subcortical
groups on fluency for A (F(1,25)=1.143, p=.295); A was lower for both

245
groups. However, F (F(1,25)=5.090, p=.033) and S (F(1,25)=5.510,
p=.027) were significantly higher in the cortical group, consistent with
prior literature (Herbert et al., 2014). There was a trend for the cortical
group to produce more words across letter (F(1,25)=3.992,p=.057).
There was no significance found for the F/A or S/A ratios. RBANS
Attention Index was significantly lower in the subcortical group
(F(1,25)=7.368,p=.012). Correlations were not significant.
Conclusions: Results of this study indicated that impairment in vowel
fluency (i.e., representing more weakly connected, phonetic-lexical
networks) is not specific for cortical (AD) dementia. Thus, assessment
of vowel fluency in particular may prove to be an early indicator of
dementia in general.

cholesterol affect verbal memory in healthy cognitively asymptomatic
older adults. The goal is to gain more insight into the interplay between
variability in blood flow and cognitive functioning by specifically addressing elevated DBP NBPR and cholesterol levels as potential risk
factors of dementia, and how these affect verbal memory in healthy
older adults.
Participants and Methods: Participants and medical procedures
(uniform clinical assessment, ApoE4 classification) information were
derived from archival data at Huntington Medical Research Institutes
(HMRI). The sample size consisted of 70 participants, 36 participants
were classified as cognitively healthy with normal CSF amyloid/Tau
ratio (CH-NAT), and 34 participants were classified as cognitively
healthy with pathological CSF amyloid/Tau ratio (CH-PAT). The verbal memory score was a composite Z-score consisting of the LM II total
raw score, and the CVLT LDFR corrected raw score.
Results: After controlling for age, gender, education level, and ApoE4
genotype, the linear regression showed a negative correlation between
participant’s DBP and verbal memory such that raised DBP NBPR was
associated with decreased verbal memory scores (F (5, 67) = 6.61, p =
.001). In the overall sample, cholesterol was found to have no significant
association with verbal memory (F (5, 57) = 4.22, p = .77). However,
cholesterol and verbal memory reached near significance in the CH-PAT
clinical group (F (2, 28) = 7.15, p = .01).
Conclusions: As both diastolic and systolic blood pressure (SBP) play
an important role in health and the prevention of dementia, these findings point towards elevated DBP and SBP NBPR as possible preclinical
markers for dementia in healthy older adults. The results demonstrate
how problems with blood pressure regulation may impair memory prior
to symptoms of cognitive decline.

A. BAZINET, J. CONLEY, S. ANDERSON, M. ARBUCKLE,
J.M. LOFTIS & M. HUCKANS. Neuropsychological Performance
of Adults with Active Methamphetamine Dependence Compared
to Adults in Early Remission and Never Users.
Objective: Numerous studies have shown that, relative to never users,
individuals with methamphetamine (MA) dependence have lower cognitive performance in the months following cessation of use, particularly

246
on tests of memory and executive function. Less is known about the
cognitive performance of active MA users, though low doses of MA
have been shown to improve attention and concentration (with users
desiring these effects). Understanding the cognitive impact of active MA
dependence may provide insight into factors that maintain MA addiction
and interfere with intervention and recovery.
Participants and Methods: The Neuropsychological Assessment
Battery (NAB) was used to assess attention, language, memory, spatial abilities, and executive function in individuals currently meeting
DSM-IV criteria for MA dependence (MA-ACTs; n=19; mean # of days
since last use = .63), individuals in early recovery from MA dependence
(MA-REMs; n=40; mean # of days since last use = 120.5; last use >30
days & < 6 months) and never users (CTLs; n=26). Participants in MA
groups did not meet criteria for any other recent substance dependence.
Results: Analysis of variance was used to assess group differences in
age and education corrected NAB standard scores within each domain.
Omnibus tests revealed that groups differed on the domains of memory
and executive function (p<.05) but not attention, language, or spatial
abilities. Post-hoc comparisons indicated that the MA-REMs had worse
memory ability compared to CTLs (p<.01), and worse executive function compared to MA-ACTs (p<.05). MA-ACTs performed similarly to
CTLs on all domains and subtests.
Conclusions: At least some cognitive problems appear and persist
during remission from MA addiction but are not present during active
MA use. Barriers to MA use cessation may, therefore, potentially include
a desire to avoid the cognitive symptoms that may result from remission,
or to self-medicate cognitive difficulties that may have existed prior to
any MA use.

A. PFEFFERBAUM & E.V. SULLIVAN. Differential Impairment
in Prospective and Retrospective Metamemory Monitoring
in Nonamnesic Alcoholism: Evidence toward Mnemonic
Anosognosia.
Objective: Metamemory refers to personal knowledge about one’s own
memory ability with implications for cognitive processes relevant to
monitoring and controlling memory. Monitoring processes can be assessed with prospective measures such as Feeling-Of-Knowing (FOK)
judgments predicting future recognition performance, or retrospective
confidence judgments (RCJ) made on previous memory performance.
Alcoholic patients with amnesic Korsakoff’s Syndrome (KS) show poor
FOK but intact RCJ. The neuropsychological continuum from mild to
moderate deficits in nonamnesic alcoholics (ALC) to amnesic KS raises
the possibility that ALC uncomplicated by clinically-detectable amnesia
may suffer anosognosia for their mild memory deficits. Previously, overestimation of memory capacities was revealed with the FOK measure
in French alcoholics, but retrospective monitoring was not examined.
Participants and Methods: Here 24 ALC and 26 age-matched controls
from the U.S. completed a 3-stage, episodic memory paradigm with
prospective and retrospective monitoring: 1) learning of 48 unrelated
words pairs; 2) cued recall of the second word of a pair and prospective
FOK judgment of future recognition performance; 3) word recognition
task with RCJ. For the FOK task, participants viewed the first word of
each previously-learned word-pair associated with 3 options for judging
the second word: I know, I feel I know, I don’t know. For RCJ, participants assessed their confidence that they did successfully recognize
the correct word.
Results: ALC were less accurate than controls in recognition and in
assessing their future recognition, which was marked by overestimation, but were as accurate as controls on confidence ratings of actual
recognition performance.
Conclusions: This dissociation of impaired FOK with intact RCJ has
been noted in other neurological disorders including Alzheimer’s disease and suggests evidence for a mnemonic anosognosia in nonamnesic

alcoholism that may undermine clinical treatment efforts. Support:

J.J. MAHONEY, A. KALECHSTEIN, S. BAJO, P. ADUEN,
T. NEWTON & R. DE LA GARZA. The Impact of Comorbid
Drug Use and Cocaine Use Patterns on Cognitive Functioning in
Individuals with Cocaine Use Disorders.
Objective: To determine whether comorbid drug use (nicotine, alcohol, and marijuana) impacts cognition in individuals diagnosed with
a cocaine use disorder (CUD) and also whether cocaine use patterns
impact cognitive functioning. It was hypothesized that those individuals
who use other substances comorbidly, as well as those who report more
years, recent, and daily cocaine use, will demonstrate greater cognitive
dysfunction.
Participants and Methods: Recently abstinent cocaine users who concurrently use nicotine (n=17), alcohol (n=15), or marijuana (n=20)
were matched to individuals who only use cocaine. Comparisons were
made on the following measures: Continuous Performance Task–II,
N-Back working memory test, and Hopkins Verbal Learning Task–
Revised. In a separate analysis, recently abstinent cocaine users (N=125)
were divided into tertiles based on cocaine use variables (years, recent
– last 30 days, and daily cocaine use – grams per day) and the highest
and lowest groups were compared using one-way ANOVA.
Results: Cocaine users who concurrently use nicotine, alcohol, or marijuana did not differ from cocaine users alone on any cognitive measures
(all p’s > 0.05). In addition, cocaine users who used for more years
(25.2±0.6 vs. 10.1±0.6 years), had more recent cocaine use over the past
month (26.3±0.5 vs. 6.0±0.6 days), and reported more daily cocaine
use (1.8±0.0 vs. 0.7±0.0 grams) had comparable results to those users
with use patterns of shorter duration, less frequency, and lower daily
intake (p’s > 0.05).
Conclusions: Although it is assumed that use of nicotine, alcohol, and
marijuana may further exacerbate cognitive deficits in individuals with
CUD, the results of the current study did not support that assumption
– at least in this cohort. In addition, while it seems reasonable to infer
that more years of use, greater recent use, and larger amounts of cocaine
used on a daily basis would be risk factors for impaired cognition, our
findings also did not support this.

J.J. MAHONEY, A. KALECHSTEIN, R. SALAS, S. BAJO, P. ADUEN
& R. DE LA GARZA. Cognitive Functioning in Cigarette-Deprived
Smokers.
Objective: To determine the effects of cigarette deprivation (~24 hours)
on cognition and whether specific nicotine withdrawal symptoms correlate with performance on cognitive measures.
Participants and Methods: Cigarette smokers (n=36) were administered a cognitive battery after smoking ad libitum (Day 1) and then
following cigarette deprivation (Day 2, confirmed using carbon monoxide levels). The cognitive battery included the Continuous Performance Task–II (CPT-II), N-Back working memory test, and Hopkins
Verbal Learning Task–Revised. Participants were also administered
the Wisconsin Smoking Withdrawal Scale (WSWS) to assess nicotine
withdrawal symptoms.
Results: Self-reported hours since last cigarette were significantly
greater on Day 2 than Day 1 (26.9±7.2 vs. 1.3±0.8; p < .0001) and exhaled breath CO was significantly lower on Day 2 versus Day 1 (3.3±1.8
vs. 16.0±6.6 ppm; p < .0001). Following cigarette deprivation, participants displayed worsened delayed recall on the HVLT-R (p=0.007).
There were no significant differences on any other cognitive measures
between conditions. The craving subscale of the WSWS was positively
correlated with the number of commission errors on the CPT-II during

Forty Fourth Annual INS Meeting Abstracts
the smoking as usual (r=.481, p=0.006) and following cigarette deprivation (r=.411, p=0.02) conditions (i.e. higher craving scores were associated with lower levels of inhibitory control).
Conclusions: Overall, the difference in performance on the cognitive
measures between the smoking as usual and cigarette deprivation conditions was minimal, contradictory to previous findings noting deprivation related deficits in attention, inhibitory control, reaction time, and
working memory. One potential explanation may be that the cognitive
withdrawal effects may resolve within the 24 hour timeframe. These
findings question the impact nicotine withdrawal has on cognition and
whether withdrawal effects earlier in the cigarette deprivation process
contribute to neurocognitive decrements.

K. MULHAUSER, C. WHITE, R. VAN PATTEN, T. MARALDO,
M.R. FARNEY & J. WEINSTOCK. Abstinence-based Changes
in Neurological Functioning During Residential Treatment for
Alcohol and Cocaine Use Disorders.
Objective: Heavy use of alcohol and cocaine is associated with neuropsychological deficits in domains such as attention, memory, and
executive functions (EFs). Although the literature is mixed, cognitive
abilities tend to improve secondary to extended abstinence. The present
study evaluated changes in neuropsychological status over a brief, 10day period of sustained abstinence early in residential treatment for
substance use disorders (SUD). We hypothesized that (a) neuropsychological deficits would be evident at baseline and (b) that participants
would demonstrate differential improvement in EFs relative to other
cognitive abilities.
Participants and Methods: Participants (N=18) were evaluated after detoxification and upon admission to a hospital-based residential
treatment program for SUD and reevaluated prior to discharge, approximately 10 days later. Neuropsychological domains of memory,
visuospatial abilities, attention, language, and EFs were assessed. Our
primary analysis included a paired t-test comparing results at T1 and T2
for each domain. Covariates, such as addiction severity and substance
use frequency/intensity were also evaluated.
Results: At baseline, 83% of participants demonstrated Borderline or
Impaired functioning (<9th percentile) in one or more domains of neuropsychological functioning, with the median participant impaired in
three domains. Contrary to our second hypothesis, results demonstrated
statistically significant functional improvements in the areas of immediate memory and language ability, but not in other domains evaluated.
Conclusions: These findings contribute to our understanding of early
abstinence-based changes in neuropsychological functioning. Notably,
domains of immediate memory and language abilities, but not EFs,
showed early sensitivity to abstinence-based improvements. Other domains may require longer durations of abstinence to improve. These
findings suggest important clinical implications for residential treatment
effectiveness during the initial stages of recovery from SUD.

Effects of Cannabis Use on Neurocognition among Persons Living
with HIV: Preliminary Observations.
Objective: Most US states with “medical marijuana” laws include HIV
as a qualifying condition. Both HIV and cannabis use are independently
associated with neurocognitive deficits; however, research on how cannabis use may affect neurocognition among persons living with HIV
is lacking.
Participants and Methods: Adult participants in our study were stratified into one of four groups based on HIV-serostatus and cannabis (CB)
use history: HIV+/CB+ (n = 28); HIV+/CB- (n = 47); HIV-/CB+ (n =
55); HIV-/CB- (n = 67). Exclusion criteria were history of significant

247
neurological, psychiatric, and developmental disorders; hepatitis C; and
recent, significant use of any substance (with the exception of cannabis
among the CB+ groups). CB+ participants were recent cannabis users
with a history of regular use. Group status was an independent variable
in all analyses; whereas average neurocognitive performance for each
of the five domains (Processing speed, Learning, Memory, Motor, and
Executive) and average overall performance were dependent variables
in separate ANOVAs. Age, estimated IQ, and education were entered as
covariates in all analyses due to significant between-group differences
(p < .05).
Results: Age and estimated IQ were significant predictors in most models. No significant between group-differences emerged for any neurocognitive domain (p-values > .16). Exploratory analyses of individual
test scores revealed statistically significant between-group differences
only for the Iowa Gambling Task (IGT), with the HIV+/CB- group
performing more poorly than the HIV-/CB- group (p = .04).
Conclusions: We found little evidence for between group differences
among a relatively healthy sample of individuals stratified on HIV-serostatus and cannabis use history. These preliminary findings must
be interpreted cautiously due to small sample sizes, but suggest that
cannabis-associated neurocognitive deficits among individuals with
HIV may be modest. Supported by NIDA R01 DA031176 and R01

Decision-Making and Cannabis Use Interact to Predict Risky
Sexual Behavior.
Objective: Risky sexual behavior (RSB) and substance use are related
and common among teens. However, little is known about how cannabis use (CU) may influence RSB. Among young adults, CU and decision-making (DM) performance predict RSB. This study is the first to
examine how CU and DM influence RSB among teens.
Participants and Methods: Participants are 195, 14-17 year olds,
screened to ensure that a majority are cannabis users. Exclusion criteria
include significant neurological, psychiatric, or developmental disorders. DM was measured with three computerized tasks: two assessed
DM under specified risk (Cups Task [CT] and Game of Dice Task
[GDT]) and one assessed DM under ambiguous risk (Iowa Gambling
Task [IGT]). RSB was assessed with the total score on the Risky Sexual
Behavior Questionnaire (RSBQ). Amount of lifetime CU, DM performance, and their interaction were used to predict RSB using multiple
linear regression.
Results: Specifically, when using the IGT, only amount of CU predicted RSB, β = .278, p < .01. Significant interactions with CU were
observed for GDT and CT (p = .03 and p < .01, respectively). Simple
slope analyses revealed that more CU predicted more RSB, when GDT
performance was average, β = .31, p < .01, and below average, β = .48,
p < .01. Similarly, more CU predicted more RSB, when CT performance
was average, β = .27, p < .01 and below average, β = .50, p < .01. No
significant relationships between CU and RSB were observed when DM
was above average.
Conclusions: Below average DM performance under conditions of specific risk contributed to a stronger relationship between CU and RSB.
In contrast with young adults, there was no significant interaction when
DM was assessed under conditions of ambiguous risk. The contrary
findings between young adults and teens may be due to different stages
of cognitive development; perhaps DM in ambiguous situations requires complex DM abilities and therefore is more difficult for all teens.
Strengthening DM abilities in cannabis using teens may reduce RSB.

Adolescence: Relations with Age, Sex, Alcohol Drinking, and
Organizational Strategy.
Objective: During adolescence, cognitive processes of visuospatial construction, memory, planning, and organization are maturing. Because
these functions are affected by alcohol dependence, we asked whether
moderate alcohol use during adolescence interacts with sex and visuospatial organizational skills.
Participants and Methods: Participants were boys (337 NO/LOW
drinkers; 64 exceeding drinking criteria, EDC) and girls (343 NO/LOW;
74 EDC), age 12-21 years, from the National Consortium on Alcohol &
Neurodevelopment in Adolescence (NCANDA), a multi-site longitudinal study on the effects of alcohol exposure on brain development. All
completed the Rey-Osterrieth Complex Figure Test, which measured
visuospatial construction (figure copy) and episodic memory (immediate
and delayed recall). Pen-switching every 30 sec tracked organizational
strategy, scored as holistic or piecemeal.
Results: Simple effects of sex and alcohol use on copy and recall tasks
were not significant. Copy and recall scores were higher in older than
younger NO/LOW boys and girls. A significant interaction of sex and
copy strategy in the NO/LOW drinkers indicated that girls using a
holistic strategy were more accurate in figure copy than those using
a piecemeal strategy; copy accuracy was not related to strategy in the
boys. Unlike NO/LOW, EDC girls’ and boys’ copy and recall scores did
not show an age effect. Girls but not boys in the EDC group benefited
from holistic strategy in figure recall. EDC girls with piecemeal strategy had the poorest recall scores. Results endured on reanalysis using
demographically-matched samples.
Conclusions: NO/LOW and EDC groups exhibited performance differences with respect to age, sex, and use of organizational strategy to
augment construction and recall accuracy of visuospatial information.
Whether these differences pre-dated onset of drinking or resulted from it
remains to be determined. Support: AA021697, AA021695, AA021692,

P.A. JANULEWICZ & L. LONDON. Herbicide Exposure and Brain
Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) in South African Farmers.
Objective: To investigate the association between pesticide exposure
and MRI brain volumes.
Participants and Methods: Twenty male farmers (mean age 48 ± 9
years) from the Western Cape, South Africa with self-reported past
exposure to organophosphate (OP) insecticides and herbicides (HBs)
during the past 5 year period. Mean education was 7 ± 3 years of schooling, equal to Grade 6 in South Africa. All farmers underwent high
resolution structural T1-weighted multi-echo magnetization-prepared
rapid gradient echo (MEMPRAGE) neuroimaging on a 3T Siemens Allegra MRI scanner. Images were processed semi-automatically using
FreeSurfer software. Comparisons between farmers with and without
self-reported OP and HB exposure were conducted using SPSS software.
Results: Of the 20 subjects, 7 reported OP exposure, 8 HB exposure,
1 both OP and HB exposure, 1 fungicide (sulphur) exposure only, and
3 no pesticide exposure. HBs included Gramoxone (Paraquat dichloride), Glyphosate (Potassium salt), Simazine (2-Chloro-4, 6 bis(ethylamino)-s-triazine), and Mamba (Glyphosate isopropylamine salt). The
HB-exposed farmers were on average 10.4 years older (p=0.005) and
had 3.2 years less education (p=0.02) than the HB-unexposed farmers.
Brain volumes of total gray and white matter, subcortical gray matter,
hippocampus, amygdala, caudate, putamen, pallidum, and nucleus
accumbens were lower among HB-exposed farmers. ANCOVAs controlling for age and education showed that the volumes of left accumbens

(p=0.03) and total white matter (p=0.04) were significantly lower in
HB-exposed farmers. Analyses controlling for age, education and intracranial volume showed that total white matter volume was significantly
smaller in the HB group (p=0.02).
Conclusions: Self-reported herbicide exposure in the past 5 years appears to be associated with smaller white matter brain volumes in South
African farmers in this pilot study. Larger confirmatory studies using
biomarker-based exposure data will help further clarify these initial
findings.

A. TIMKO, D. AASE & N. PLISKIN. Psychiatric Symptom Clusters
are Associated with Social Perception Task Performance among
Individuals with Alcohol Use Disorder.
Objective: Deficits in social perception among alcohol users appear
to persist with abstinence and are associated with treatment outcomes
(Charlet et al., 2014; Foisy et al., 2007). Deficits in complex emotion
recognition and social perception have also been observed among individuals with cognitive symptoms of depression (Lee, et al., 2005) and
anxiety disorders (Plana, et al., 2014), respectively. However, prior
studies exploring if social perception performance is associated with
psychiatric symptoms in alcohol users are limited, and have not explored
specific psychiatric symptom clusters. The present study measured depressive and anxiety symptom clusters and social perception performance in alcohol users during early alcohol abstinence. We hypothesized
that cognitive symptoms of depression and anxiety would be negatively
associated with performance on social perception tasks.
Participants and Methods: .Subjects were 30 patients (10 women, 20
men) participating in an inpatient treatment program for alcohol use
disorder. Subjects were interviewed and administered a brief cognitive
battery that included a Social Perception task. The sample was divided
into two groups, those with intact (n=22) and impaired (n=8) performance on the Social Perception test.
Results: Both affective/somatic and cognitive subscales of the BDI,
along with overall depression scores, were significantly elevated among
individuals with impaired performance on the Social Perception task.
Affective/somatic symptoms of anxiety were also higher among those
with lower social perception scores, while cognitive symptoms of anxiety
and overall anxiety score did not differ between the two groups.
Conclusions: Findings suggest that social perception deficits among
alcohol users during early abstinence may be associated with both affective/somatic and cognitive symptoms of depression, as well as affective
symptoms of anxiety.

Cognitive Function in Veterans with Comorbid PTSD and Alcohol
Use Disorder.
Objective: Cognitive dysfunction is commonly observed in both Alcohol
Use Disorder (AUD) and Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and is
associated with worse treatment outcome. There is a high concordance
of cigarette smoking in AUD and PTSD, however, few studies examine
the role of smoking and cognition in veterans with these co-occurring
disorders.
Participants and Methods: We assessed 53 veterans (2 female) with
PTSD entering a RCT of topiramate treatment for AUD. Smoking
(sAUD) and non-smoking (nsAUD) veterans were compared on domains of cognition including processing speed, working memory, auditory-verbal learning and recall, cognitive flexibility, cognitive inhibition,
response inhibition, choice inhibition, risk-taking, and decision-making. Generalized linear models were used in all analyses. All primary
cross-sectional models comparing sAUD to nsAUD at study entry included fixed predictors of group (smoker, non-smoker). Secondary

Forty Fourth Annual INS Meeting Abstracts
cross-sectional models investigating smoking severity in sAUD at study
entry included fixed predictors of average cigarettes per week in last 90
days (CPW), average drinks per week in last 90 days (DPW), and the
interaction term of CPW-by-DPW.
Results: Smoking AUD performed significantly worse than nsAUD on
response inhibition [x2(1) = 4.36, p<0.05]. However, sAUD performed
better on tests of working memory [x2(1) = 5.189, p<0.05; x2(1) = 4.04,
p<0.05] compared to nsAUD. CPW-by-DPW trends were observed for
working memory (p=0.07), auditory-verbal learning (p=0.07) and recall (p=0.09).
Conclusions: Findings suggest that cigarette-smoking veterans presenting for AUD treatment with comorbid PTSD exhibit less inhibition than
non-smokers. Although smokers performed better in working memory
than non-smokers, smoking and drinking may have a negative synergistic effect on working memory, auditory-verbal learning and recall.
Interventions targeting these domains may be particularly beneficial for
cigarette-smoking veterans with AUD and PTSD.

N.E. WRIGHT, D. SCERPELLA & K. LISDAHL. Young Adult
Marijuana Use and Gender Effects on Frontolimbic Function:
Depression, Anxiety, Impulsivity, and Executive Dysfunction.
Objective: 14.4% of 12th graders report past month marijuana (MJ)
use. Repeated CB1 binding due to THC results in downregulation of the
endocannabinoid system in cortex and limbic regions. Here we examine
the influence of young adult MJ use on anxiety, depression, impulsivity,
and executive dysfunction. The influence of alcohol and gender were
also assessed.
Participants and Methods: 84 subjects (42 MJ, 42 controls) aged 1825 were balanced for gender (39 female). 63% were white. Exclusion
criteria included: MRI contraindications, left handed, comorbid Axis-I
disorders, major medical or neurologic disorders, prenatal issues, or
prenatal alcohol/illicit drug exposure, or excessive other drug use in
lifetime. Subjects completed the Frontal Systems Behavior Scale, BIS/
BAS, State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (State), and BDI-II. Multiple regressions were run to predict anxiety, depressive symptoms, impulsivity,
and executive dysfunction from MJ group status, past year alcohol use,
gender, and MJ*gender interactions, controlling for cotinine.
Results: MJ use predicted increased depressive symptoms (p=.04).
Decreased drive (p=.05), fun-seeking (p=.02), reward responsivity
(p=.006) and BAS Total (p=.09) were predicted by MJ use. Increased
cotinine level predicted increased drive (p=.03) and BAS Total (p=.008)
and marginally predicted increased fun seeking (p=.06). Decreased BIS
Total was predicted by gender (p=.04) and marginally predicted by
alcohol use (p=.09). Disinhibition (p=.06) and anxiety (p=.06) were
marginally predicted by MJ*gender, with female users demonstrating
increased disinhibition and anxiety. Apathy and Executive Dysfunction
were not predicted by any measures.
Conclusions: Depression was greater in MJ group, while components of
impulsivity were decreased. Cotinine level resulted in opposite impulsivity findings. Female MJ users had greater anxiety and disinhibition.
In sum, we found that MJ use in young adults may result in damage
to PFC and limbic regions. Future research is needed to confirm the
neuronal correlates.

G. MIGNAULT GOULET, B. RICH ZENDEL & I. PERETZ. Music
Lessons in Teenagers with Congenital Amusia.
Objective: Congenital amusia is characterized by difficulties processing
music and pitch and can be diagnosed using the MBEA (Peretz et al,
2003). The impairment can be traced to an abnormal P3 brain response
during pitch discrimination tasks and seems to arise from a disruption
of the propagation of information from frontal regions to the auditory
cortex (Peretz et al, 2005; Mignault et al, 2012). The goal of this study
was to determine if 3 months of guitar lessons could improve pitch
discrimination and normalize the associated P3 response in amusics.
Participants and Methods: 18 participants (11-16 years) were tested.
12 of them took part in weekly group guitar lessons for 3 months.
They were categorized as either amusics (below cut-off on the scale
task, N=4), poor pitch discriminators (above cut-off on the scale task,
but with difficulties at the pitch discrimination task, N=4), or control
(N=4). We also included 6 no-contact control participants. Participants
were tested before and after guitar lessons; no-contact controls were
tested at a 3 months interval. Participants performed the scale task in
which they had to discriminate melodies. This was followed by a pitch
discrimination task, where they heard sequences of 5 tones and had to
identify if all tones were identical or if the final tone was shifted in pitch
(by 25 or 200 cents), while EEG was monitored.
Results: There was an improvement on scale task for all participants (p
<0.005). Some amusics and poor pitch discriminators improved their
ability to detect pitch changes at post-test, but the improvement was
not statistically significant as a group. Most critical, after guitar training
there was an emergence of a P3 response to the 25 cents pitch change
in amusics.
Conclusions: Pitch discrimination may be ameliorated by music lessons
in people with pitch processing difficulties. The emergence of a P3 brain
response to small pitch change in amusics after 3 months of music lessons may be indicative of neural plasticity that precedes improvement
in task performance.

Memory Functions
D.M. O’ SHEA, V.M. DOTSON, R.A. FIEO, A. TSAPANOU,
L.B. ZAHODNE & Y. STERN. Older adults with poor self-rated
memory have less depressive symptoms and better delayed
memory performance when perceived self-efficacy is high.
Objective: To investigate whether self-efficacy moderates the association between self-rated memory and depressive symptoms in a large
sample of older adults. The influence of self-efficacy on memory performance was also examined in a subsample of individuals who reported
poor memory.
Participants and Methods: Non-demented participants (n = 3766)
were selected from the 2012 wave of the Health and Retirement Study.
Depressive symptomatology was assessed with the 8-item Center for
Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale. A modified version of the Midlife Developmental Inventory Questionnaire was used as the measure of
self-efficacy. Participants were asked to rate their memory presently on
a five-point scale from Excellent (1) to Poor (5). Immediate memory
and delayed memory (after a five minute interval) were measured by
the number of correct words recalled from a 10-item word list.
Results: Multiple regression analyses revealed that negative ratings of
memory were significantly associated with greater levels of depressive
symptoms, with this effect being greatest in those with low levels of
self-efficacy. Additionally, self-efficacy had a positive association with
delayed but not immediate memory performance in individuals who reported poor memory (N=1196) even after controlling for demographics
and depression.

Conclusions: Self-efficacy moderates the relationship between subjective memory and depressive symptoms. Higher self-efficacy may buffer
against the impact of subjective memory difficulty on one’s mood and
thereby mitigating the effect of depression on objective memory. Interventions should focus on increasing perceived self-efficacy in depressed
individuals reporting poor memory function to potentially minimize
memory impairment.

Poster Symposium 2. Neuropsychological
Assessment & Rehabilitation from Literates to

An Indian Perspective
Organizer: Ashima Nehra

9:00–10:30 a.m.
Cognitive Intervention/Rehabilitation
A. NEHRA, H. KAUR & S. CHOPRA. Neuropsychological
Assessment & Rehabilitation from Literates to Illiterates: An
Indian Perspective.
Symposium Description: With a diverse Indian population having
varied levels of education, culture and socio-economic status it becomes
important to use standardized neuropsychological testing specific to the
population so that we can make correct inferences about their cognitive
status. ‘One size fits all’ policies are not possible in a diverse country like
India. Clinical Neuropsychology is a super- specialization with a strong
focus on evidence-based practice for various neurological conditions.
People with no formal education represent a major proportion of the
world’s population. There is widespread recognition about the role of
literacy and its affect in neuropsychological functioning of the individuals. The impact of literacy is reflected in various spheres of cognitive
functioning. Therefore, the symposium will discuss & unravel (1) the
role and importance of neuropsychological assessment in assessing the
illiterate or low literate population suffering from various neurological
conditions such as stroke, aphasia, dementia, TBI & other neurological
conditions (2) The neuropsychological rehabilitation programs especially developed for the illiterate persons where restorative & compensatory techniques using an eclectic approach are used, depending upon
patient’s level of education. Importance of using evidence based assessment and rehabilitation techniques based on national & international
literature will be highlighted focusing on case specific interventions in
dealing with the illiterate or low literate population along with highly
educated patients which would strengthen the need for more culture
fair tests for assessing neuropsychological functioning and also culture
fair rehabilitative techniques, thereby helping in planning better rehabilitative programs for improved quality of life of patient populations
worldwide.

A. NEHRA, H. KAUR & S. CHOPRA. Neuropsychological
Assessment in India: Impact of Education Revolution.
Introduction: Although lifespan changes in cognitive performance and
Flynn Effect (FE) have both been well documented, there has been little
scientific focus to date on the net effect of these forces on cognition at
the population level. Performance on non-verbal tests such as copying

figures, drawing maps or listening to tones can be significantly influence by the individual’s culture. Arguments against the use of some
current neuropsychological non-verbal instruments, procedures, and
norms in the assessment of diverse educational and cultural groups are
discussed. The present objective is to see the evidence of FE in cognitive
functioning in India. Methodology: Widely used test for memory is the
Post Graduate Institute Memory Scale (PGI-MS) developed in 1976 to
assess ten domains of memory which can also be used for illiterates.
From a community setting, a normative sample of 305 consenting individuals without any previous medical history of psychiatric or neurological disorders constituted our cross-sectional study design. People with
0-5, 6-9 and more than 10 years of education matching the earlier age
range i.e. from 20 to 69 years were evaluated. Results: In 0-5 years of
education FE is seen in recent memory, temporal sequencing, delayed
& immediate recall. In 6- 9 years of education FE is seen in attention,
remote & recent memory, delayed & immediate recall, new learning
ability & visual retention. More than 10 years of education FE is seen in
attention, delayed & immediate recall. Across different education levels
such significant changes are seen in different age ranges. The cognitive
abilities for people between 20-69 years, on the basis of previous norms
are an underestimate of their present abilities. Present generation with
0-5 and 6-9 years of education perform better in their cognitive abilities
as compared to those assessed in 1976. Conclusion: Education influences
the cognitive functioning and therefore FE needs to be assessed not only
in cognitive functioning but also in IQ for the developing nations like
India. Neuropsychological tests with updated norms should be used for
clinical & research purposes so that they do not lead to a misdiagnosis
while assessing memory complaints.

A. NEHRA, H. KAUR & S. CHOPRA. Development & Effectiveness
of a Home Based Neuropsychological Rehabilitation Program for
Patients Suffering from Aphasia.
Introduction: Aphasia is the most striking cognitive sequels of stroke
and other neurological conditions. Neuropsychological rehabilitation
(NR) ameliorates cognitive, emotional, psychosocial & behavioral deficits caused by an insult to the brain. Being a large country with large
population, India presents endless varieties of physical features and
cultural patterns. India not only possesses racial diversity but also linguistic diversity with more than 400 languages is spoken. Therefore, its
rehabilitation also becomes challenging. An attempt is made to synthesize these different models into a comprehensive model of NR.
Methodology: 22 patients suffering from post stroke aphasia were recruited in an ongoing randomized controlled clinical trial with 11 in the
Treatment As Usual (TAU) and 11 in the Treatment Group (TG) using
block randomization. Pre-Post Neuropsychological assessment included
Indian Aphasia Battery (IAB), Color Trail Test 1 (CTT1) & 2 (CTT2),
Visual N Back, Stroke Specific Quality of Life (SSQOL) and Stroke
Aphasia Depression Questionnaire (SADQ). An 8 week home based
neuropsychological program was developed with tasks for language and
cognitive remediation. As NR techniques from the West can’t be blindly
adapted for use in a diverse country like India. The designed tasks had
no influence of age and education. Post assessment was done after 2
months from the baseline assessment. Results: Wilcoxon sign rank test
revealed that the neuropsychological assessment of TG post NR shows a
marked improvement in the scores of the IAB as compared to the TAU.
The scores of CTT1, SSQOL and SADQ also showed improvement in the
TG as compared to the TAU. Conclusions: A home based NR programme
can help in ameliorating the language as well as cognitive deficits in
patients suffering aphasia & can come as aid in developing countries
where it becomes difficult for patients for routine travel to the hospital
due to financial constraints.

A. NEHRA, H. KAUR & S. CHOPRA. Cognitive Rehabilitation of
Individuals after Traumatic Brain Injury Using an Eclectic Literacy
and Culture Free Intervention Program.
Introduction: It is estimated that there are nearly 1.5 to 2 million survivors of Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) in India. TBI can lead to cognitive impairments and persistent Post Concussive Symptoms (PCS).
The effectiveness of Neuropsychological Rehabilitation (NR) post TBI is
well documented and established, but there is a paucity of literacy and
cost effective cognitive retraining interventions for developing nations
which can be used as home-based retraining interventions. Methodology: Thirty four consenting individuals between 18-45 years, educated
from 0-17 years, within one month of Mild/Moderate TBI; with cognitive
complaints and/or PCS, were randomized to the control or the intervention group. They were evaluated using standardized neuropsychological
tools for episodic memory, recent memory, working memory, focussed
attention, delayed recall, short term verbal memory, paired associate
learning, new learning, visual memory, recognition, verbal fluency, perceptuo-motor functioning, anxiety, depression, PCS and Quality of Life
(QOL). The 6-week, home-based NR included cognitive retraining for
focussed and divided attention; short term and long term visual memory;
visuo-spatial and planning ability; and relaxation techniques.
Results: Within group analysis showed improvement in all domains in
both groups. There were significant improvements in the intervention
group as compared to the control after 6 weeks, in episodic memory
(p =0.030); working memory (p=0.016); short term verbal memory
(p=0.007); paired associate learning (p=0.050); new learning, anxiety
(p=0.007); depression (p=0.032); PCS (p=0.050); and QOL (0.005).
PCS still persisted in the control group on follow up (p=0.300), which
shows NR was also successful in ameliorating PCS. Conclusions: Frequently used cognitive interventions have been found to be non-reproducible in developing nations like India, as literacy rates can affect
task performance. This intervention can be used with patients with
low education levels or from lower socio-economic status who cannot
afford daily visits to the Neuropsychologist or a tertiary care centre for
Cognitive Remediation.

J. DELUCA & N.D. CHIARAVALLOTI. Cognitive Rehabilitation
in Multiple Sclerosis.
It is now well established that up to 70% of persons with multiple sclerosis (MS) suffer from cognitive impairment (Chiaravalloti & DeLuca,
2008). Such impairments can have a significant impact on everyday
functional activity in persons with MS. The objective of this presentation
is to briefly outline recent research on the effectiveness of cognitive
rehabilitation in persons with MS.
Three recent Cochrane reviews on cognitive rehabilitation (Rosti-Otajavi & Hamalainen, 2011, 2014; das Nair et al, 2012) have yielded
mixed conclusions. Such reviews of cognitive rehabilitation research
have concluded that there is a low level of evidence to support such
rehabilitation at this time in persons with MS, primarily because of the
low number of studies and several methodological problems in design.
However, beyond the Cochrane approach, there is modest support that
behavioral interventions can significantly improve targeted cognitive
processes. This is especially true in the area of learning and memory,
processing speed and executive functions. Recent studies have shown
that cognitive rehabilitation not only improves neuropsychological functioning, but also results in increased functional brain activity on fMRI
and functional connectivity in the brain, as well as improved everyday
life activity and quality of life (e.g., Chiaravalloti et al, 2012, 2013;
Amato et al., 2014; Bonavita et al, 2015; Mattioli et al, 2010). Overall,
the latest research shows that cognitive rehabilitation can be effective
and is ready for clinical application for persons with MS.

N.D. CHIARAVALLOTI. Cognitive Rehabilitation and
Neuroimaging in Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI).
The modified Story Memory Technique© (mSMT) is a behavioral intervention that teaches context and imagery to facilitate learning within
10-sessions over 5 weeks. Substantial efficacy data now exists in support
of the application of the mSMT to the MS population. The currently
presented series of studies was designed to examine the efficacy of the
mSMT in persons with TBI.
In study 1, 69 participants with moderate-severe TBI, 35 in the treatment group and 34 in the placebo control group, were enrolled in a
double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial (RCT). A
baseline neuropsychological assessment was administered, including
questionnaires assessing everyday memory. Repeat assessments were
conducted immediately and six months following treatment. The treatment group demonstrated significant improvement on a prose memory
task relative to the placebo group post-treatment (η2=.064 medium
effect). Similar results were noted on objective measures of everyday
memory, specifically prospective memory (Cohen’s w=.43, medium effect), and family report of disinhibition in daily life (η2=.046, medium
effect). The mSMT was thus concluded to be effective for improving
learning and memory in persons with TBI.
A second study examined changes in cerebral activation on functional
Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) following mSMT treatment in persons with TBI in a subsample of participants enrolled in the larger RCT.
Eighteen individuals with TBI were randomly assigned to treatment
(n =9) or placebo (n = 9) groups. Baseline and follow-up fMRI was
collected during a list-learning task. Significant differences in cerebral

252
activation from before to after treatment were noted in regions belonging
to the default mode network (DMN) and executive control network in
the treatment group only. Results are interpreted in light of these networks. Activation differences between the groups likely reflect increased
use of strategies taught during treatment. This study demonstrates a
significant change in cerebral activation resulting from the mSMT in
a TBI sample. Findings are consistent with previous work in Multiple
Sclerosis. Behavioral interventions can show significant changes in the
brain, validating clinical utility.
Classification of Evidence: Based on widely accepted classification systems for treatment study design, this study provides Class I evidence
that the modified Story Memory Technique© behavioral intervention
improves both objective memory and everyday memory in persons with
TBI over 5 weeks. Thus, this study extends the evidence for efficacy of
the treatment protocol to a sample of persons with TBI.

These effects on social cognition have translated into signficant improvements in functional outcome with regard to social adjustment,
instrumental task performance, and work readiness. The beneficial
effects appear to persist beyond the cessation of treatment. CET is accompanied by longitudinal changes in brain structure and function that
may explain the therapeutic benefits. Several questions remain about
the neurobiological mechanisms underlying CET effects, applicability
of CET in community settings and predictive questions of who may be
the best candidates of this intervention.

N. OJEDA, M. DÍEZ-CIRARDA, N. IBARRETXE-BILBAO &
J. PEÑA. Cognitive, Functional and Brain Changes in Parkinson’s
Disease After Cognitive Remediation.
Parkinson’s disease is a neurodegenerative disease comprising both motor symptoms and cognitive decline. Very few studies have examined
the role of cognitive rehabilitation to reverse those deficits. We design
a study to assess the efficacy of an integrative cognitive rehabilitation
program (REHACOP) to improve cognition, clinical symptoms, and
functional disability of patients with PD, as well as to examine possible
cerebral changes related to them. Forty four PD patients underwent a
neuropsychological assessment, and MRI-fMRI assessment at baseline
and after 3-month treatment. T1-weighted structural and functional
MRI (fMRI) images during a memory paradigm (learning and recognition) were acquired to assess grey matter volume and brain activation.
PD patients were randomized into REHACOP group (n=22) and control
group (n=22). During 3 months REHACOP group received cognitive
rehabilitation program (REHACOP), while control group attained occupational therapy, (same period & frequency). After, REHACOP group
showed statistically significant and clinically meaningful changes in
processing speed, visual memory, theory of mind, functional disability,
and tendency to improvement in verbal memory. In addition, REHACOP group showed increased brain activation during learning fMRI
paradigm in left middle and inferior frontal areas and during recognition
fMRI paradigm in left inferior frontal gyrus and postcentral gyrus. Moreover, compared to control group, REHACOP group at post-treatment
showed increased brain activation during recognition fMRI paradigm
in middle temporal and occipital areas in correlation with improvement
in cognitive functions. Results suggest that an integrative cognitive rehabilitation program in PD can produce not only significant changes in
cognition and functional disability, but also cerebral activation changes.

M. KESHAVAN. Cognitive Rehabilitation and Neuroimaging in
Schizophrenia.
Deficits in social functioning are present early schizophrenia, may persist
despite antipsychotic treatment, and tend to remain stable in severity
or even worsen in subsequent phases of the illness. At the heart of the
functional disability in this illness lies substantive cognitive impairment.
Attention, executive function, verbal memory and social cognition may
each contribute to functional outcome; in particular, social cognition
measures have better predictive value for community functioning. Current pharmacotherapeutic approaches have limited impact on these deficits. Cognitive remediation approaches are being developed based on
the principles of neuroplasticity; one of these is Cognitive Enhancement
Therapy (CET). Recent data from our group has shown efficacy of this
approach in early course schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder.

to Cognitive and Neural Plasticity.
Symposium Description: Elevated cerebrovascular risk factors (e.g.,
high blood pressure, high cholesterol, elevated glucose) contribute to a
host of age-related neurodegenerative conditions including vascular dementia, Alzheimer’s disease, and generalized vascular-related cognitive
decline. The prevalence of diseases such as hypertension, hypercholesterimia, obesity and diabetes has risen sharply in recent years, and even
in preclinical stages these conditions are associated with alterations to
neural integrity and cognition. Despite this fact, while we have learned a
great deal about the effects of individual risk factors, there is less known
about how conjoint risk affects neural integrity, and even less known
about how lifestyle modifications to reduce risk can affect the brain and
cognition. This symposium will discuss the current state of the science
regarding how vascular risk factors impact brain structure and function
in middle and older-aged individuals, using sophisticated neuroimaging
and neuropsychological techniques. Elizabeth Leritz will present data
regarding brain structural and cognitive differences in individuals with
metabolic syndrome, a constellation of at least three co-occurring CV
risk factors. David Salat will present data on how markers of reduced
insulin resistance and kidney function affect white matter integrity,
and will also discuss alternate ways of conceptualizing conjoint risk.
Andreana Haley will present data on how markers of obesity in midlife are associated with reduced neuronal viability, assessed using MR
spectroscopy. Finally, Scott Hayes and Michelle Voss will present data
on how fitness levels impact the relationship between risk and neural
integrity, and will demonstrate the effectiveness of tools such as exercise
to modify the effect on cognition. William Milberg will serve as a discussant emphasizing the importance of considering vascular risk in studies
of aging and of designing studies focusing on intervention and outcome.

Correlates of Conjoint Cerebrovascular Disease Risk.
Introduction: Cardiometabolic syndrome (CMS), a constellation of three
or more co-occurring cerebrovascular disease (CVD) risk factors, is
associated with vascular-related cognitive impairment and dementia,
especially when diagnosed in midlife. Our lab has established that individual CVD risk factors, such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol,
and dysregulated glucose, may have differential effects on neural tissue,

but it is rare for these conditions to exist in isolation. The purpose of
this study was to examine how comorbid CVD risk, defined using NCEP
(Adult Treatment Panel III) CMS criteria, affects neural integrity, indexed via cortical thickness, and cognition.
Methods: Sixty-four middle to older aged adults underwent a battery
of neuropsychological testing that included both standardized and experimental measures covering all cognitive domains. Participants also
underwent a structural brain MRI scan as well as a brief medical evaluation including blood pressure testing as well as a serum blood draw to
extract physiological and metabolic information. Seventeen participants
in the sample were diagnosed with CMS according to NCEP-III criteria.
This group was compared to the non-CMS group on cognitive measures
as well as cortical thickness across the entire cortical mantle.
Results: The non-CMS group demonstrated reduced cortical thickness in
several brain regions, including middle temporal, parietal, occipital and
lateral frontal. Consistent with these findings, this group also demonstrated significantly worse performance on tasks of learning, executive
function, processing speed, and manual dexterity.
Conclusions: These results demonstrate that CMS is associated with
significant alterations to brain structure and cognition. These effects
appear to be more than just an additive effect of individual CVD risk
factors, suggesting that the conjoint risk reflected by CMS may result in
a unique neuroanatomical and neuropsychological profile.

(BDNF) and endothelial function as measured by asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA), an endogenous inhibitor of nitric oxide synthase.
73 volunteers (36 men; 50±6 yrs of age) completed dual energy X ray
absorptiometry (DXA) scan to assess body composition, a blood draw to
measure BDNF and ADMA levels, and a 1H MRS scan of occipitoparietal
grey matter to measure N-acetyl-aspartate (NAA), a marker of neuronal
viability. The contribution of VAT mass and volume to variance in NAA
was estimated using linear regression models, adjusting for age, sex and
markers of chronic inflammation. The roles of neuronal regeneration
and endothelial function in driving the relationship between VAT and
NAA were explored using mediation.
Greater VAT was associated with lower NAA levels (VAT mass beta=0.28, p=0.035; VAT volume beta=-0.28, p=0.035), adjusting for age,
sex, and C-reactive protein. Neither BDNF nor ADMA accounted for
the detected relationships (95%CI BDNF -0.0003 to 0.0011; 95% CI
ADMA -0.0049 to 0.0003).
Greater mass and volume of visceral adipose tissue were related to lower
neuronal viability, a sign of brain vulnerability in otherwise healthy middle-aged adults. These relationships were independent of age, sex, and
inflammation. Thus, abdominal obesity appears to negatively impact
the brain early in life and these effects are not solely due inflammation.
However neither impaired neuronal regeneration nor endothelial dysfunction, as measured by BDNF and ADMA levels, fully accounted for
this relationship. Thus, further research into the mechanisms by which
visceral adiposity exerts deleterious effects on the brain is warranted.

D.H. SALAT. Differential Associations between Systemic Markers
of Disease and White Matter Tissue Health in Middle Aged and
Older Adults.
Age-associated changes in cerebrovascular health impacts brain tissue
integrity. Little is known, however, about how variation in markers of
systemic health may influence the brain and this is particularly true in
individuals with generally good health. We examined 139 individuals
ranging in age from 40 to 86 years old who were physically healthy and
cognitively intact. Eleven markers and five indicators were obtained
from venous blood sampling (total-cholesterol, HDL, LDL, triglyceride,
insulin, fasting glucose, hemoglobin A1C, creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, albumin, total protein, estimated glomerular filtration rate, creatinine clearance rate, insulin-resistance, mean glucose, and cholesterol/
HDL ratio). Five underlying factors explained significant variance in
the blood markers. The first factor (interpreted as insulin/HDL factor
(IHF)) and third factor (interpreted as kidney function factor (KFF))
each showed strong associations with white matter tissue microstructure. These associations differed regionally with the IHF being more
related to the integrity of the deep white matter and projection fiber
systems whereas the KFF was more associated with the periventricular
and watershed white matter regions. Differential segregated associations
with white matter integrity for insulin and HDL levels and serum markers of kidney function may provide information about mechanisms of
brain changes across the lifespan. Future work is needed to determine
whether there is potential for therapeutic modulation of systemic health
to enhance or prevent decline in brain structural integrity. These results
emphasize the need for more focused understanding of the influence of
systemic health and organ function on the brain.

S.M. HAYES. Cognitive and Neural Correlates of Physical Activity
in Aging.
Aging is associated with cognitive and neural decline, although there is
substantial individual variability among older adults. Physical activity
is one factor that may be positively associated with cognition and the
brain. The majority of studies examining cognition and daily physical
activity have used subjective assessments, such as self-report questionnaires that may be subject to omissions and biases. In the current studies, physical activity was objectively assessed using an accelerometer in
young (age 18-31 years) and older (ages 55-82 years) adults. Standardized neuropsychological tests, as well as an experimental face-name relational memory task, were administered to assess executive function and
episodic memory capacities. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) was used to
assess white matter microstructure. Older adults performed more poorly
on tasks of executive function and episodic memory. Physical activity
was positively associated with a composite measure of visual episodic
memory, as well as face-name memory accuracy in older adults. Physical activity was not associated with cognitive performance in younger
adults. DTI revealed a similar pattern, as an age group by physical
activity interaction was observed in multiple white matter regions. The
interaction was driven by a greater positive association between physical
activity and white matter integrity in older adults relative to younger
adults. These results support the notion that physical activity contributes
to cognitive and neural variability among older adults.

M. VOSS. Investigating the Relationships Between Physical
Activity, Exercise, and Fitness with Functional Brain Health in
Older Adults.
Although greater physical activity and cardiorespiratory fitness are
known to delay age-related cognitive decline and decrease risk of Alzheimer’s Disease, there is a lack of understanding of how physical activity
and fitness protect the aging brain. We have previously shown that 1
year of aerobic exercise training enhanced the functional integrity of
brain networks that are susceptible to age-related cognitive decline and
neurodegenerative diseases such as the Default Mode Network (DMN).

In this talk I will present results from two studies that further test the
mechanisms associated with these protective effects of exercise on the
aging brain. The first study tested the concept that there are acute effects of exercise in the same brain systems that are affected by chronic
exercise training. In healthy older adults, we found that 30 minutes of
moderate-intensity aerobic cycling selectively increased functional synchrony among brain regions associated with attention, executive control,
and memory that typically display age-related reductions in their synchrony. In the second study, we examined the independent relationships
between physical activity and fitness with functional brain health among
healthy older adults. We found that cardiorespiratory fitness, but not
physical activity, was related to greater functional connectivity of several
cortical networks associated with age-related decline, and effects were
again strongest in the DMN. Together, our findings support the proposal
that cardiorespiratory fitness is an important factor in moderating the
adverse effects of aging on cognitively and clinically relevant functional
brain networks, and that investigating the acute effects of exercise that
would increase fitness levels may accelerate discoveries of the mechanisms associated with physical exercise as a stimulus for enhanced brain
health in aging adults.

L. ARNOLD & H. TAYLOR. Effects of Attention-Deficit/
Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) Treatment and Intensive Reading
Instruction for Children with Comorbid ADHD and Significant
Word Reading Difficulties (RD).
Objective: This study compared ADHD treatment alone, RD treatment alone, and their combination for children with both ADHD and
RD. Hypotheses were: (a) reading outcomes would be better with RD
treatment than with ADHD treatment; (b) attention outcomes would be
better with ADHD treatment than with RD treatment; and (c) combined
treatment would result in better outcomes in both domains than either
disorder-specific treatment.
Participants and Methods: Children (n=215) in grades 2-5 met
DSM-IV criteria for ADHD and had significant word reading or decoding deficits. Children were randomized to receive 16 weeks of (a) ADHD
treatment (carefully-managed medication + parent training), (b) RD
treatment (intensive phonologically-based reading instruction), or (c)
Combined ADHD + RD treatment. Outcomes were measures of word
reading and phonological decoding and parent and teacher attention
ratings. Analyses utilized a mixed models covariate-adjusted gain score
approach where post-test is regressed onto pretest and the other predictors in the model (e.g., treatment group).
Results: Attention outcomes were significantly better in the ADHD
treatment and Combined treatment groups relative to RD treatment
alone; the ADHD and Combined groups did not differ. Word reading and decoding outcomes were significantly better in both the RD
treatment and Combined treatment groups relative to ADHD treatment
alone; the RD and Combined groups did not differ.
Conclusions: Children with comorbid ADHD and RD benefit from
specific treatment of each disorder. ADHD treatment is associated with
significantly more improvement in inattentive symptoms than RD treatment, and intensive reading instruction is associated with significantly
better word reading and decoding outcomes than ADHD treatment.
Combining the treatments allows treating both disorders simultaneously
but does not appear to have additive value for either disorder. This research was supported by grant 1R01 HD060617-01 from the National
Institute of Child Health and Human Development.

Cognitive Functioning in Adolescent and Young Adult Cannabis
Users: Results from a Large Community-Based Sample.
Objective: Cannabis use by adolescents and young adults has been associated with alterations in cognitive functioning, although findings have
been somewhat inconsistent and primarily based on users seeking treatment and individuals responding to research advertisements. Moreover,
few studies have examined cognition in less frequent cannabis users.
Participants and Methods: We examined associations between cannabis use and cognitive functioning using the Penn Computerized Neurocognitive Battery (CNB) in a community-based sample of 4,961 youths,
ages 14-21, from the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort. Participants were classified into cannabis Non-Users (n=3,765), Occasional
Users (n=960), and Frequent Users (n=236).
Results: There was a significant interaction between age and group
on executive control measures, such that Frequent Users had reduced
accuracy on a measure of abstraction/mental flexibility compared to
Non-Users at younger but not older ages. Main effects of cannabis group
were found on social cognition and complex cognition; specifically, Frequent and Occasional Users were more accurate than Non-Users in facial
emotion processing and spatial abilities. Earlier onset of cannabis use
was modestly associated with worse performance in executive control,
episodic memory, language, and social cognition.
Conclusions: Overall, we found modest relationships between cannabis use and cognitive functioning, including small associations between
reduced cognitive performance and earlier initiation of use. Although
reduced mental flexibility in frequent cannabis users is concordant with
prior studies, many previously reported deficits were not replicated in
our large, community-based sample. Results also highlight previously
unidentified cognitive strengths in cannabis users, which may indicate
that individuals with stronger social and spatial skills are more vulnerable to cannabis use. Longitudinal studies with representative samples
are needed to examine dose-response effects of cannabis on brain-behavior functioning.

R. GONZALEZ, J.M. ROSS & J. DUPERROUZEL. Decision-Making
as a Risk for Development of Cannabis Dependence among Teens:
Preliminary Observations.
Objective: Studies report deficits in decision-making (DM) among cannabis users, especially among young, frequent users and those with a
cannabis use disorder. Given the role of orbitofrontal circuit dysfunction in addiction neuropathophysiology and in poor DM, it is possible
that such deficits may precede initiation and place teens at greater risk
for transitioning to cannabis addiction. We examined DM performance
among teens at risk for escalating cannabis use to determine if baseline
performance predicted development of cannabis dependence at 6-month
follow-up.
Participants and Methods: Participants were 176 adolescents, ages
14 to 17. Exclusionary criteria at screening included significant mental
health, developmental, or neurological disorders, as well as significant
other drug use. As part of a larger battery, three measures of DM were
administered: the Iowa Gambling task (IGT), the Cups Task (CT), and
the Game of Dice Task (GDT). The dependent variable for all analyses
was a dichotomous variable reflecting whether a participant transitioned
to DSM-IV cannabis dependence during their 6-month follow-up.

Forty Fourth Annual INS Meeting Abstracts
Results: Poorer expected value sensitivity on the CT gain trials and
greater number of risky choices on the GT were associated with greater
risk of conversion to cannabis dependence (p-values < .05). In contrast,
expected value sensitivity for CT loss trials and IGT performance were
not associated with our outcome (p-values > .25).
Conclusions: Among teens, aspects of DM performance were associated
with conversion to cannabis dependence 6 months later. Taken together,
these preliminary findings suggest that DM under conditions of specified
risk (i.e., when clear probabilities of gains or losses are presented) may
be an early indicator of propensity for compulsive and problematic cannabis use, especially under conditions of potential gain. Furthermore,
among teens, DM under specified risk may be a more sensitive indicator
of dysfunction than DM under ambiguity. Support: R01 DA031176 and

V.J. HINTON, R.J. FEE, K. ENGELSTAD & D.C. DE VIVO. The
Cognitive and Behavioral Phenotype Associated with Glut 1
Deficiency Syndrome.
Objective: To characterize the neurobehavioral profile associated with
Glut-1 Deficiency Syndrome (Glut1 DS). Glut1 DS is characterized by a
mutation that affects the production of the Glut 1 protein that functions
as a glucose transporter across the blood-brain barrier. Affected individuals present with infantile-onset epilepsy refractory to medications,
developmental delays, movement disorders and deceleration of head
growth. Current standard of care involves maintaining the children on a
ketogenic diet. We have evaluated children presenting with the disorder
and describe their cognitive and behavioral phenotype.
Participants and Methods: 43 children with Glut1 DS (4-12 years, 22
male) were given a battery of tests that included the Kaufman Assessment Battery for Children (KABC), Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test
(PPVT) and Expressive Vocabulary Test (EVT) and Vineland Scales
of Adaptive Behavior (VABS).
Results: Overall, mean IQ fell in the mild intellectual delay range
(mean, sd = 72,16), and the data were normally distributed (Kolmogrov-Smirnov z=.68, ns). On the KABC, Sequential Processing was
significantly higher than Simultaneous Processing (mean, sd: Sequential
81, 18; Simultaneous: 69, 16, paired t = 5.29, p<.001). On language
measures, receptive vocabulary was significantly better than expressive vocabulary (mean, sd PPVT: 79, 18; EVT 64, 15, paired t= 3.98,
p<.001). Adaptive behaviors were low, yet variable (VABS ABC mean,
sd = 64, 23). Socialization skills were significant strengths (mean, sd:
Communication 71, 25; Daily Living 59, 25; Socialization 82, 22, paired
ts = 8.23, 3.60, ps < .001).
Conclusions: Individuals with Glut 1 DS have a characteristic neurobehavioral profile that includes mild intellectual delays and lowered
adaptive skills. Strengths are observed in sequential processing and
receptive vocabulary skills, with notably good social abilities.

K.S. MANGIN, L.J. HORWOOD & L.J. WOODWARD. Trajectories of
Cognitive Development in Very Preterm and Typically Developing
Children.
Objective: Cognitive delay is common amongst children born very
preterm. However, very little is known about how these difficulties develop with age or the mechanisms that increase longer-term risk. This
study used growth curve modeling to describe patterns of cognitive
development from 4 to 12 years in very preterm and full term born
children, and identify predictors of children’s cognitive development
over time. Predictors examined included; family social risk, sex, and

255
the severity of cerebral white matter abnormalities on MRI at term
equivalent age.
Participants and Methods: Data were drawn from a prospective longitudinal cohort study of 110 very preterm (≤32 weeks gestation) children
born between December 1998−2000 and a comparison group of 113
full term born children. General cognitive functioning was assessed at
repeated intervals (corrected ages 4, 6, 9, and 12 years) using short
forms of the WPPSI-R and WISC-IV and cognitive trajectories were
examined using linear mixed effects growth curve analysis. White matter
abnormalities on term MRI and early family social risk provided measures of biological and environmental risk, respectively.
Results: At all ages, very preterm children obtained lower IQ scores than
their full term born peers (p<.001), with a minimum average decrement
of 9 IQ points. Growth curve modelling showed that both groups had
relatively stable cognitive trajectories across childhood, with no evidence
of increasing or decreasing risk of delay with age. Results supported a
cumulative risk model, with sex (p<.05), family social risk (p<.05) and
neonatal white matter abnormalities on term MRI (p<.001) significantly
predicting cognitive performance.
Conclusions: Children born very preterm are at elevated risk of cognitive impairment. Study findings suggest that despite some intra-individual variability, cognitive functioning of typical and high risk very
preterm children was stable and influenced by early neurological development and the child rearing environment.

L.C. COSTA, J. SIDERIS, M. GREEN & S.R. HOOPER. First Grade
Predictors of Early Elementary School Writing Skills Through
Fourth Grade.
Objective: The aim of this longitudinal study was to identify early elementary (1st grade) predictors of later (4th grade) writing skills (i.e.,
text generation). We explored the contributions of 1st grade individual
predictor measures (e.g., hand dexterity, rapid letter naming, working
memory, word retrieval) and latent trait predictors (i.e., fine-motor,
language, executive functions) to writing in 2nd, 3rd, and 4th grades.
Participants and Methods: Participants (n =137) began participation
in 1st grade and were followed through 4th grade. The participants were
assigned to one of two groups based on their writing performance in
first grade: typically developing writers or struggling writers. Measures
included tests of motor (dominant and non-dominant hand dexterity),
language (phonological awareness, receptive vocabulary, rapid letter
naming and orthographic processing), and executive functions (working
memory, planning and inhibition of response). The primary writing
outcome was the WIAT-II Written Expression Scale. To examine the
predictive value of the measures, we conducted step-wise longitudinal
logistic regressions to explore relationships among writing risk (i.e.,
bottom quartile) and the targeted predictors over time.
Results: Preliminary results indicated that the latent variables were predictive of being at-risk for difficulties in writing. Specifically, findings
suggested that the latent trait of fine-motor was able to predict 58%
of cases, language accounted for 64%, and executive functions 71%.
Further data analyses will compare whether the latent traits accounted
for more variance for at-risk status than single measures.
Conclusions: Results suggest that fine-motor skills, language, and executive functions contributed to writing. We will examine the relative
predictive value of these latent traits versus specific measures at 1st
grade across 2nd, 3rd, and 4th grades. The evidence from this study
could be used to develop writing assessments and to target specific
interventions to develop early writing skills.

E. TROYB, R. MCLEAN & B.A. JERSKEY. Examining the
Relationship Between Restricted and Repetitive Behaviors
and Executive Functioning in Children with Autism Spectrum
Disorders.
Objective: The executive dysfunction theory of Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASDs) proposes that restricted and repetitive behaviors (RRBs)
result from deficits in planning, self-monitoring, inhibition of ongoing
behaviors, and initiation of new behavior (Russell, 1997). Research
examining the role EF plays on RRBs has been limited and has yielded
mixed results (Leekham et al., 2011). The current study examined the
relationship between RRBs and EF among children with ASD.
Participants and Methods: Participants were obtained from the Autism Consortium Clinical Genetics Database and included 64 children
aged 6-18 years (M=9.8, SD=3.4; IQ: M=99.7, SD=19.7) and 50 children aged 2-5 years (M=4.1 years, SD=1.0; IQ: M=91.3, SD=20.5).
RRBs were assessed with the Repetitive Behavior Scale, Revised and
EF was examined with the Global Executive Composite (GEC) of the
Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function (BRIEF) and the
BRIEF, Preschool.
Results: Linear regression indicated that EF significantly predicted
stereotyped behaviors (Age 2-5: F(1, 48)=9.8; Age 6-18: F(1, 62)=12.2;
both p’s<.01, both Adjusted R2=.15), ritualistic behaviors (Age 2-5: F(1,
48)=14.9, Adjusted R2=.22; Age 6-18: F(1, 62)=7.7, Adjusted R2=.10;
both p’s<.01), and insistence on sameness (Age 2-5: F(1, 48)=13.9, Adjusted R2=.21; Age 6-18: F(1, 62)=9.3, Adjusted R2=.12; both p’s<.01).
In addition to these factors, among children aged 2-5 years, EF also predicted self-injurious behaviors (F(1, 48)=10.3, p<.01, Adjusted R2=.16)
and compulsive behaviors (F(1, 48)=8.1, p<.01, Adjusted R2=.13). EF
did not predict restricted interests in either age group. The results did
not change when controlling for IQ.
Conclusions: These results suggest that deficits in EF may result in
some RRBs, as predicted by the executive dysfunction theory. But, contrary to the theory, EF did not predict circumscribed interests. Future
studies should explore the possibility that early RRBs impact the development of EF.

Symposium 13. Risk Factors in the Development of
Executive Functioning in Children

T. DUFFIELD, J.R. LOWE, R. WEBER, A. JOHNSON &
T. LAFAVOR. Risk Factors in the Development of Executive
Functioning in Children.
Symposium Description: The term executive functioning (EF) refers
to higher-order cognitive skills required in the processes of planning
and organizing behavior and regulating feelings and thoughts (Diamond, 2013). They are thought to develop over time, increase in complexity, and underlie goal setting (Best, Miller, & Jones, 2009) and
are of particular interest due to their widespread roles in supporting
academic, social, and adaptive functioning (Garon, Bryson & Smith,
2008; Rothbart, Ahadi, Hershey, & Fisher, 2001). Numerous indicators of risk exist including poverty, preterm birth, and homelessness
and high residential mobility (HHM) (Blair & Razza, 2007; Burnett,
Scratch & Anderson, 2013; Obradovic, 2010). Independently these are
concerning; however, they frequently co-occur, and the compounding
effect may be even more impactful. Identification and understanding
of indicators of risk is required in order to understand and promote EF
development. This symposium consists of 3 studies that collectively span
the developmental stages of preschool, childhood, and pre-adolescence;

each study examines the relative contributions of these risk indicators on
childhood EF, both in their performance on EF tasks and in caregiver
ratings of their daily EF. Paper 1, by Duvall, Erickson, MacLean, Duffield, and Lowe, examined risk factors that predict EF in preschoolers
born preterm, with gestational age and maternal depression significantly
contributing to EF task performance and EF ratings. Paper 2, by Weber
and Johnson, examined risk and resilience factors that predict EF in
linguistically diverse children, with caregiver education interacting with
dual language exposure to predict EF task performance. Paper 3, by
Lafavor, examined the contributions of HHM and cognitive ability in
predicting EF, with HHM status predicting parent ratings of EF above
and beyond IQ. These results will be discussed in regards to their commonalities and implications for research and clinical practice.

S. DUVALL, S.J. ERICKSON, P.C. MACLEAN, T. DUFFIELD &
J.R. LOWE. Risk Factors for Executive Function in Preschoolers
Born Preterm.
Objective: Children born very preterm (<32 weeks) are at risk for a
variety of neurodevelopmental difficulties. Executive Function (EF)
has been shown to be an outcome measure with real world functional
correlates. The goal is to explore the risk factors related to EF in preschoolers born very preterm.
Participants and Methods: Participants included 61 very preterm preschoolers 3-4.5 years old. Performance measures of EF (Dimensional
Change Card Sort-Separated task (DCCS-Sep), Gift Peek, Gift Open)
and parent report of EF (BRIEF-P) were utilized. Multiple regression
analyses were adjusted for age and examined the relationship between
the EF measures and the following risk factors: gestational age, maternal education, family income and maternal Beck Depression Inventory
(BDI) score.
Results: Gestational age alone predicted performance on the DCCS-Sep
task. The BRIEF-P Flexibility Index and performance on Gift Open were
associated with maternal BDI and gestational age. Performance on Gift
Peek and the BRIEF-P Global Executive Composite (GEC), Inhibitory
Self-Control Index and Metacognitive Index, were uniquely associated
with maternal BDI. Similar patterns of results were found when FSIQ
was included as a predictor.
Conclusion: EF in very preterm preschoolers showed associations with
some perinatal and maternal risk factors, especially gestational age at
birth and maternal depressive symptoms (BDI), as well as different patterns of risk factors for different types of EF measures. Gestational age
at birth was solely associated with a measure of EF related to set-shifting
and maternal BDI scores were partially associated with an inhibition
measure. Questionnaire measures of EF were associated with self-report
BDI scores and gestational age for one index. Increasing our understanding of the relationship between specific maternal and child risk factors
and EF outcomes in this vulnerable population may help us to develop
enhanced interventions for children and families.

R. WEBER & A. JOHNSON. Risk Factors for Executive Functioning
in Linguistically Diverse Children.
Objective: This study examines the contributions of risk and resilience
variables to the executive functioning (EF) of children in a linguistically diverse sample. While poverty is considered an indicator of risk
for cognitive outcomes (Lipina & Colombo, 2009), bilingualism, and
potentially dual-language exposure, may enhance specific cognitive
skills, especially in low-income minority children (Engel de Abreu,
Cruz-Santos, Tourinho, Martin, & Bialystok, 2012). Previous studies
demonstrate that bilingualism and SES independently predict EF task
performance but do not significantly interact (Calvo & Bialystok, 2014).

Forty Fourth Annual INS Meeting Abstracts
This study expands upon previous research by examining the contributions of caregiver education, dual language exposure, bilingual competence, and their interactions, to EF task performance and caregiver
ratings of daily EF.
Participants and Methods: A total of 78 children (ages 4-7) and their
caregivers were recruited in the Southwestern United States. Demographic data and EF ratings were collected from caregivers and all
participants completed measures of receptive vocabulary and five EF
tasks. Dual language exposure and bilingual competence were determined by receptive vocabulary in English and Spanish.
Results: Hierarchical multiple regressions examined the contributions
of the variables of interest. Surprisingly, none of the variables independently contributed to models for EF performance or caregiver ratings
of daily EF. A significant interaction between dual language exposure
and SES emerged for two conditions of a selective attention task.
Conclusions: These findings are largely inconsistent with the literature
base, though the interaction effect offers interesting opportunities for
future research and discussion. It is likely that the tasks included in this
study and the populations sampled play a large role in the deviation of
these findings from previous research in this area.

T. LAFAVOR. Executive Function in Homeless and Highly Mobile
Children.
Objective: This study examined the relationship between homeless/
highly mobile (HM) status and cognitive ability and executive function (EF). Evidence demonstrates the role EF in supporting related
domains including achievement. The deleterious effects of poverty on
development including deficits in EF have been well established (Blair
& Razza, 2007). Less research has focused on HHM specifically, but
results implicate the role of regulation (Obradovic, 2010). In studies
of children reared in poverty, there are clear groups who demonstrate
positive adaptation (Buckner, et al., 2003; Flores, et al., 2005; Obradovic, et al., 2009). Targeting EF in these children may be an effective
way to lessen the effects of HHM on development (Alvord & Grados,
2005; Feder et al., 2009).
Methods and Participants: A total of 86 children (ages 9 to 11) living in
emergency homeless shelters were recruited along with their caregiver.
Children completed perceptual reasoning tasks and performance based
measures of EF (cognitive flexibility, planning, problem solving, and
self-monitoring). Parents were interviewed about demographic information, life events, and child EF, behavior, and health.
Results: Results demonstrate significantly lower perceptual reasoning
among HHM participants compared to normative samples, and HHM
status was predictive of parent-reported difficulties with shifting, emotional control, planning, and organization above and beyond IQ. HHM
status was not predictive of task-based EF performance.
Conclusions: Results are consistent with previous findings and underscore the importance of developing targeted intervention to improve the
lives of HHM children. Achievement related gaps continue to increase,
with poor and HHM students disproportionately affected. Targeted EF
intervention has the potential to ameliorate the effects of poverty and
promote competence in success in multiple developmental domains.

Emotional Processes
C. CHAMPAGNE, A. G. SENI, E. VERA-ESTAY & M.H. BEAUCHAMP.
Attribution of moral emotions to social decision-making from
childhood to early adulthood.
Objective: Social decision-making and emotion processing are part of
social cognition, an array of functions necessary for appropriate social
interactions and susceptible to impairment after various developmental and acquired conditions. Mature moral reasoning and attribution
of moral emotions, in particular, are essential to socially adaptive behaviour. The aim of this study was to study the use of basic and moral
emotion attribution following moral decision-making, using a novel
moral reasoning assessment tool.
Participants and Methods: 193 healthy participants were divided into
three groups: children 6-12 years (n = 76, M = 9.20, SD = 1.67), adolescents 13-17 years (n = 75, M = 14.93 SD = 1.52) and young adults
18-21 years (n = 42, M = 18.10, SD = 1.54). The Socio-Moral Reasoning
Aptitude Level task (So-Moral, Beauchamp, Dooley & Anderson, 2013)
was used to measure moral maturity and emotions in the context of
visual vignettes of moral dilemmas incorporating socio-moral values.
Results: Frequencies of emotional attributions after moral decision-making were as follows: Children 40.35% basic emotions (BE),
51.31% moral emotions (ME) and 8.34% indifference; Adolescents
32.89% BE, 60.44% ME and 6.67% indifference; and Young adults
24.60% BE, 63.49% ME and 11.91% indifference.
Conclusions: Decisions taken in the context of moral dilemmas appear to be emotionally charged in all age groups. Only a minority of
participants were indifferent to the decision they made regarding their
involvement in a moral conflict. The use of moral emotions increased
with age. Future work should verify whether this increase is associated
with greater moral maturity. The presence and progression of moral
emotions in the So-Moral task suggests that the dilemmas presented
tap into expected levels of emotion attribution.

Hormones, Emotional Responses to Stress and Trait Emotional
Intelligence: A Monozygotic Twin Study.
Objective: Utilizing the monozygotic-twin differences (MZ-diff)
method, we examined the association between physiological and emotional reactions to psychosocial stress and trait emotional intelligence
(trait EI) among MZ twin girls. The MZ-diff design allowed us to
rigorously test non-shared environmental effects on these association
by eliminating the confound arose from twin differences in genes and
shared environment.
Participants and Methods: Twenty-six pairs of healthy MZ girls
completed the Trier Social Stress Test for Children (TSST-C). Saliva
samples were collected for cortisol levels, and subjective emotional responses before and after the TSST-C were assessed. The participants
also described three subscales of trait EI; emotional self-control, emotional self-expression and awareness of other’s feelings.
Results: MZ-diff in awareness of other’s feelings was significantly associated with MZ-diff in the emotional responses to stress (r = .535,
p < .05) but not with MZ-diff in AUCi of cortisol (r = .038, n.s.). In
addition, MZ-diffs in emotional self-control and emotional self-expression were associated with neither MZ-diff in the emotional responses
to stress (in order, r = .046, .105, n.s.) nor AUCi of cortisol (in order,
r = -.146, .192, n.s.).

258
Conclusions: The association between one subscale of trait EI, awareness of other’s feelings, and emotional responses to psychosocial stress
might be explained by non-shared environment. The relation between
trait EI and cortisol was not significant. The genetic and shared/nonshared environmental factors might play different roles according to the
different subscales of trait EI.

Objective: Emotion regulation is affected by many conditions and is
critical for adaptive emotional functioning. As such, it is important to
gain a better understanding of the component cognitive processes that
are important for emotion regulation. Therefore, this study aimed to examine the role of inhibition and working memory in emotion regulation.
Participants and Methods: The sample consisted of 81 undergraduate
students (Mage=20.46). The measures included a demographic questionnaire, an emotion regulation self-report scale (Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale; DERS) and a performance-based task involving
attention and working memory (Modified Emotional Face N-Back task;
Modified EFNBACK).
Results: Bivariate correlations were performed between the EFNBACK
and the DERS. The DERS Total Score positively correlated with reaction
time in the Fear-no-memory-load condition r=.270, p=.027, as well as
with the total errors on the Neutral-no-memory-load condition r=.284,
p=.020. Subscales of the DERS, (i.e., Awareness, Strategies, Goals,
Nonacceptance and Impulse) also demonstrated significantly positive
correlations with specific reaction time speeds as well as total errors in
most EFNBACK conditions.
Conclusions: The literature supports the use of objective measurement to better understand emotion regulation ability. According to the
findings of this study, self-report difficulties in emotion regulation are
associated with an objective emotion regulation measure. Such an objective tool of emotion regulation could prove to be useful in evaluating
and treating clinical populations with emotion dysregulation. Future
research is necessary in order to adequately validate this measure.

Response to Monetary Reward versus Loss Predicts Symptoms in
Mood Disordered Youth.
Objective: This pilot project aimed to characterize mood symptoms
based on biomarkers associated with reward and loss. Reward and loss
sensitivity were assessed using event-related potentials [ERPs], the
Feedback Negativity [FN] (initial processing of good v. bad outcome
information) and the P300 [P3] (later controlled processing). Greater
differentiation between gains and losses—indicating greater reactivity
to reward stimuli—were expected to be associated with greater mania,
while smaller differences would be associated with depression.
Participants and Methods: Symptoms of 18 adolescents (Mean age=
14.67) from a mood disorders clinic were assessed by interview (Mania
Rating Scale: M=17.38, SD=3.10; Depression Rating Scale: M=26.81,
SD=12.34). Adolescents were administered a computerized task and
told to respond as quickly and accurately to win money (25 cents).
Feedback was rigged so that loss feedback was given on 40% of correct
trials (loss of 25 cents). FN (FCz, Fz, Cz combined) was the mean
negative amplitude 250-350ms after feedback, and P3 (Pz) was the
mean amplitude 300-400ms after feedback, each averaged across win/
loss trials. Analyses involved difference scores [D] (DFN= loss-gains;
DP3=gain-loss), where greater values (negative and positive) reflect
greater reactivity.
Results: Linear regression, controlling for age, examined whether the
DFN or DP3 predicted symptoms. The DFN did not predict symptoms
of depression (β=.19, t =.57 p=.58) or mania (β=-.18, t =-56, p=.58).
However, while the DP3 was not associated with symptoms of mania

(β=-.35, t =-1.42, p=.18), it did predict symptoms of depression (R2=
.35, β=-.59, t =-2.59, p=.02).
Conclusions: While early stages of appraisal of feedback for win-loss
outcomes, as assessed with FN, do not predict mood symptoms in adolescents, smaller differences in P3 in response to gains versus loss
were associated with greater depression. Reduced responsivity to reward
in depression may be due to blunted top-down evaluation of reward
stimuli.

M. FEIGON, M. KASSEL, L. GABRIEL, J.A. RAO, S. POCIUS,
D. RAMAHI & S.A. LANGENECKER. Gender Differences in
Emotional Valence on the Semantic List learning Task.
Objective: Emotional valence, or how happy or sad a person feels, in
hearing a specific word has been implicated in attention and recall.
Memory strengthening tends to occur for more emotionally laden versus neutral information. Women typically outperform men on memory
tasks and also are more likely to recall emotionally laden information.
Depressed individuals, independent of gender, have also been shown to
experience better recall for more negative information than for neutral
or positive information. The purpose of this study was to examine gender differences and the emotional valence of specific words in healthy
controls versus remitted depressed individuals on the Semantic List
Learning Task (SLLT).
Participants and Methods: Participants (n= 49) were administered
alternate versions of the SLLT (14 words, 12 categories) along with
self-report measures of mood over two time points and asked to rate the
valence, arousal, and dominance of each word on a 5-point Likert scale.
Results: Gender differences were observed only on the category of
alcoholic beverages for valence. There were no differences observed
on arousal or dominance of alcoholic beverages. This difference was
observed independent of healthy controls or remitted depressed status.
A chi-squared test revealed that “tequila” and “beer” were more emotionally laden for women than for men. Recall of the word “tequila” was
significantly correlated to emotional valence for both men and women
although “beer” was not. There were no differences between remitted
depressed and healthy control groups in valence, arousal, or dominance
ratings.
Conclusions: Gender differences were observed for the emotional valence of primarily negative words, specifically, types of alcoholic beverages. Gender differences were not observed between other categories of
positive or neutral words. Additional studies are needed to determine if
gender differences extend to recall and recognition of word items with
greater emotional valence.

P.A. FIGUEROA, K.A. BURNETT, A.A. VAILLANCOURT,
L.K. PAUL & W.S. BROWN. Cognitive and Emotional Dimensions
of Empathy in Individuals with Agenesis of the Corpus Callosum.
Objective: Previous research demonstrated that adults with agenesis of
the corpus callosum (ACC) and normal full-scale intelligence quotients
(FSIQ) have significantly reduced theory of mind and ability to accurately recognize the emotions of others (Symington, Paul, Symington,
Ono, & Brown, 2010; Bridgman, Brown, Spezio, Leonard, Adolphs, &
Paul, 2014), having particular difficulty recognizing negative emotions.
The objective of the current study was to determine if individuals with
ACC are aware of their deficiency – that is, do they nevertheless respond
similar to neurotypical controls on a self-report scale of empathy.
Participants and Methods: The Interpersonal Reactivity Index (IRI;
Davis, 1980) was administered online to 17 individuals with ACC (age
range: 19-55; MFSIQ: 104) and to 24 age- and IQ-matched controls
(age range: 19-64; MFSIQ: 108). The IRI is a self-report measure of

Forty Fourth Annual INS Meeting Abstracts
empathy along cognitive (Fantasy and Perspective Taking) and emotional dimensions (Empathic Concern and Personal Distress).
Results: Multivariate analysis of variance over the four dimensions of
the IRI revealed no significant overall differences between ACC and neurotypical controls, F(4, 36) = 0.92, p = .54; etap2 = .08. Furthermore,
univariate tests demonstrated no significant differences between ACC
and neurotypical controls across the four subscales of Fantasy (etap2 =
.000), Perspective Taking (etap2 = .004), Empathic Concern (etap2 =
.052), and Personal Distress (etap2 = .017).
Conclusions: Results demonstrated that there is no difference in self-reports of empathy between individuals with ACC and neurotypical controls despite clear evidence of difference in direct tests of recognizing
and understanding the emotions of others – their self-understanding
differs from behavioral tests of empathy. Thus, adults with ACC, when
given unlimited time to ponder over questions, have the ability to make
prototypical responses in regards to social norms of empathy, but nevertheless lack insight about their own behavior.

C.L. HAAK, I. REIFE, J. KIM & L.G. TALL. Social Language
Abilities as a Moderator of Child and Parent Report of Internalizing
Symptoms.
Objective: Previous research found that children with difficulties in
pragmatic language were more likely to have poorer social skills, behavioral adjustment, and internalizing symptoms (McCabe, 2005; Calvete,
2011). Although parent report is primarily used for behavior ratings,
child reports provide information about self-perceptions and differences
in perceptions of behaviors among parents and children (Hope et al.,
1999; Nugent et al., 2013).
Participants and Methods: Data from 51 participants including a
two hour individual cognitive assessment, self-reports and history questionnaires were used. The Behavioral Assessment System for Children
(BASC-2) was used as a self-report measure of children’s internalizing
symptoms as reported by children and parents. The Supralinguistic composite of the Comprehensive Assessment of Spoken Language (CASL)
was used to measure social language abilities. A regression analysis was
conducted to investigate whether pragmatic language ability moderates
the relationship between child and parent reported internalizing scores.
Results: A significant relationship between children and parents’ BASC
internalizing scores (r = 0.36, p = 0.01) was found. The interaction
term accounted for a significant proportion of the variance in parent
reported symptoms (ΔR2=0.11, ΔF(4.46)=7.36, b=0.04, t(46)= -2.714,
p=.0.01). Results indicated that the Supralinguistic composite significantly moderated the relationship between child and parent report of
internalizing symptoms.
Examination of the interaction plot showed an enhancing effect with
higher CASL scores indicating a stronger relationship between child
and parent reports.
Conclusions: Children’s social language ability was found to moderate
the relationship between child and parent reported internalizing symptoms, with greater social language ability strengthening the relationship.
This indicates for children with weak social language ability, both child
and parent report should be interpreted more in-depth to understand
the child’s internalizing symptoms.

K. HARRIS, V. MONTGOMERY & L.H. LU. Predictive Value of
Motoric and Depressive Symptoms on Functional Impairment in
Parkinson’s Disease Patients.
Objective: Functional impairment is associated with diminished quality
of life in patients with Parkinson’s disease (PD; Schrag et al., 2000).
Depressive symptoms have a prevalence of about 52% in PD, though

259
these symptoms are often not prioritized in assessment and treatment
given the prominence of motor symptoms in the disease (Reijnders et al.,
2008). Although deficits to activities of daily living (ADLs) are common
in PD, evaluation of the unique contribution of motoric and depressive
symptoms to informant-reported functional impairment has yet to be
examined in a large geographically diverse sample. We hypothesize that
each of these symptom clusters will contribute to predicting functional
impairment in PD.
Participants and Methods: We examined whether motoric and depressive symptoms predicted functional impairment using data from
438 PD participants from the National Alzheimer’s Coordinating Center
Uniform Data Set. We conducted exploratory analyses using stepwise
regression to examine the extent to which the Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale—Motor Examination (UPDRS—Motor) and Geriatric
Depression Scale (GDS) predicted functional impairment as measured
by the informant-based Functional Assessment Questionnaire (FAQ).
Results: Results indicated that a two-variable model in which the
UPDRS motor scores accounted for 29.9% of the variance and GDS
scores accounted for an additional 11.8% of the variance predicted FAQ
(F(2,68)=24.32, p<.001).
Conclusions: Our results suggest that depressive symptoms accounted
for a significant amount of the variance of functional impairment above
and beyond that which was accounted for by motor symptoms alone.
Given the impact these symptoms may have on functionality and the
implications of functional impairment on caregiver burden and patients’
quality of life, our findings support comprehensive evaluation and treatment of depressive symptoms in patients with PD.

J.N. IKANGA, J.L. GESS & A.Y. STRINGER. An Empirical Approach
to Defining Emotional Communication Disorders (ECD).
Objective: We attempted to identify subtypes of emotional communication impairment consistent with clinical literature and to specify and
validate empirical criteria defining each subtype.
Participants and Methods: Archival review of a mixed neurological
sample (76 epilepsy, 23 stroke, 4 neoplasm, 5 concussion) identified
109 patients (57 female; 82 white; 95 right-handed) examined for production, imitation, and comprehension of affective prosody and facial
expression using the Affective Communication Test (ACT). Patients
were divided into 2 samples equivalent on demographic and diagnostic
variables. Separate cluster analyses (CA) were run to identify ECD and
develop classification rules in each sample. Rules were cross-validated
in the opposite sample using coefficient kappa (κ) as an index of agreement. Rules showing highest agreement across samples where applied
to the total group of patients, followed by calculation of sensitivity and
specificity.
Results: CA yielded meaningful results when prosody (7 clusters in
both samples) and facial affect (7 clusters in sample 1, 4 in sample 2)
were examined separately, with the clusters reflecting different patterns
of affect production, imitation and comprehension as expected. ACT
score criteria were successfully identified that allowed minimum overlap
between clusters in each sample. Cross-validation of criteria suggested
better classification agreement when sample 1 criteria were applied to
sample 2 (κProsody=.861,p<.001; κfacial=.402,p<.001). Applied to
the entire group of patients, sample 1 criteria had high sensitivity and
specificity to prosody disorder. Sample 1 criteria, however, had high
specificity but low sensitivity to facial affect disorder.
Conclusions: CA revealed ECD subtypes consistent with many clinically described patterns. Empirical criteria showed poor sensitivity to
facial affect disorder. Empirical criteria with good sensitivity and specificity were developed and cross validated for prosody disorder, but
further validation in a larger sample is needed.

P.C. KLINEBURGER, K.M. LIPPOLD, N.M. DARDEN &
D.W. HARRISON. Frontal Lobe Deactivation During Intense
Music-Evoked Emotion.
Objective: The Functional Capacity Theory (Klineburger & Harrison,
2015) proposes that the frontal lobes have a functional capacity that
when exceeded results in the inhibitory release of the temporal and parietal lobes leading to intense emotional arousal. The Functional Capacity
Theory’s proposal that the relationship between emotional intensity
and frontal lobe activity is nonlinear is counter to current theories of
emotion. Emotionally evocative music was used to exceed frontal lobe
capacity and evoke intense positive emotions.
Participants and Methods: Forty-eight participants listened to music and continuously rated their emotional intensity with a dial while
Electroencephalogram was recorded. A repeated measure ANOVA was
performed with EEG beta power as the dependent variable and TIME
(baseline, music-onset, and peak-emotion), and LOCATION (left frontal, right frontal, left posterior, and right posterior) as the within-subjects factors.
Results: A significant LOCATION by TIME interaction was found, F(6,
138) = 6.72, p < .0001. There was a significant decrease in beta power
at the left frontal region from baseline to peak emotion, t = 1.97, p <
.05. During the peak-emotion phase, beta power at the left frontal site
was significantly lower than the left posterior site, t = 2.69, p <. 01,
and beta power at the right frontal site was significantly lower than the
right posterior site, t = 2.69, p. < 01.

Conclusions: The relative changes in frontal versus posterior activity
in this experiment during intense emotional arousal referred to as a
peak-emotion supports the Functional Capacity Theory and may contribute to a larger understanding of how the frontal lobes and posterior
sensory regions interact during intense emotions. This experiment may
contribute to the music-evoked emotion and emotion-regulation literature by providing further evidence that frontal lobe activity initially
increases but then decreases during intensely pleasurable emotions.

Validity and Utility of Novel Primary Emotions in Multichannel
Emotion Perception Tasks.
Objective: The New York Emotion Battery (NYEB; Borod, Welkowitz,
& Obler, 1992) employs novel emotions (along with standard ones,—
happiness, sadness, fear, disgust, and anger) to evaluate emotion perception abilities. The emotions “pleasant surprise,” “unpleasant surprise,”
and “interest” used in the NYEB are rarely used in tasks assessing
emotion perception. This study examines the validity and utility of using
these emotions within measures of emotion perception.
Participants and Methods: Participants were 122 healthy, righthanded adults, aged 20 to 88 years. Participants were evenly divided
distributed by decade within this age range, evenly distributed by sex
and by ethnicity, and were screened for major medical, neurological,
and psychiatric disorders, as well as substance abuse. Participants were
administered the emotion perception tasks from the NYEB. Stimuli
were presented in three communication channels (facial, prosodic/intonational, and lexical/verbal), with identification and discrimination
subtests in each channel.
Results: Principal components analyses with varimax rotation were
performed, separately, on the items comprising each subtest and on
the total subtest scores. The novel emotions showed strong positive
loadings on the first (general) factor in all analyses. Pleasant surprise
and interest stimuli showed positive loadings, and unpleasant surprise
showed negative loadings on a second factor consistent with the approach/withdrawal model of emotion (Davidson et al., 1990).
Conclusions: The ability to recognize interest and unpleasant surprise
was consistent with the ability to recognize other primary emotions. All
three novel emotions showed consistency with an approach/withdrawal
model of emotion.

Startling Facts about Emotion in Essential Tremor: Blunted
emotional reactivity as indexed by the startle eyeblink response.
Objective: Essential Tremor is a highly prevalent movement disorder
characterized by intention tremor and mild cognitive-executive changes.
These features are commonly attributed to abnormal cerebellar changes,
resulting in disruption of cerebellar-thalamic-cortical networks. Less
attention has been paid to alterations in basic emotion processing in ET,
despite known cerebellar-limbic interconnectivity. In the current study,
we tested the hypothesis that a psychophysiologic index of emotional
reactivity, the emotion modulated startle reflex, would be muted in
individuals with ET relative to controls.
Participants and Methods: Participants included 19 ET patients and
18 age and education-matched controls, who viewed standard sets of
pleasant, unpleasant and neutral pictures (IAPS) for 6 sec. each. During
picture viewing, white noise bursts (95db, 50ms) were binaurally presented to elicit startle eyeblinks measured over the orbicularis oculi.
Subjective picture ratings of valence and arousal were obtained. The ET

Forty Fourth Annual INS Meeting Abstracts
and control groups were not demented or depressed based on cognitive
and mood screening.
Results: At baseline, the groups did not differ in startle eyeblink latency
or amplitude. A repeated measures ANOVA revealed a significant Group
X Affect interaction (F2,70=3.90,p<0.03,ηp2=0.10). Consistent with
past literature, controls had larger startle eyeblink amplitudes while
viewing unpleasant than neutral or positive pictures (p< .001). In ET,
startle eyeblinks were not modulated by emotion. This modulation
failure was not due to medication effects, nor was it due to abnormal
picture ratings.
Conclusions: Our hypothesis was supported. Neuroanatomically, it is
unclear whether diminished startle modulation in ET is secondary to
aberrant cerebellar input into limbic and/or frontal regions involved
in emotional processing or to more direct disruption between the cerebellum and brainstem startle circuitry. If the former is correct, these
findings may be the first to reveal dysregulation of emotional networks
in ET.

L. LAU, M.R. BASSO, D.R. COMBS & D. WHITESIDE. GlobalLocal Visual Attention, Mood and Temperament.
Objective: Visual perception of global-configural and local-detail elements seems to be biased by mood. A global bias occurs with positive
mood, and a local bias coincides with negative mood. Extending these
findings, we examined the association of mood with selective attention
to global and local stimuli. Additionally, we examined whether temperament correlates with selective attention to global-local stimuli. In
particular, the Rational-Experiential temperament (Epstein et al., 1996)
may correlate with attention to global-local stimuli. Preference for experiential reasoning may correspond with a global reasoning bias, whereas
a rational reasoning preference may correlate with local reasoning.
Participants and Methods: 60 healthy undergraduates were administered the PANAS (a measure of mood), Rational Experiential Inventory
(REI: a measure of temperament), and a computer-administered global-local selective visual attention task (GLSAT). The GLSAT (Caparos
et al., 2013) presents a global-configuration comprised of local-elements. Participants identified whether a target was present in global
configuration or in the local elements.
Results: Multiple regression revealed no relationship between REI
scores and GLSAT accuracy or reaction time. However, negative affect
correlated significantly with global congruent (p ≤ 0.05) and incongruent accuracy (p < 0.05) but not local accuracy. In contrast, positive
affect correlated with reaction time to identify local targets that were
incongruent with the global configuration (p < 0.05).
Conclusions: Contrary to expectations, Rational-Experiential temperament had no relationship with global-local visual attention. Extending
previous findings, global accuracy seems reduced as negative affect
increases. Reaction time to identify local targets improved as positive
mood increased. Whereas previous research focused upon global-local
biases, these data suggest that positive and negative affect have distinct
correlates with global-local visual attention.

É. LEBLANC, C. CHAMPAGNE, E. VERA-ESTAY &
M.H. BEAUCHAMP. Affect Recognition as a Predictor of RuleBreaking and Aggressive Behaviour in Childhood.
Objective: Affect recognition (AR) is a sociocognitive skill that is related to prosocial and adaptive behaviour in childhood. There is some
evidence that deficits in AR may be associated with the presence of
maladaptive social behaviours. Childhood externalizing behaviours,
such as rule-breaking and aggressive behaviours, also represent risk
factors for the development of social problems later in life. Given these

261
associations, the aim of this study was to investigate the contribution of
AR to rule-breaking and aggressive behaviour in childhood.
Participants and Methods: Participants (N=76, M = 9.2 years old, SD
= 1.67 years, 53% female) completed the NEPSY-II Affect Recognition
subtest and rule-breaking and aggressive behaviours were measured
using the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL), completed by the primary
caregiver.
Results: Rule-breaking and aggressive behaviours were negatively correlated with AR. Linear regressions indicate that AR is a significant
predictor of externalizing behaviour problems in childhood, explaining
9.1% of rule-breaking behaviour (β = -.30, p =0.009) and 5.2% of
aggressive behaviour (β = -.23, p = 0.049).
Conclusions: AR represents an essential skill for the initiation and
the preservation of interpersonal relationships. The results suggest that
difficulties in AR, which affects social reciprocity, have an impact on
rule-breaking and aggressive behaviours. Early intervention on emotional information processing may be a useful remediation target for
reducing externalizing problems in childhood.

T.L. MCKINNEY, A. FITZNER, A. PORTHUKARAN &
C. WESTBURY. The development and validation of the Alberta
Implicit Scale of Emotional Reactivity (AISER).
Objective: Emotional reactivity is a problematic construct to measure
psychometrically, as existing measures are not framed by contextual information and are likely to be influenced by an individual’s beliefs. The
AISER is a psychological instrument that seeks to address this limitation
by inferring emotionality based on reports of behaviours, rather than
through self-reports of emotionality. The AISER was psychometrically
validated using other measures of affect, as well as experimentally using
galvanic skin conductance responses (GSR) evoked from emotionally
evocative images.
Participants and Methods: The initial item set was developed and
distributed to 171 participants for the purposes of item analysis. This
final item set of 26 items was validated with the Behavioural Inhibition/Activation Scale (BIS/BAS) and the Emotional Reactivity Scale
(ERS). The AISER’s validation was expanded in a second study of 197
participants with additional measures: the State-Trait Anxiety Index
(STAI), the Positive and Negative Affective Schedule (PANAS), and
the Marlowe-Crowne Social Desirability Scale (SD). Furthermore, 53
participants participated in an experimental validation session, where
their GSR was measured in relation to evocative images as an objective
validation of all scales.
Results: The first study established the AISER as reliable (alpha=0.88)
and valid through correlations with the ERS (r=0.69) and the BIS
(r=0.46). This pattern was replicated in the second study, extending
to state anxiety (r=0.57) and the BAS (r=0.25). State anxiety and the
PANAS did not correlate with the AISER (r=0.06, 0.003). The AISER
had higher scores compared to the ERS in the top 15% of SD scoring
participants, though this did not reach significance. The GSR scores had
no significant correlations with any of the examined scales.
Conclusions: The AISER was developed and validated as a robust
psychometric measure of emotional reactivity by inferring emotional
reactivity through behavioural indices.

E.P. MELTZER, J.C. BOROD & L. RABIN. Validation of the
Emotion Regulation Questionnaire (ERQ) and Cognitive Emotion
Regulation Questionnaire (CERQ) in Non-Demented Older Adults
with Varying Degrees of Cognitive Complaints and/or Difficulties.
Objective: The 10-item ERQ (Gross & John, 2003) measures self-reported use of cognitive reappraisal and expressive suppression, and the

262
36-item CERQ (Garnefski et al., 2001) measures self-reported use of
nine regulation strategies that can be grouped into “adaptive” and “maladaptive” approaches. The factor structures of the ERQ and CERQ have
been validated in healthy adolescent and/or young adult samples (e.g.,
Garnefski et al., 2001; Gross & John, 2003; Melka et al., 2011), though
not in older adults or in relation to cognitive functioning. We examined
the factor structure of both the ERQ and CERQ in non-demented older
adults, with varying degrees of cognitive problems, and attempted to
replicate the findings from the younger adult samples.
Participants and Methods: Participants were non-demented older
adults (M age=81.6±5.8, 67.7% female) with varying degrees of cognitive complaints and/or difficulties (21.5% MCI, 32.3% Subjective
Cognitive Decline, & 46.2% Healthy Controls) from the Einstein Aging
Study in the Bronx, New York. Participants completed the ERQ (n=196)
and CERQ (n=181). Principal components analyses with varimax rotation were conducted, separately, on the ERQ and CERQ item responses.
Results: The original 2-factor structure (Cognitive Reappraisal and
Expressive Suppression) of the ERQ was not replicated with all 10 items.
However, with removal of 2 items, the two same factors were obtained.
For the CERQ, the original 2-factor structure (Maladaptive and Adaptive approaches) was not clearly observed with all 36 questionnaire
items, but was obtained with removal of 5 items.
Conclusions: The findings suggest that modified versions of the ERQ
and CERQ are useful tools for measuring the use of emotion regulation
strategies in older adults with varying degrees of cognitive problems.
Findings have implications for appropriate assessment of emotion regulation in aging populations.

T.E. MYERS, K. SAVAGE, K. FINLEY, J.T. TWAITE,
W.H. KRAUSE, J.L. STORBECK & J.C. BOROD. The “In-Group
Advantage” for Perceiving Emotion across Demographic Groups
and Communication Channels.
Objective: Demographic factors impact the accuracy of emotion perception and may be influenced by the presence of an “in-group advantage” (IGA; Elfenbein & Ambady, 2002). The purpose of the current
study was to investigate the characteristics of the emotion perception
tasks from the New York Emotion Battery (NYEB; Borod, Welkowitz,
& Obler, 1992) by examining the IGA for the demographic factors of
age and gender and the effects of ethnicity and language background
on emotion perception performance.
Participants and Methods: Using 124 healthy right-handed adults
(age range: 21-88; 56% women; 54% Caucasian; 55% native English-speaking), we examined the presence of an IGA for age and gender
using the facial and prosodic emotion perception tasks. In addition, we
examined ethnic and language background group differences on the facial, prosodic, and/or lexical emotion perception tasks. Specific emotions
(e.g., happiness & sadness) were examined as well.
Results: Results provided no support, overall, for an IGA based on
gender or age, nor were there group differences on the basis of ethnicity
or language background. Examination of specific emotions revealed
that the demographic groups performed remarkably similar to each
other, further supporting the conclusion that there was no IGA present
in this dataset.
Conclusions: There are a number of reasons why we may not have
found evidence for an IGA for any of the demographic characteristics
examined, despite reports in the literature of an IGA for each of these
demographic factors. For example, methodological differences among
studies may explain this discrepancy. Results are discussed in light of
the dialect theory (Elfenbein & Ambady, 2003), which is best supported
by our results. This study provides information about the characteristics
of emotion perception tasks as they relate to the interaction between the
demographic characteristics of the expresser (i.e., those who produced
the stimuli) and the perceiver of an emotion.

Emotion Dysregulation & Apathy: Subjective and Physiological
Responses Following a Mood Induction.
Objective: Apathy is associated with amotivation and atypical emotion
experience. Apathy is common in many neurologic disorders but there
is little evidence about links between apathy and emotion regulation.
Effective emotion regulation is essential for many life tasks, such as
effective interpersonal communication. This study determined associations between apathy and emotion regulation in healthy persons. Apathy was predicted to be associated with blunted reactivity and quicker
recovery from a negative mood induction.
Participants and Methods: Participants (N = 56, 71.9% female)
were healthy undergraduates (M age = 19.91 years, SD = 1.28) who
completed the Apathy Evaluation Scale (AES). They were shown sad
film clips to change mood. Subjective emotions were assessed with the
PANAS-X (Negative Affect, Fear, Sadness, Guilt, Hostility, Positive Affect, Joviality, Attentiveness, Assurance) prior to the videos, immediately
after, and after a recovery period. Heart rate and body temperature
were monitored.
Results: From pre- to post-film, significant (ps < .05) emotion reactions
occurred and heart rate increased. Apathy was significantly correlated
with reactivity in PA (r = .35), Assurance (r = .42), Joviality (r = .27),
and Hostility (r = -.29); greater apathy was associated with less emotion
change from pre- to post-mood induction. Contrary to expectations,
apathy was not significantly correlated with emotion recovery or physiological reactivity.
Conclusions: Consistent with theoretical models about amotivation
and lack of emotion responsiveness, apathy was associated with blunted
emotion reactivity (for positive and negative emotions) to a potent mood
induction. More research is needed with neurologic populations who
have greater variance in apathy. Further, more work into differential
links between apathy and subjective versus physiological emotion reactivity may provide insights into a disconnect between emotion awareness
and experience in persons with apathy.

D. PISNER, R. SMITH, A. ALKOZEI, A. KLIMOVA &
W.D. KILLGORE. Highways of the Emotional Intellect: White
Matter Microstructural Correlates of an Ability-Based Measure
of Emotional Intelligence.
Objective: Individuals differ in their ability to understand emotional
information and apply that understanding to make decisions and solve
problems effectively — a construct known as Emotional Intelligence
(EI). While considerable evidence supports the importance of EI in
social and occupational functioning, the neural underpinnings of this
capacity are relatively unexplored. We used Tract Based Spatial Statistics (TBSS) to interrogate the white matter correlates of EI as measured
by the ability-based Mayer–Salovey–Caruso Emotional Intelligence Test
(MSCEIT).
Participants and Methods: Participants included 33 healthy adults
(17 men; 16 women), ages 18 to 45 years. Participants completed the
MSCEIT, which assesses individual differences in the ability to perceive,
understand, manage, and facilitate emotions. Participants also underwent diffusion tensor imaging scanning at 3T. Analysis of diffusion data
was carried out using FSL, whereby TBSS was employed and each of
the four MSCEIT branches was separately regressed with FA.
Results: Understanding Emotions was associated with greater FA within
sensory-affective association tracts including the inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus, inferior longitudinal fasciculus, superior longitudinal
fasciculus, and anterior thalamic radiation (p<.05, FWE Corrected).

Forty Fourth Annual INS Meeting Abstracts
Managing Emotions was associated with greater FA within frontal-affective association tracts including the anterior forceps and uncinate
fasciculus, along with frontal-parietal cingulum tracts and interhemispheric corpus callosum tracts (p<.05, FWE Corrected).
Conclusions: To our knowledge, the present study is the first investigation of the white matter correlates of an ability-based measure of
EI. Findings show clear associations between microstructural integrity
of major axonal pathways and the Strategic branches of the MSCEIT,
even after controlling for standard cognitive IQ scores, suggesting that
the Strategic branches represent unique dimensions of human intellectual ability.

I. REIFE, C.L. HAAK, J. KIM & L.G. TALL. Social Cognition and
Internalizing Symptoms: A Pilot Analysis.
Objective: Previous research showed that children who possess stronger
social cognition skills are more likely to have positive outcomes in academics, social relations, and higher self-esteem (Barnett, 1995; Paris
& Paris, 2001). Previous research has also demonstrated that impaired
language abilities are related to poorer social skills and behavioral maladjustment (McCabe, 2005). This preliminary analysis seeks to explore
the link between social pragmatic language and internalizing symptoms
(e.g. depression and anxiety).
Participants and Methods: The current study used data from 51 participants who participated in a research study involving a two hour
individual cognitive assessment, self-reports and history questionnaire.
The Behavioral Assessment System for Children, 2nd Edition (BASC-2)
was used as a self-report measure of children’s adaptive and problem
behaviors as assessed by children and their parents.The Supralinguistic composite of The Comprehensive Assessment of Spoken Language
(CASL) and Test of Problem Solving (TOPS) Making Inferences scale
were used to measure social language abilities. Hierarchical regressions
using bootstrapping were utilized to investigate the relationship between social pragmatic ability and reported internalizing symptoms
in children.
Results: The Supralinguistic composite (b = 0.40, t(43) = 2.45 p =
0.018) and TOPS scale (b = -0.47, t(43) = -2.71 p = 0.01) both significantly predicted parent reported depressive symptoms (R2 =.20,
F(4, 44) = 2.81, p = .037). Only the TOPS scale (b = -0.31, t(46) =
-2.27 p = 0.03) was significant for predicting child reported depressive
symptoms (R2 =.20, F(4, 47) = 2.812, p = .037). Anxiety symptoms
were not significantly related to social pragmatics.
Conclusions: Findings indicated that social language abilities were
related to both parent and child report of depressive symptoms when
controlling for gender and intelligence. However, social language and
anxiety were not significantly related. This could be due to the limited
sample size.

Alexithymia, Apathy, and Depressive Symptoms: Convergence and
Divergence.
Objective: Apathy, alexithymia, and depressive symptoms are difficult
to disentangle due to shared features. All three constructs are common
in neurologic illness. The objective of this study was to determine areas
of convergence and distinctiveness in these constructs.
Participants and Methods: Data were gathered using Amazon’s online
Mechanical Turk (MTurk). Participants (n = 624, ages 18-81; M = 36,
SD = 13) completed the 20-Item Toronto Alexithymia Scale (TAS-20;
Bagby et al., 1994), the Apathy Evaluation Scale (AES; Marin, 1991),
and the Center for Epidemiologic Studies – Depression Scale (CES-D;
Radloff, 1977) in a randomly counterbalanced order.

263
Results: TAS-20, AES, and CES-D scores were significantly correlated
(rs = .50 to .62, ps < .001). Exploratory factor analyses (with oblique
rotation) of all items revealed the best fit was a 3-factor solution of
alexithymia, apathy, and depressive symptoms. Some items loading
most strongly on the apathy factor had moderate secondary loadings
on the depressive factor (e.g, loss of motivation, interest, and initiative).
Items most unique to the apathy factor pertained to lack of positive
emotions. Some items loading most strongly on the depressive factor had
moderate secondary loadings on the apathy factor (e.g., sad, depressed,
and lonely). Items most unique to the depressive factor were crying,
fearfulness, poor appetite, and restless sleep. Most alexithymia items
had moderate cross-loadings with the apathy or depressive factors or
had low loadings on all factors.
Conclusions: Careful analysis of symptom convergence and divergence
will help clinical neuropsychologists differentiate between apathy, alexithymia, and depressive symptoms and will allow for most accurate
modeling of brain-behavior associations. Apathy was most uniquely
associated with lack of positive emotions. Anxiety and changes in sleep
and appetite were specific to the depressive factor. Alexithymia was least
likely to have variance unique from depressive symptoms and apathy.

J.R. VANUK, R. SMITH, S. KNIGHT & W.D. KILLGORE. Resting
RSA Correlates with Coordinated Resting State Activity Between
Brain Networks Involved in Emotional Perception.
Objective: A region encompassing the rostral anterior cingulate cortex
(rACC) and adjacent medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) is thought to be
a critical hub within a network subserving concept-level recognition of
emotions. Evidence suggests that rACC/MPFC activation is negatively
correlated with arousal level and positively correlated with Respiratory
Sinus Arrhythmia (RSA), which has been proposed as an index of parasympathetic influence over the body. Based on the idea that emotion
recognition may reduce arousal, we hypothesized that higher levels of
RSA at rest would be associated with greater resting state functional
connectivity between rACC/MPFC and other regions relevant to network-level concept representation.
Participants and Methods: Twenty-three healthy adults (12 males;
Mean: 21.61 years) had RSA recorded at rest for five minutes prior to
a six-minute resting state functional connectivity neuroimaging scan.
A region of interest encompassing the rACC/MPFC and parcellated regions of the cortex was interrogated using the CONN toolbox in SPM12.
Functional connectivity was examined between the rACC/MPFC and
two sets of a priori hypothesized cortical and subcortical regions (p <
.05, FDR corrected).
Results: Two models were tested, one investigating areas implicated
in the generation of emotional/autonomic reactions and the other targeting areas associated with concept-level emotion recognition. Higher
levels of baseline RSA were associated with significantly correlated activity between the rACC/MPFC and cortical regions associated with
concept-representation, most prominently the Superior Temporal Poles,
right Parahippocampal Gyrus, and left Supramarginal Gyrus.
Conclusions: Findings suggest that between-subject variance in RSA
at rest is associated with variance in resting state connectivity between
rACC/MPFC and regions associated with network-level concept representation. These patterns of functional connectivity may reflect an
adaptive relationship between emotion recognition and increased vagal
control.

Greater Resting State Functional Connectivity within the Default
Mode and Task Positive Networks is Associated with Trait
Emotional Intelligence.
Objective: Emotional intelligence (EI) is defined as the ability to accurately perceive, understand, utilize, and regulate emotion in oneself and
others; to facilitate the ability to solve emotionally driven intricacies.
Some evidence suggests the ability to shift flexibly between internal and
external focus may involve healthy emotional capacities. Accordingly,
we hypothesized that an individual’s self reported level of EI would
correlate with inverse connectivity relationships between areas related
to self-reflective processing and internal focus (Default Mode Network;
DMN) and external environmental focus (Parietal Task Positive Network; P-TPN), as mediated by the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC).
Participants and Methods: Sixty healthy adults (30 females; Mean
age: 30.4 years) completed the Bar-On Emotional Quotient Inventory
and a six-minute resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging
(fMRI) scan at 3T. Bilateral regions of interest were placed in the PCC,
along with individual regions of interest placed in regions of the parietal
cortex and the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) as defined by
the Automated Anatomical Labeling Atlas. Functional connectivity was
analyzed utilizing the CONN toolbox and SPM12. All correlations approached significance at p<.06, with results FDR-seed-level-corrected.
Results: EI was associated with anticorrelated functional connectivity
between the PCC and several parietal regions (i.e., P-TPN) but correlated positively with increased functional connectivity between the
PCC and left vmPFC (i.e., DMN).
Conclusions: Self-rated emotional intelligence was associated with inverse resting state connectivity between TPN and DMN areas. The results suggest that one component of higher EI may involve the flexibility
of transition between engagement with external stimuli and cognitive
states involving internal self-reflective focus.

J. WADE, R.P. HART, J.H. WADE, J. BEKENSTEIN, C. HAM
& J.S. BAJAJ. The Relationship Between Marital Status and
Happiness in Neurological Illness.
Objective: Adversarial growth describes the notion that positive change
occurs when individuals are confronted by significant loss. We examined
the notion that spousal loss in neurological patients would be associated
with higher levels of subjective well-being. In examining the relationship between marital status and happiness we controlled for decline in
intellectual ability and current level of physical functioning.
Participants and Methods: Fifty-four patients, between the ages of
16 to 73 years, completing an average of 14 years of education were
included. Forty-two were Caucasian, and 32 were women. Twelve were
single, 29 married, 6 divorced, and 7 were widowed. The most frequent
neurological diagnoses were cerebrovascular disease (N=26), followed
by hypoxia (N=7), seizure disorder (N=6), and multiple sclerosis (N=6).
The Pemberton Happiness Index, Interpersonal Support Evaluation
List-Short Form, Short Questionnaire to Assess Health-Enhancing
Physical Activity, Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence–2, and
the Wechsler Test of Adult Reading were administered.
Results: After controlling for physical activity level, decline from premorbid intellectual ability, age, and ethnicity, marital status was related
to happiness (P = .009). Widows experienced significantly higher levels
of happiness compared to married subjects (P = .035). Neurological
diagnosis P= .384) and the interaction of neurological diagnosis with
marital status (P = .129) were not significant. Sex (P= .788) and the
interaction of sex with marital status (P = .505) were not significant. The
marital groups did not differ in terms of the amount of social support
(P = .143) they received.
Conclusions: The findings indicate that after experiencing the trauma
of loss, the surviving partner may develop adversarial growth. Being
confronted by, and forced to adapt to one of life’s greatest losses, may

protect against negative emotional states in the face of future lifestyle
threat.

C. WILLIAMS, E. CRAUN, M. JESSER & M.M. WONG. Parents’
Anxiety Indirectly Predicts Children’s Executive Functioning.
Objective: Rates of anxiety are higher between parents and offspring
than between adults and unrelated children. Anxiety can also interfere
with executive functioning performance, particularly by interrupting
attention. This research proposes a mediational model whereby parents’
levels of anxiety indirectly influences children’s executive functioning
by predicting children’s levels of anxiety.
Participants and Methods: Forty children (42.5% female) and their
biological parents completed diagnostic screening interviews and a battery of executive functioning measures as part of a larger study on the influence of factors such as sleep, parental substance abuse, and emotional
functioning on children’s emotional and social development. Children’s
ages ranged from 8 to 13 (M = 11.00, SD = 1.26). Symptoms endorsed
under the general anxiety disorder (GAD) modules of the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview were used as a proxy for anxiety
and perseverative worry, which was used to predict neuropsychological
measures that assess attention (i.e., Trails of the D-KEFS; nonverbal
working memory tasks of the Stanford-Binet Intelligence Scale, 5th
ed.; verbal working memory tasks of the Stanford-Binet Intelligence
Scale, 5th ed.).
Results: Mediation models using MacKinnon’s PRODCLIN analysis
revealed that children’s GAD symptoms significantly mediated the relationship between adult GAD symptoms and children’s performance on
the nonverbal working memory tasks (LL: 0.071, UL: 2.701), but the
mediation was not significant when predicting verbal working memory
(LL: -.528, UL: 1.044) or Trails (LL: -0.959, UL: 1.362).
Conclusions: Contrary to prediction but consistent with the Yerkes-Dodson law, parents’ anxiety levels may selectively improve children’s performance by moderately increasing vigilance and attentiveness during
certain tasks. Results are contrasted with previous findings on this topic.

R.J. FEE, E.B. LEAFFER, M. VEGA VILLAR & V.J. HINTON. Parental
report on the BRIEF does not distinguish performance on clinical
measures of executive function in boys with Dystrophinopathy.
Objective: Dystrophinopathies are progressive genetic diseases characterized by muscle degeneration and cognitive deficits due to an abnormal
expression of the protein dystrophin in both muscle and brain. Verbal
working memory has been identified as a specific area of weakness for
boys with dystrophinopathy, and shown to contribute to academic performance. Parents report executive difficulties in the boys. We examined
whether those characterized by their parents as having poor executive
functions identifies those who perform poorly on measures of working
memory and/or executive function.
Participants and Methods: 41 boys with Dystrophinopathy, 5-17
years of age, diverse ethnicity and SES, were included. Measures: NIH
Toolbox, Executive Functioning: Flanker Test (FT) and Dimensional
Change Card Sort Test (DCCT); Working Memory: List Sorting Working Memory Test (LSWMT); Parent Ratings: Behavior Rating Inventory
of Executive Function (BRIEF). Two groups were created based on
clinical ratings cut at T > 67 on BRIEF scales. A one-way (2 group)
ANOVA for each BRIEF subscale was run for each cognitive measure.

Forty Fourth Annual INS Meeting Abstracts
Results: There were no between groups differences on the working
memory and executive measures across the subscales of the BRIEF
(Behavior Regulation Index: FT F(1, 34)=.92, DCCT F(1, 34)=1.55,
LSWMT F(1, 34)=2.38; Metacognition Index: FT F(1, 34)=1.13, DCCT
F(1, 34)=.43, LSWMT F(1, 34)=.70; Global Executive Composite: FT
F(1, 38)=1.69, DCCT F(1, 38)=.24, LSWMT F(1, 38)=1.19).
Conclusions: Parental report of executive dysfunction on the BRIEF
does not distinguish performance on standardized clinical measures of working memory and/or executive functioning in boys with
dystrophinopathy.

M.P. FISCHER, P.J. ORCHARD, W. MILLER, G. RAYMOND,
A. MCKINNEY & J. EISENGART. Neuropsychological Profile and
Initial Treatment Outcomes in a Child with Beta-Mannosidosis.
Objective: β-mannosidosis is an extremely rare lysosomal storage disorder (approximately 20 individuals described) with varying progressive
symptoms, including intellectual disability, speech impairment, hyperactivity, hearing loss, hypotonia, and skeletal deformities. A standard
treatment is not defined, but based on experience with other lysosomal
disorders, allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) was theorized to halt disease progression. We present neuropsychological and
imaging data related to disease and HCT outcomes in a 4-year-old male.
Participants and Methods: The patient has a history of developmental
delays and autism spectrum disorder (ASD), macrocephaly, and hypomyelination. Clinical data including neuropsychological evaluations and
brain imaging were reviewed before and after HCT.
Results: Initial testing showed average quantitative and nonverbal
fluid reasoning, working memory, and multimodal learning, but below average language and fine-motor speed. Five months after HCT,
testing was complicated by fatigue and significant speech and motor
decline (diagnoses of ataxia and dysarthria). Nonverbal fluid reasoning
and multimodal learning continued to be average, while knowledge
was below average. Imaging abnormalities that were not significantly
changed after HCT showed diffuse deep and subcortical white matter
hypomyelination that relatively spared the basal ganglia and thalami
(except the internal capsules) and the brainstem (except the medial
lemnisci dorsally).
Conclusions: The patient’s history of developmental delays, speech
difficulties, and abnormal imaging are consistent with β-mannosidosis
literature, while his features of ASD and areas of average cognitive
functioning are unusual. To our knowledge, this is the first patient to
receive HCT for this rare disorder. Initial treatment response includes
motor and speech decline, and some unchanged neurocognitive functioning. Follow-up evaluation will be crucial to characterize outcomes.

L. HAMPTON & R.S. ZIEGLER. Association of Russell-Silver
Syndrome Phenotype and Autism Spectrum Disorder: A Review
of Two Case Studies.
Objective: Russell Silver Syndrome (RSS) is a growth disorder with a
heterogeneous genetic, physical and cognitive presentation. Previous
research suggests that heritable RSS includes symptoms consistent with
Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). We present case reviews of two unrelated males with the RSS phenotype without genetic evidence.
Participants and Methods: Patient A was a 4-year, 8-month old male
with complex developmental and physical concerns diagnosed with
RSS based upon clinical presentation of intrauterine growth restriction
(IUGR), growth delays, facial gestalt, and café au lait macules. Patient B
was a 5-year, 11-month old male diagnosed with RSS based upon clinical presentation of early failure to thrive, prominent head size, crowded
dentition, limb length discrepancy, and café-au-lait macules. Genetic

265
testing was negative across cases. Comprehensive neurodevelopmental
assessment was completed in association with parent rating measures
of behavioral and adaptive functioning.
Results: Patient A’s overall neurodevelopmental performance yielded
impairment across multiple domains, including cognitive skills, language development, motor skills, adaptive skills, and social functioning.
There was also concern regarding symptoms consistent with ASD, including repetitive and restricted behaviors, severe language impairment,
and limited interest in toys or cooperative play. Patient B presented with
a neuropsychological profile in the below average to average range, with
difficulties seen in fine motor skills, visual spatial/visual reasoning skills,
and attention. ASD symptoms were not indicated by clinical observations, parent report or clinical history.
Conclusions: The results highlight the heterogeneity of RSS and suggest that symptoms of ASD may present in children without genetic
correlates. Findings emphasize the need for further clarification in the
neuropsychological profiles of RSS.

L. HAMPTON, N. SMILEY & R.S. ZIEGLER. Neuropsychological
Outcome Across Phenotypes in Sialic Acid Storage Disease: Case
Review of Two Affected Male Siblings.
Objective: Sialic Acid Storage Disease (SASD) is an autosomal recessive
lysosomal storage disorder characterized by cognitive and motor impairment associated with demyelination in cerebral white matter. Phenotypic presentations (Infantile SASD, Salla Disease, and sialuria) vary in
severity, with the infantile form the most severe. The present case review
focused on the clinical presentation of SASD in two affected siblings.
Participants and Methods: Two male siblings, ages 4 years and 8
months, presented with SASD. Patient A (age 4 years 1 month) was
diagnosed with Salla disease at approximately 2.5 years of age following presentation of nystagmus as well as early motor and language
delays. At the time of evaluation, he was unable to walk independently
and language was limited to one word. Patient B (age 8 months) was
diagnosed with infantile SASD in utero and demonstrated early motor
delays. Language development was within normal limits. Comprehensive neurodevelopmental assessment was completed in association with
parent rating measures of adaptive functioning.
Results: Patient A’s overall neurodevelopmental performance was
within the impaired range, with greatest deficits demonstrated in the
domains of expressive language and gross motor functioning. Results
of direct testing were consistent with parent ratings of his adaptive
functioning. Patient B presented with average cognitive development,
with discrepancy between his low average language skills and impaired
motor skills. Parent ratings of adaptive functioning were commensurate
with testing
Conclusions: Both siblings presented with motor delays characteristic
of SASD. Contrary to the existing literature, the presentation of infantile SASD in this study was not associated with significant impairment
across domains. Findings suggest that longitudinal neurodevelopmental
evaluation is required to establish a consistent neuropsychological profile for each disease phenotype.

D. HARLEY, A. KARYDAS, G. COPPOLA, J. YOKOYAMA, M. WYNN
& J.H. KRAMER. Influence of CETP on Executive Functioning in
Healthy Aging Adults.
Objective: The cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) plays a key
role in lipid pathways. Studies of the gene regulating CETP suggest that
homozygosity may be associated with longevity and better memory.
Despite the gene’s putative role in vascular health and the established
connection between cerebrovascular disease and executive functioning,

266
the relationship between CETP and executive functioning is poorly understood. Our objective was to test the hypothesis that healthy older
adults who are homozygous for the CETP would have better executive
functions than heterozygotes.
Participants and Methods: We studied 197 functionally intact older
controls from the UCSF Memory and Aging Center (mean age=72; mean
MMSE=29). Factor scores for executive functioning, episodic memory,
and processing speed were derived from a comprehensive neuropsychological battery. The cohort was divided into those who were homozygous for the CETP gene (A/A or G/G; n= 105) and those who were
heterozygous (A/G; n=92).
Results: There were no demographic differences between the groups.
GLM analyses showed that the homozygous group performed significantly better than the heterozygous group on executive functioning (F
(1,195)=6.419, p=.012) but not episodic memory (p>.9) or processing
speed (p>.10) A follow-up analysis showed that controlling for whole
brain white matter volumes, an MRI marker of cerebrovascular health,
did not alter the relationship between CETP and executive functioning.
Conclusions: This study highlights that in healthy aging, a gene regulating a lipid pathway protein is associated with better executive functioning with an advantage of homozygosity over heterozygosity. We
further found that this effect is specific to executive functioning, with
no relationship found for processing speed or memory. The relationship
between the gene and executive functioning was not mediated by white
matter volumes, indicating that further work is needed to understand
how the gene might influence cognition.

E.B. LEAFFER, J. SAMPSON, S. ASSURAS, V. LABODE &
V.J. HINTON. Reversal of cognitive decline in a case of myotonic
dystrophy treated for sleep problems.
Objective: To examine benefit of treatment for sleep apnea in a patient
with myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) who presented with symptoms
suggestive of a neurodegenerative pathology. DM1 is a dominantly inherited, tri-nucleotide repeat disorder with multisystemic involvement,
including progressive muscle weakness, myotonia, cognitive deficits,
fatigue, hypersomnolence, cardiac and vision problems. Patients are
often not correctly diagnosed due to the variety of manifesting symptoms. DM1 patients report the most debilitating aspects of the disorder
are fatigue and sleepiness, with 91.5% of adults reporting excessive
daytime sleepiness. The cognitive phenotype of DM1 includes deficits in
attention, executive and visuospatial function. We believe the attention
and executive deficits are likely secondary to symptoms of sleepiness
in DM1, and treatment of the sleep-related symptoms may result in
improved cognitive performance.
Participants and Methods: A 57-year-old man with a reported 4-year
history of progressive cognitive deficits (forgetting details, repeating
himself, word finding difficulty, and inattention) and history of visual
disturbance was initially evaluated and given a diagnosis of Mild Cognitive Impairment consistent with possible dementia with Lewy bodies or
Alzheimer’s Disease. He was found to have DM1 after his daughter’s diagnosis, as well as sleep apnea. Follow-up neuropsychological examination was done after one year of consistent use of CPAP for sleep apnea.
Results: Significant improvements in attention, delayed verbal recall,
mental flexibility, and naming were observed, with no substantial
changes in visual memory. Anecdotally, the patient’s wife stated that
he “vastly improved” after being treated for sleep apnea.
Conclusions: The findings suggest that treatment of associated sleep
disturbance in patients with DM1 can have substantial benefits on
cognitive performance, particularly in areas of attention and executive
function, although may not improve etiologically specific visuospatial
disturbances.

BDNF Val66Met Polymorphism, Motor Learning and Intermanual
Transfer of Sensorimotor Skills : A Neurophysiological TMS Study.
Objective: Recent data suggest that the Val66Met polymorphism of
the BDNF gene can alter cortical plasticity, short-term motor learning
and intermanual transfer of procedural skill. Here, we investigated the
impact of the polymorphism on sensorimotor learning and intermanual
transfer with Rapid Tapping (RT), Precision Grip Strength (PGS) and
the Grooved Pegboard (GP) by comparing Val and Met groups’ performances to controls who performed the same tasks with their right
or left hand only.
Participants and Methods: 40 right-handed healthy adults (10 Val;
10 Met; 10 CR; 10 CL).
L1 consisted in 3 blocks of RT, PGS and GP with the left hand. R1 and
R2 each comprised 10 blocks of RT, PGS and GP with the right hand.
L1 was retested post-practice (L2). Val and Met groups performed L1,
R1, R2 and L2. CL group performed L1 and L2 conditions only. CR
group performed R1 and R2 conditions only.
MEP, SICI and IHI were measured with TMS over the left (LH) and
right (RH) M1 before and after practice.
Results: Repeated measures ANOVA were used to compare performances at time 1 and time 2 between groups.
Learning: Results showed significant effects of Time for the Val (t=2.64;
p<.05) and CR (t=3.75; p<.01) groups on RT, of Group (F=11.96;
p<.001) on PGS and Time (F=52.7; p<.001) on the GP.
Transfer: Results showed significant effects of Time (F=7.21; p<.05)
on the RT, and Time (F=16.08; p<.001) and Group (F=4.39; p<.05)
effects on the GP.
TMS: Results showed a significant effect of Time (F=5.01; p<.05) for
the SICI-LH. No effects were obtained for the CL group. The CR group
showed significant effects of Time for the MEP-LH (F=7.21; p<.05),
SICI-LH (F= 8.92; p<.05) and IHI (F=6.07; p<.05).
Conclusions: Val66met was associated with differences in sensorimotor
learning and did not alter intermanual transfer. The initial practice
with the left hand was associated with increased performances with the
right hand and the changes in cortical excitability associated with motor
practice were not present when participants practiced with both hands.

Y. STERN & S. BARRAL. Examining the association between
Apolipoprotein E-ε4 and self-reported sleep disturbances in nondemented older adults.
Objective: We aimed to examine the association between apolipoprotein E (APOE) and sleep disturbances in a large number of community-based older adults.
Participants and Methods: This is a cross-sectional study, from the
Washington Heights-Inwood Community Aging Project (WHICAP).
A total of 1,944 non-demented older adults took part in the study.
Sleep dysfunction was measured using sleep categories derived from
the RAND Medical Outcomes Study Sleep Scale. Genetic association between APOE-ε4 genotype and sleep disturbances was assessed using unadjusted linear regression models. Secondary analyses were conducted
adjusting for age, sex, education, ethnicity and body mass index (BMI).
Results: In the unadjusted model, individuals carrying the APOE-ε4
allele showed lower levels of snoring (β=-0.02, SE= 0.01, p =0.010) and
sleep apnea (β=-0.01, SE= 0.01, p =0.037) when compared to non-ε4
carriers. After covariates’ adjustment, ε4 carriers demonstrated stronger association with lower levels of both snoring (β=-0.02, SE= 0.01,
p=0.006), and sleep apnea (β=-0.01, SE= 0.01, p=0.018).

Forty Fourth Annual INS Meeting Abstracts
Conclusions: Our results suggest that APOE-ε4 is associated with
decreased problems in snoring and sleep apnea, in a large numer of
non-demented older adults. Levels of vitamin D might play a significant
role in this association. Further longitudinal research is needed in order
to shed more light on the biological mechanisms underlying the role of
APOE-ε4 gene in sleep’s pattern.

regional activity in resting state fMRI and cognitive performance.
Objective: Depression is a common comorbidity in HIV. Current literature suggests that both, depression and HIV infection are related to
altered brain and cognitive function. It remains unclear whether these
two conditions have interactions.
Participants and Methods: A total of 63 Polish males (10 HIV-seropositive (HIV+) depressed, 26 HIV+ non-depressed, 10 HIV-seronegative (HIV-) depressed and 17 HIV- nondepressed), were retained
for current preliminary analysis. Mean age was 38 years with 16 years
of education. Groups were comparable on demographic, illness- and
treatment-related variables. Depression was measured with CES-D. MRI
and R-fMRI was performed using 3T Siemens scanner with 32-channel
head coil, registering 41 slices at 240 time points with TR of 2 sec.
Following standard data preprocessing, we computed regional homogeneity (ReHo), a data driven method to examine local synchronization
of the dynamic BOLD time series. Standardized neuropsychological
tests constituting a comprehensive measure of cognitive functioning
were performed.
Results: 2 (HIV) by 2 (depression) ANOVA (cluster size=50 voxels;
p=0.01) presented that HIV+ depressed group showed interaction effect
of increased ReHo in left middle frontal gyrus (-38, 8, 50). Depression was associated with ReHo increases in left superior frontal gyrus
(-20, 68, 2), while HIV with ReHo decreases in medial frontal (-6,
48, 4), superior temporal (-48, 16, -12) and cingulate (-4, 22, 44)
gyri, and cuneus (-12, -80, 32) of left cerebrum. MANOVA indicated
no depression–HIV interaction on cognitive functions. Depressed vs.
nondepressed subjects showed decreased executive functioning. HIV+
vs. HIV- individuals performed worse on nonverbal fluency, verbal and
visuo-spatial memory tasks.
Conclusions: This study showed effect of depression–HIV interaction
on brain regional homogeneity. Depression and HIV were also associated with independent alterations suggesting simultaneous occurance
of additive and synergistic effects of the two factors on the brain and
cognition.

R.N. ROBBINS. Functional Assessment of HIV+ Adults in South
Africa: Utility of the Patients’ Assessment of Own Functioning
Questionnaire and Instrumental Activities of Daily Living Scale.
Objective: Effective screeners of neurocognition and functional impairment are crucial to assessing HIV-Associated Neurocognitive Disorders
(HAND) in primary health care and limited-resource settings such as
South Africa were prevalence rates of HAND remain high. Although
the IHDS may be an effective screener to capture gross neurocognitive
impairment, it is unclear whether it can effectively capture difficulties
in daily functioning. The Patients’ Assessment of Own Functioning
(PAOFI) and the Lawton and Brody Instrumental Activities of Daily

267
Living (IADLs) Scale Modified Version are widely used to assess functional impairment in the staging of HAND among populations in the
United States. However, their usefulness in South African populations
as potential screeners used in conjunction with the IHDS has yet to be
evaluated.
Participants and Methods: Sixty-seven Black South African HIV+
adults (84% female; mean age=32yrs [SD=6.1]; 79.5% not completing
high school) completed comprehensive neuromedical and neurocognitive
evaluations in which the IHDS, PAOFI, and IADL were administered.
Results: Forty-six percent of the sample was neurocognitively impaired
based on the IHDS, 18% demonstrated functional impairment based on
the PAOFI, and 0% on IADLs. A Fisher’s exact test revealed that the
percentage of PAOFI impaired participants was significantly higher in
the IHDS impaired group (p = .03; OR = 4.5, CI = 1.1, 18.5).
Conclusions: HIV+ adults that reported functional impairment were
4 times more likely to have neurocognitive impairment. These results
indicate that the PAOFI may be an appropriate measure to use in conjunction with the IHDS when screening for HAND in South Africa.
The modified IADL scale, however, failed to provide any additional
information. Future studies should evaluate the predictive utility of
the IHDS and PAOFI in conjunction to accurately screen for HAND.

R.N. ROBBINS, H. GOUSE, V. JONAH, M. ARCE RENTERÍA,
K. THOMAS & J. JOSKA. An Evaluation of the Construct Validity
of a Neuropsychology Tablet App for Lay Health Workers to Screen
for HAND in South Africa.
Objective: Tablet computers with touchscreens offer a new platform
to assess neurocognition. NeuroScreen is an Android tablet app with
eight embedded neuropsychological (NP) tests assessing the domains
of learning, memory, processing speed, attention, executive functions,
and motor functions. NeuroScreen was developed as a screening tool
for HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder (HAND) and for specific
administration by lay health workers in South Africa. It takes approximately 20 minutes to complete, is highly automated, does not require
paper, pencils, other equipment (e.g., stopwatch), or highly trained personnel to administer, and requires the use of standardized instructions.
This study examined the construct validity of each NeuroScreen subtest.
Participants and Methods: Sixty-four, black South African, HIV+
adults (51 female, 31.89 years of age on average), were administered
NeuroScreen by a lay health worker. Then, participants completed a
full NP battery, consisting of well-established paper-and-pencil tests,
administered by a trained research psychometrist.
Results: Pearson correlation coefficients were calculated between the
NeuroScreen tests and paper-and-pencil NP tests. We observed weak
to strong, statistically significant correlations between NeuroScreen and
paper-and-pencil tests tapping the domains of verbal memory (r=.36,
p<.01), processing speed (r=.34, p<.01; r=.56, p<.01; r=.57, p<.01),
attention (r=.34, p<.01; r=.23, p<.05), executive functions (r=.32,
p<.01), and motor functioning (r=.40, p<.01).
Conclusions: Preliminary psychometric evidence suggested that the
NeuroScreen tests tap the NP domains of memory, attention, processing
speed, executive functions, and motor speed. Although NeuroScreen
may be a useful tool to screen for HAND in clinical settings by lay health
workers, further research is needed to further evaluate the psychometric
properties of the app’s subtests and determine how well the app can
detect the neurocognitive impairment associated with HIV.

N.S. BANERJEE, G. IRONSON & B.E. LEVIN. Executive
Functioning, Coping and Depression in HIV.
Objective: Executive dysfunction and depression are common and disabling neuropsychological sequelae in HIV. Coping style is a cognitive
factor that has been shown to impact depression in HIV. This study
examined the relationship between executive functioning, coping style
and depression in HIV.
Participants and Methods: A diverse sample of 123 HIV+ asymptomatic individuals (Mage = 37.77; 67.5% male; 80% graduated high
school; 43% African American, 30% Hispanic) completed Trail Making
Test (TMT), BDI, and Brief COPE. Active and avoidant coping styles
were operationalized using subscales of the Brief COPE. A coping index
was computed by subtracting avoidant coping z-scores from active coping z-scores. An average BDI composite score was derived from multiple
time points.
Results: Controlling for age, gender, ethnicity, education, and CD4 cell
count, TMT B was related to BDI (β =.22, p =.02), avoidant coping (β =
.34, p < .01) and coping index (β = -.28, p < .01), but not active coping
(β = -.07, p =.51). Mediation analyses revealed that the effect of TMT
B on depression was mediated by avoidant coping. In the mediation
model (R2 =.22, F(7,111) = 4.33, p <.01), the effect of avoidant coping
on depression remained significant (β =.39, p < .01) while the effect
of TMT B did not (β =.09, p = .38). A separate analysis examining the
coping index confirmed the mediation model.
Conclusions: This study is one of the first to examine the relationship
between executive functioning and coping style in HIV. Our results suggest that executive dysfunction is associated with disproportional use of
avoidant coping, and that avoidant (maladaptive) coping is associated
with depression in HIV. These findings call attention to the influence of
cognitive functioning on coping style in HIV, and highlight the utility
of assessing executive function as an important correlate of emotional
well-being. HIV+ patients with executive dysfunction may benefit from
assessments and interventions targeting coping skills.

N.A. DASHER, P. VIK & D. HACHEY. Nonverbal versus Verbal
Learning and Memory in Asymptomatic HIV Patients.
Objective: Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) has been associated
with memory impairments characterized by slow encoding, poor retrieval, but generally intact recognition. However, much research examining this profile has relied on auditory or predominantly verbally
mediated material. Given evidence indicates that verbal and nonverbal
encoding and retrieval functions are in part linked to distinct brain
regions, it is plausible HIV may not uniformly impact these domains.
The present study directly compared verbal and nonverbal learning and
memory profiles in those with HIV.
Participants and Methods: Twenty-five HIV+ adults were compared
to an age-matched sample of 25 healthy adults. Both samples completed
the California Verbal Learning Test (CVLT-II), North American Adult
Reading Test (NAART), and Northwest Trail Test (NWTT), a nonverbal analog to the CVLT-II designed to measure learning and recall of
visuospatial information and minimize the impact of verbal mediation
during encoding.
Results: ANCOVAs, controlling for age, sex, and NAART, revealed that
those with HIV performed significantly worse on visuospatial learning
and recall (NWTT scores, all ps < .05) but did not statistically differ
from controls on measures of verbal learning and recall (CVLT scores,
all ps > .05). There were no significant differences in regard to verbal
or visuospatial recognition (all ps > .05).
Conclusions: HIV patients performed worse than controls on a measure of visuospatial memory that limits verbally mediated encoding
but performed similarly on a measure of verbal learning. The pattern
of performance resembled a subcortical profile, which is in accordance
with HIV’s affinity for compromising frontostriatal function. In addition, those infected were all receiving anti-retroviral therapy and were

relatively asymptotic (i.e., mean current and nadir T-cell counts above
200). Consequently, assessing for non-verbally mediated memory impairments in HIV patients could allow for earlier detection of neurocognitive risk and impact treatment options.

H.M. HOLDEN, E.E. MORGAN & P. GILBERT. Verbal Memory
Profiles in HIV-associated Neurocognitive Disorders: A
Comparison with Huntington’s Disease and Temporal Lobe
Epilepsy.
Objective: Up to 65% of individuals with HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND) evidence episodic memory impairment that
is characterized as a mixed encoding/retrieval profile consistent with a
“subcortical” presentation. The current study evaluated this hypothesis
by comparing the extent to which the pattern of HIV-associated episodic
memory deficits correspond with those of populations with traditional
subcortical (i.e., Huntington’s disease) versus cortical (i.e., temporal
lobe epilepsy) profiles.
Participants and Methods: Seventy-seven individuals with HAND, 47
with Huntington’s disease (HD), 21 with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE),
and 45 healthy participants who were matched on age, education, and
ethnicity were administered the California Verbal Learning Test - 2nd
Edition (CVLT-II). CVLT-II profiles were classified as reflecting a
primary encoding deficit (poor free recall and recognition, intrusion
errors), retrieval deficit (impaired acquisition and free recall but intact
recognition), or normal (i.e., intact acquisition, recall and recognition)
using the Massman et al. (1992) discriminant function algorithm.
Results: A logistic regression adjusting for sex revealed that group membership was a significant predictor of memory profile type (p<.01). The
HD group evidenced the lowest proportion of individuals with normal
profiles (13%), with HAND (38%) and TLE (38%) groups falling intermediate to the healthy group (78%). Among participants with a
CVLT-II deficit, the HAND group showed the highest rates of retrieval
versus encoding profiles (71% vs. 29%), followed by HD (59% vs.
41%), TLE (46% vs. 54%), and healthy (50% vs. 50%) groups.
Conclusions: Findings suggest that HIV-associated verbal memory impairments are most consistent with a traditional subcortical, retrieval
deficit profile. Nevertheless, there is significant profile heterogeneity
across clinical groups, which may reflect neuropathological variability,
measurement error, and/or the influence of secondary variables (e.g.,
cognitive and brain reserve).

K.L. DOYLE, S. WOODS, E.E. MORGAN, J. IUDICELLO &
M. CAMERON. The Effects of HIV-associated Neurocognitive
Disorders Across An Integrated Functional Model of Health
Literacy.
Objective: HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND) are associated with deficits in health literacy, a multifactorial construct encompassing abilities that are essential for making optimal health decisions. However, the impact of HAND across different functional levels
of health literacy is not known. The present study adopted Sorensen’s
(2012) integrative health literacy theory to examine the potential differential effects of HAND across core health literacy domains.
Participants and Methods: Thirty-seven HIV+ individuals with HAND
(HAND+) and 44 HIV+ individuals without HAND (HAND-) who were
matched on demographic, psychiatric, and HIV disease characteristics
completed standardized neuromedical, psychiatric, and neurocognitive
research evaluations, alongside a comprehensive health literacy battery
that assessed Sorensen’s (2012) core domains of motivation, knowledge,
competence, understanding, and appraisal/application.

Forty Fourth Annual INS Meeting Abstracts
Results: A mixed model ANOVA controlling for education revealed
a significant interaction between HAND and health literacy domains
(p<.01), such that the HAND+ group evidenced poorer scores than the
HAND- group within domains of knowledge, competence, understanding, and appraisal/application (ps<.05, Cohen’s d range=.64-1.23),
but not motivation (p>.05, Cohen’s d=.45). Within the HAND+ group,
deficits in these four domains were associated with worse performance
on measures of learning and executive function (ps<.01).
Conclusions: Findings suggest that individuals with HAND evidence
lower health literacy across some, but not all core domains, including
both lower- (e.g., knowledge) and higher-order (e.g., appraisal/application) abilities, all of which depend on learning and executive functions
(e.g., cognitive flexibility). Evaluation of established learning (e.g.,
spaced retrieval, interleaving) and executive function (e.g., goal-management training) strategies to enhance aspects of health literacy in
HIV may be warranted.

The Montreal Cognitive Assessment to Screen for HIV-associated
Neurocognitive Disorders in Older Adults: Sensitivity, Specificity,
and External Validity.
Objective: Given the increased incidence and prevalence of HIV among
older adults, and the heightened risk for cognitive impairment in this
population, brief cognitive screening tools are needed to identify those
who require a comprehensive neuropsychological (NP) evaluation.
Participants and Methods: We examined the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) to identify HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders
in 100 older adults (≥50 years) with HIV. Participants completed the
MoCA, along with a comprehensive “gold-standard” (GS) battery (NP,
daily functioning, and neuromedical assessments). GS NP impairment
was classified via clinical ratings using Frascati criteria. Using receiver
operating characteristic curve analyses (ROC), the area under the curve
(AUC) was calculated for the most optimal MoCA cut-point, balancing
sensitivity and specificity. We then compared the MoCA Impaired vs.
MoCA Normal groups on several demographic, HIV-disease, psychiatric,
and everyday functioning variables.
Results: ROC analysis revealed a MoCA cut-point of ≤26 as the most
optimal balance of sensitivity (84.2%) and specificity (55.8%), with an
AUC value of 0.70 (p < 0.01); the positive predictive value was 71.6%,
the negative predictive value was 72.7%, and the accuracy was 72%.
The MoCA Impaired group (67% of sample) had a greater number of
instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) (p=0.03) and cognitive
(p = 0.04) complaints, and greater percent of IADL Dependence (37%
vs. 15%; p=0.02) than the MoCA Normal group. The MoCA groups did
not differ on clinico-demographic factors.
Conclusions: A derived MoCA cut-point yielded good sensitivity, but
suboptimal specificity, in detecting NP impairment among older adults
with HIV. Participants identified as impaired by the MOCA showed
greater daily functioning difficulties suggesting that the MoCA may
serve as an adequate cognitive screener until instruments with greater
specificity are developed.

K. HESTAD. The Use of Neuropsychological Tests in assessing
HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders in Zambia.
Objective: To determine the applicability of a comprehensive Western
developed neuropsychological (NP) test battery with Zambian norms
in distinguishing clade C HIV positive (HIV+) participants on antiretroviral therapy (ART) from healthy HIV negative (HIV-) controls and
to study how HIV infection inflicts on neurocognitive performance. It is
estimated that 13 percent of adults in Zambia are infected with HIV and

269
yet like most countries in sub-Saharan Africa, Zambia has no specific
test that measures HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders.
Participants and Methods: This was a cross-sectional study carried
out in Urban Zambia a country located in Sub-Saharan Africa. The
study comprised 266 HIV+ participant recruited from six urban clinics
that routinely offer ART; these were compared to a previously collected
sample of 324 HIV- controls. NP performance was assessed using demographically corrected for T-scores with a mean of 50 (SD=10) and
Global Deficit Scores (GDS) were used to assess impairment levels.
Participants were considered impaired if they had a deficit score of ≥0.5.
Results: HIV+ participants performed worse (Mean=46.28, SD=5.66)
than the HIV-controls (Mean=49.77, SD=5.14) t (588) =7.826
p=<.001 Cohen’s d effect size .64 and GDS confirms the same, (HIV+
Mean=.460, SD=.50 (HIV- Mean=.249, SD=.27) t (392.03) = -6.15
p=<.001 Cohen’s d effect size .52. The impairment levels of the HIV+
sample was at 34.6%.
Conclusions: Results obtained confirmed that the Western developed
NP test battery, using local norms is applicable in Zambia. This is
an important finding for Zambia because it offers a viable means of
assessing HIV-associated cognitive disorders in this resource limited
country ravaged by HIV.

R. KAMAT, S. WOODS, M. CAMERON & J. IUDICELLO. Apathy
Is Associated with Lower Mental and Physical Quality of Life in
Persons Infected with HIV.
Objective: Relative to the general population, HIV-infected individuals
consistently report lower levels of health-related quality of life (HRQoL),
which is a multidimensional concept that characterizes an individual’s
well-being across physical, mental, emotional and social functioning.
The extent to which apathy, a sequela of HIV infection, plays a key role
in lower HRQoL in HIV disease remains undetermined, as the only two
existing studies on this topic have produced mixed results. Thus, this
study investigated the role of apathy in mental and physical HRQoL in
the context of biologic, psychiatric, and functional factors.
Participants and Methods: Eighty HIV+ individuals completed a
comprehensive neuromedical and neurobehavioral evaluation, which
included the RAND SF-36, a self-report measure of mental and physical
HRQoL. Current apathy was measured using a composite of the apathy
subscale of the Frontal Systems Behavioral Scale and the vigor-activation subscale of the Profile of Mood States.
Results: A series of multiple regressions indicated that apathy was a
significant independent predictor of lower physical (β= -.46, p<.001)
and mental HRQoL (β= -.47, p<.001), even while controlling for major depressive disorder, neurocognitive impairment, functional status,
and current CD4 count. The only other significant predictors of lower
physical and mental HRQoL were lower CD4 counts (β= .25, p=.01)
and a history of depression (β= .20, p=.05), respectively.
Conclusions: These findings provide support for Wilson & Cleary’s

M. CAMERON. Prospective Memory Is Related To Job Performance
in Persons With HIV Infection.
Objective: Prospective memory (PM; i.e. remembering to remember)
influences how individuals are able to function efficiently in many real-world behaviors and has previously been associated with employment status in HIV disease. The present study extends this literature by

270
examining whether HIV-associated deficits in PM are associated with
self-perceived performance in the workplace as a function of increased
work responsibility, which was hypothesized to amplify the effects of
PM on performance.
Participants and Methods: The sample was comprised of 48 individuals with HIV infection who were administered a comprehensive
neuropsychological test battery, including the Memory for Intentions
Screening Test (MIST) and Prospective and Retrospective Memory
Questionnaire (PRMQ). Participants also completed a 12-item questionnaire that assessed work performance over the past month. Participants
were also classified as to whether work-related responsibility had increased (n=15) or decreased/not changed (n=33). These two subgroups
did not differ on any demographic, psychiatric, or HIV disease factors,
including the prevalence of HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders
(all ps>0.05).
Results: Given the non-normal distributions of the study variables,
Spearman rank –order correlations were conducted to assess the relationship between the work performance and PM measures. In HIV+ participants who reported increased responsibilities, work performance was
strongly related to environmentally-cued PM symptoms on the PRMQ
(rho=0.67) and the naturalistic 24-hr delay (rho=0.63) item on the
MIST. No significant relationships between PM and work performance
were present in the HIV+ group who did not report increased responsibilities (ps>0.10).
Conclusions: These preliminary findings suggest that PM’s role in
workplace performance in HIV-infected persons may vary as a function
of changes in work-related demands.

A.D. THAMES. The Effects of HIV and Aging on Subcortical Shape
Alterations: A 3D Morphometric Study.
Objective: Prior neuroimaging studies have demonstrated extensive
atrophy of subcortical structures among individuals with HIV. However,
to our knowledge, no study has investigated the role of aging on morphometrically specific subcortical shape alterations in a sample of HIV+
and HIV-seronegative individuals. Measures of subtle neurostructural
differences have potential for use in clinical diagnosis as well as tracking
disease-related change over time.
Participants and Methods: Structural MRI/3D morphometry methods
were used to compare subcortical structures between HIV+ individuals
(n = 59) and HIV-seronegative (n = 20) controls. We examined the
effects of HIV-infection, recent CD4 count and HIV viral load on shape
differences in the nucleus accumbens, amygdala, caudate, hippocampus,
pallidum, putamen and thalamus. We also examined age effects on
subcortical shape alterations within our HIV status groups.
Results: Significant between-group differences were found in the shape
of the right caudate and nucleus accumbens as well as the left pallidum and hippocampus, indicating that HIV-serostatus is associated
with subcortical shape abnormalities (i.e. thinning, shrinking) in these
structures. Within the HIV+ group, recent CD4 count was associated
with shape alterations in left thalamus, nucleus accumbens and bilateral caudate while viral load was associated with altered shape of the
right pallidum. Additionally, increasing age was associated with shape
abnormalities in numerous structures within both HIV status groups.
Finally, the interactive effect of HIV and age also significantly related
to subcortical shape change. Importantly, these associations were significant after controlling for recent CD4 count and HIV viral load.
Conclusions: These results are consistent with our knowledge of HIV
effects on subcortical neurodegeneration, which in the context of advancing age may place HIV+ individuals at increased risk for cognitive
compromise.

MINDT. The Roles of Health Literacy, Neuropsychological
Functioning, and Demographics in Health Disparities among
HIV+ Adults.
Objective: Latino individuals living with HIV have worse health outcomes than their non-Hispanic White counterparts. The present study
investigated disparities in health literacy, neuropsychological (NP) performance, and education in order to better understand disparities in
health outcomes between White and Latino HIV+ adults.
Participants and Methods: One hundred twenty-nine HIV+ Latino
(n= 92) and White (n= 37) adults (69% Male; M Age=48 years [SD=8];
M Education=13 years [SD=3]) completed the Test of Functional Health
Literacy in Adults (TOFHLA), and comprehensive NP and neuromedical (HIV viral load count) evaluations.
Results: Latino adults had significantly lower levels of health literacy,
global NP performance, and education, and significantly higher HIV
viral loads than White adults (all p’s<.05). A logistic regression model
investigating the effects of health literacy, NP performance, education,
and ethnicity on the likelihood that participants had undetectable viral
loads was significant (X2(4)=13.14, p<.05), and explained 8% of the
variance in viral load category. However, health literacy was the only
significant predictor (p<.05), and higher health literacy was associated
with an increased likelihood of having undetectable viral load.
Conclusions: Consistent with research documenting health disparities
between Latino and white HIV+ adults, Latino participants in this study
had higher HIV viral loads than their White counterparts, suggesting
less well managed disease and worse health outcomes. Concurrently,
Latino participants had lower levels of health literacy, NP performance,
and education than White participants. Of these variables, only health
literacy was a significant predictor of undetectable viral load. This is
notable as health literacy is a modifiable variable that may contribute
to the goal of minimizing health disparities across ethnically diverse
groups in regards to HIV treatment outcomes.

P. GILBERT, J. IUDICELLO, I. GRANT & M. CAMERON. HIVseropositive Individuals are at Risk for Misattributing the Source
of Health-Related Information.
Objective: Health illiteracy is common in HIV infection (HIV+), particularly among persons with neurocognitive disorders. Source memory,
or memory for the context in which information was learned, is also
impaired in HIV and may play an important role in the acquisition and
credibility of health-related information. This study evaluated the effect
of HIV on item and source memory for novel health-related information.
Participants and Methods: Thirty-eight HIV+ and 16 demographically-comparable HIV- participants completed a health-related source
memory task in which 16 facts about a hypothetical new disease were
randomly paired with one of four sources (i.e., doctor, pharmacist,
friend, neighbor) and shown sequentially on a computer. Participants
were randomly assigned into either an experimental condition in which
they were instructed to attend to the source of the facts or a control condition in which no source instructions were provided. After a 10-minute
delay, a 32-item recognition trial (16 targets,16 foils) assessed both item
(i.e., disease facts) and source (e.g., doctor) memory.
Results: A mixed-model ANOVA revealed an interaction of HIV, condition, and memory type (p<.05). Follow-up analyses revealed no effects
on item memory, yet for source memory the HIV+ persons instructed
to attend to the source scored better than HIV+ controls (p<.05); in
contrast, there was no effect of source instructions in the HIV- group
(p>.10). An error analysis suggests that HIV+ individuals were more
likely to misattribute disease facts to health professionals when the
correct source was a lay-person (p<.05).
Conclusions: This study demonstrated that HIV+ individuals are at risk
for mistaking the source of newly learned health-related information.
This type of misattribution error may be problematic or even dangerous

Behaviors Significantly Impact Everyday Functioning Outcomes
in HIV Disease and Methamphetamine (MA) Dependence.
Objective: HIV and MA use often co-occur and are associated with neurocognitive impairment (NCI), which is linked to everyday functioning
(EF) problems (e.g., unemployment). However, significant EF variance
with HIV and MA remains unaccounted for by NCI. Elevated frontal
systems behaviors (FSBs; i.e., apathy, impulsivity/disinhibition, and
sensation-seeking) are also prevalent and can impact EF. This study
examined the unique impact of FSBs on EF outcomes in HIV/MA, while
considering the effects of NCI.
Participants and Methods: Participants (N=180) were classified by
MA dependence (M+/M-) and HIV serostatus (H+/H-) into four groups:
H-M- (n=49), H-M+ (n=48), H+M- (n=45), and H+M+ (n=39). The
groups were similar in age and ethnicity (p>0.10), though the H-Mgroup had more females and the H-M+ group was less educated relative
to the other groups (ps<0.05). Participants completed a comprehensive
neuropsychological evaluation and self-report measures of FSBs and
EF outcomes [i.e., cognitive complaints (CCs), activities of daily living
(ADLs), and HIV transmission risk behaviors].
Results: Regression models predicting EF outcomes were significant (R2=0.33–0.45). FSBs accounted for significant variance in CCs
(ΔR2=0.09, p<0.001), ADLs (ΔR2=0.03, p=0.01), and HIV risk behaviors (ΔR2=0.10, p<0.001) beyond that accounted for by other significant
predictors (e.g., NCI, mood). Specifically, higher apathy and impulsivity/disinhibition significantly predicted increased CCs, problems with
ADLs, and HIV risk behaviors; while higher sensation-seeking predicted
increased HIV risk behaviors.
Conclusions: Findings demonstrate a significant association between
elevated FSBs and EF declines in HIV and MA, beyond the effects of
other common contributors to poorer functional outcomes in these risk
groups (e.g., NCI). Elucidating factors that may contribute to EF problems in HIV and MA is important given the considerable public health
implications. These results highlight FSB disturbances as important
targets for early detection and intervention.

I. GRANT & R.K. HEATON. Self-Reported Attribution of Everyday
Dysfunction: Defining Functional Dependence in HIV.
Objective: The current criteria for symptomatic versus asymptomatic
HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder (HAND; Antinori et al., 2007)
requires that clinicians evaluate 1) the presence of daily functioning
dependence (DFD; e.g., driving) and 2) if their DFD is attributable to
cognitive (e.g., cannot remember directions) or strictly physical (e.g.,
cannot see the road) problems. Many providers rely only on patient
self-report (SR) to evaluate these criteria. However, the validity of SR
may be limited (e.g., Blackstone et al., 2012). This study evaluated
the validity of SR DFD and causative attributions by examining the
similarities between SR variables and objective findings.
Participants and Methods: SR (questionnaires) and objective variables of daily functioning (e.g., employment), physical problems on

271
medical examinations, and cognitive deficits on neuropsychological
testing were compared between HIV+ DFD (n=501; >2 declines on the
ADL) and non-DFD (n=725) groups. Within the DFD group, the same
variables were evaluated between cognitive versus physical attributors.
Results: The DFD and non-DFD groups had similar demographics
but the DFDs had higher rates of AIDS, lower nadir CD4, and worse
performance on all objective physical, cognitive, and daily functioning
measures (ps<.01). Among DFD, physical versus cognitive attributors
had similar demographics, and did not differ on AIDS prevalence, or any
objective physical, cognitive, or daily functioning measures (ps>.01).
Conclusions: Results suggest that, while patients appear to accurately
report loss of independence in daily functioning, they may struggle to
identify the physical versus cognitive causes of such loss. The latter
distinction may require objective cognitive and physical examinations.

P. OLSEN, M. RIVERA MINDT, D.A. BYRD & S. MORGELLO. NonVerbal Ability As An Estimator Of Premorbid Intelligence: Does It
Remain Stable Among Ethnically Diverse HIV+ Adults?
Objective: The General Ability Measure for Adults (GAMA) is an established non-verbal measure of premorbid ability. However, its long-term
reliability is not well documented, particularly in diverse populations
with CNS-relevant disease. We examined test-retest reliability of the
GAMA over time in an ethnically diverse sample of HIV+ adults.
Participants and Methods: Participants (N= 79) completed a comprehensive neuropsychological battery, including the GAMA, on at least two
separate study visits. Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) were computed using scores from baseline and follow-up assessments to determine
the test-retest reliability of the GAMA across racial/ethnic groups and
across changes in medical (immunological) and clinical (neurocognitive) factors. Additionally, Fisher’s Z tests were used to determine the
significance of the differences between ICCs.
Results: The average test-retest interval was 47.2 months (SD= 29.9).
The overall GAMA test-retest reliability was satisfactory (r = .68, p <
.001), and remained robust across most demographic, medical, and
clinical variables (all r > .68). Intraclass correlation coefficients did not
differ significantly between the subgroups tests (all Fisher’s Z p’s > .05).
Conclusions: Overall, this study supports the appropriateness of nonverbal measures, such as the GAMA, for use as stable premorbid IQ
estimates among ethnically diverse groups. Moreover, this study supports the reliability of this measure in the context of change in health
and neurocognitive status, and in lengthy inter-test intervals. These
findings offer strong rationale for nonverbal tests, even in the presence
of a chronic, variable disease such as HIV.

Function in HIV+ Adults.
Objective: Socioeconomic status (SES) has been associated with disease
progression, comorbidity, and quality of life in HIV+ adults. SES and
home environment have been associated with neurocognitive function
in HIV+ children. However, the relationship between SES and neurocognitive function in HIV+ adults remains unclear. In this study, we
examined the relation between poverty and neurocognitive ability in
HIV+ adults while controlling for literacy, an estimate of premorbid
neurocognitive function.
Participants and Methods: Adults enrolled in the Drexel Medicine
CNS AIDS Research and Eradication Study (CARES) Cohort (N=158;
ages 26-71; 66% male; 97% on antiretroviral therapy) completed tests

272
of executive function, motor and psychomotor speed, language, episodic memory, and visuoconstruction. Word reading was used as an
estimate of premorbid neurocognitive function. Participants’ self-reported household income level was categorized according to U.S. federal
poverty guidelines; fifty-nine percent of the sample was at or below the
poverty line.
Results: Thirteen neurocognitive parameters adjusted for age, education, gender, and race were entered in multiple linear regression models
as a function of poverty, controlling for word reading. Poverty was
associated with reduced fine motor speed in the dominant hand (β=.24, p<.05) and was marginally associated with reduced performance
in delayed visual recognition memory (β=-.13, p=.09).
Conclusions: Individuals affected by poverty may be at a higher risk of
motor impairment, even when controlling for premorbid neurocognitive
ability, supporting the need for policies and resources to reduce poverty
among HIV+ persons. Future research should examine the mechanism
of the relation between poverty and motor impairment, and the effects
of other psychosocial hazards, such as those in the community environment, in HIV+ persons. NIH R01 NS32092, R01 DA19807, R01

Random Number Generation in HIV Disease.
Objective: HIV infection is commonly associated with dysregulation of
frontostriatal circuitry that frequently manifests as executive dysfunction. The present study evaluated whether HIV-infected individuals
evidence deficits in random number generation, which is an executively
demanding task requiring the paced, rule-guided production of single
digits.
Participants and Methods: Participants included 74 adults with HIV
disease and 54 seronegative comparison subjects with broadly comparable demographics who completed a comprehensive research neuropsychological battery. All participants were asked to verbally produce a
sequence of digits between 1 and 10 in a random fashion (i.e., avoiding
any order) for 100 seconds at a steady pace of 1 digit per second. Output
was scored for intrusions, repetitions, order seriation (e.g., 1-2-3-4), and
cycling (i.e., median length of gaps between repeating digits).
Results: Controlling for estimated verbal IQ, a series of multiple regressions showed that HIV disease was associated with significantly higher
levels of seriation and cycling (ps<.05, ds = 0.54, 0.48), but not errors or
repetitions (ps>.10). Within the HIV+ group, seriation was significantly
positively correlated with composite scores of auditory attention and verbal learning and memory, whereas cycling was significantly positively
correlated with verbal fluency (ps<.05, r range .30-.43).
Conclusions: HIV disease is associated with moderate difficulties in
the cognitively demanding process of inhibiting statistically unlikely
non-random sequences during a number generation task, which neuroimaging research shows is dependent on prefrontal systems. The pattern
of correlational findings suggests that higher non-randomness in the
HIV group may be indicative of underlying deficits in higher-order
verbal abilities (e.g., learning and fluency). The ecological relevance
of random number generation in HIV disease (e.g., health literacy)
remains to be determined.

J. VILLALOBOS, E.E. MORGAN, K.L. DOYLE, M. CAMERON,
I. GRANT & S. WOODS. Social Cognition is Associated with
Greater Conflict on Social Aspects of a Medical Decision-Making
Task.
Objective: Social cognition plays a pivotal role in navigating many
real-world activities, including aspects of healthcare (e.g., shared

decision-making). HIV is associated with mild deficits in social cognition, particularly on emotion-based tasks. The present study examined
the association between deficient social cognition and medical decision-making among people living with HIV.
Participants and Methods: 89 HIV-seropositive individuals completed
a comprehensive neurobehavioral battery, which included the Cogstate
Social-Emotional Cognition Task (SECT) and the Decisional Conflict
Scale (DCS). The SECT is a computerized task that assesses the emotional processing (i.e., facial affect discrimination) and theory of mind
aspects of social cognition. The DCS involves selecting a treatment option in response to a hypothetical medical decision-making scenario and
completing 16 items that measure self-perceptions of that treatment
decision. Given the non-normal distribution of the DCS, a dichotomous
(median split) independent variable representing “low conflict” (n=43)
versus “high conflict” (n=46) groups was used.
Results: DCS groups did not differ on demographic, psychiatric, HIV
disease, or global neurocognitive factors. Participants in the “high conflict” group scored significantly lower on SECT accuracy than participants in the “low conflict” group (p=.04; d=-0.41). Spearman’s rho
correlations revealed a significant association between the SECT and the
DCS social support subscale (rho=-0.3; p=.005) but not the DCS uncertainty, informed, values clarity, or effective decision subscales (ps>.05).
Conclusions: Our findings indicate that lower social cognition is associated with greater difficulty, or conflict, with medical decision-making
in HIV+ individuals. In particular, individuals with poorer social cognition may lack adequate social support to comfortably choose among
the available medical treatment options, which may put them at higher
risk of failing to consider the full array of potentially effective treatment
options.

of Viral Infections, Substance Use and Psychiatric Diagnosis to
Change in Memory over One Year in a Marginally Housed Sample.
Objective: People who reside in marginal housing often incur viral infections, psychiatric illness and substance use disorders that compromise
cognition. We identified the impact of various morbidities on change in
memory in a one-year longitudinal design.
Participants and Methods: Participants were recruited from single-room occupancy hotels and followed for one year (N = 226; 175
male; Mage = 45.42). Memory functioning was evaluated at baseline
and re-assessed at follow-up using alternate, counterbalanced versions
of the Hopkins Verbal Learning Test-Revised (HVLT-R). At baseline,
psychiatric diagnoses, HIV status and exposure to other viruses were
established. Depressive and psychotic symptoms were also assessed.
Substance use patterns were ascertained monthly via interview over
the follow-up duration. Acute substance use at the time of memory
assessment was detected by urinalysis.
Results: Hierarchical regression revealed that viral exposure contributed a significant amount of variance to change in HVLT-R scores, ΔR2
= .06, F(5, 220) = 2.78, p < .05, with this result being driven primarily
by HIV status, β = -.23, t = 3.32, p < .05. The HIV seropositive group
demonstrated a slight decrease in number of words recalled from baseline to follow-up (M = -1.26, SD = 5.57), in contrast to the seronegative group who demonstrated a relative improvement (M = 0.95, SD
= 5.31). Psychiatric factors did not emerge as significant predictors in
the current model of memory changes over one year, while substance
use contributed minimally.
Conclusions: In a sample of marginally housed individuals with comorbid viral infections, psychiatric illness and substance use, only viral
exposure substantially contributed to change in memory over one year.
Persons with HIV showed a decline in verbal memory in contrast to

Forty Fourth Annual INS Meeting Abstracts
seronegative persons. This suggests that future investigation of persons with multimorbidities may target the clinical management of HIV
infection, including plasma viral load, to determine its relevance to
neurocognitive trajectories.

E. WEBER, S. WOODS, Y. LI, I. GRANT, M.R. BASSO, P. GILBERT
& S. LOFT. Self-generation improves prospective memory
performance in HIV-infected adults.
Objective: Prospective memory (PM), or “remembering to remember”,
is frequently impaired in individuals with HIV infection and impacts
everyday functioning (e.g., medication adherence). Self-generation is a
potentially powerful approach to improve PM as it should strengthen
PM cue encoding and subsequent cue accessibility, reducing the strategic
demands of the PM task.
Participants and Methods: The present study examined whether
self-generated encoding improves PM among 56 HIV+ and 21 HIVadults. PM was assessed using a computer-administered variation of the
classic McDaniel & Einstein PM paradigm. Participants were administered a comprehensive neurocognitive, psychiatric and neuromedical
evaluation.
Results: A mixed model ANOVA revealed a significant within-subjects factor of encoding condition (i.e., didactic or self-generated PM
cue; [F(1,78)=8.82; p=0.004]), such that individuals were more likely
to remember to perform the PM task in the self-generated condition
(Hedge’s g=0.36). There were no significant HIV or interaction effects
(ps>0.10). A similar pattern was observed for the PM recognition (within-subjects factor: [F(1,78)=15.55; p<0.001; g=0.44]; all other factors
ps>0.10). Ongoing task performance was significantly quicker under
self-generated conditions (g=0.18; p=0.033). Within the HIV+ sample,
neurocognitively impaired adults demonstrated greater benefit from
self-generation than their cognitively normal counterparts (g=0.42).
These findings were not better explained by relevant demographic, disease, or psychiatric factors (ps>0.10).
Conclusions: The improved PM and reduced costs suggest that self-generation may be an effective means to improve PM in HIV infection by
enhancing encoding of the PM cue and thereby reducing the strategic
demands of the PM task. Future research should examine the applicability of this manipulation to other clinical populations with PM deficits
(e.g., TBI), as well as combine with interventions aimed at improving
other PM component processes (e.g., monitoring).

Impaired Cognitive Abilities in a Lifetime Obsessive-Compulsive
Disorder Sample.
Objective: To test for differences in prefrontal function between participants with a lifetime diagnosis of obsessive-compulsive disorder
(OCD) and healthy controls (HC). It was hypothesized that the OCD
group would show worse performance on neuropsychological tests, [the
Iowa Gambling Task (IGT), Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST), and
the Self-Ordered Pointing Task (SOPT)] indicating prefrontal cortex
deficits.
Participants and Methods: 46 subjects, 22 OCD (8 female, 14 male)
and 24 HC (13 female, 11 male), were enrolled. OCD age ranged
from 27 to 65 (M=44.32, SD=11.11) and HC from 18-64 (M=39.25,
SD=13.96). Years of education ranged from 11 to 18 (M=15.23,
SD=2.25) in OCD and 12-20 in HC (M=15.54, SD=2.40). Each subject

273
completed two computerized (IGT, WCST) and one paper (SOPT) task
for between-group comparison.
Results: OCD patients completed fewer categories on the WCST
(p=0.038) and nearly made more total errors (p=0.051) than HC.
OCD patients also had lower accuracy on the SOPT 12 stimuli subtest
(p=0.038) compared to HC.
Conclusions: The OCD group displayed executive function deficits
consistent with theories of dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and
ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC) dysfunction in OCD. Fewer
categories completed by OCD patients on the WCST indicates ineffective
inhibitory processes. Patients were less likely to spontaneously generate
organizational strategies effectively due to their lessened performance
on the SOPT-12 in comparison to HC. While the data are limited by
the small sample size, decreased task performance in the OCD group on
the WCST and SOPT, but not the IGT, may be attributed to the more
recently incorporated DLPFC and VLPFC into anatomical models of
OCD.

capacity and social skills performance in a sample of individuals with
severe mental illness (SMI).
Participants and Methods: Unemployed outpatients with SMI (schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, or major depression; n=153) were administered NP (expanded MATRICS Consensus Cognitive Battery), functional
capacity (UCSD Performance-Based Skills Assessment; UPSA), and social skills (Social Skills Performance Assessment; SSPA) assessments at
the beginning of a supported employment study.
Results: Bivariate correlations between NP tests and UPSA and SSPA
total scores showed that most NP tests were significantly associated with
each performance-based measure. Multiple regressions were conducted
entering NP tests that were significant at the bivariate level as predictors of UPSA and SSPA performance. Only premorbid IQ emerged as a
significant predictor of UPSA performance, in a model that explained
34% of the variance. Letter fluency and sustained attention (Continuous
Performance Test-Identical Pairs) were significant predictors of SSPA
performance, in a model explaining 23% of the variance. In models
accounting for diagnosis (psychosis or mood disorder), only diagnosis predicted UPSA performance, in a model explaining 45% of the
variance; letter fluency and sustained attention remained significant
predictors of SSPA performance.
Conclusions: Functional capacity, as measured by the UPSA, is positively associated with NP functioning, but may be strongly determined
by diagnosis, with mood disorder participants outperforming those with
psychosis. Social skill performance, as measured by the SSPA, appears
to be positively associated with verbal fluency and sustained attention
regardless of diagnosis. Improving verbal fluency and sustained attention may improve social skill performance in people with SMI.

Psychiatric Symptom Severity on Work Outcomes in Severe
Mental Illness.
Objective: Neuropsychological (NP) abilities are highly linked to employment patterns across neuropsychiatric disorders. We aimed to determine the strongest NP predictors of work outcomes in a supported

274
employment program to help individuals with severe mental illness
(SMI) re-enter the workforce.
Participants and Methods: Unemployed outpatients with SMI (schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, or major depression; n=136) were administered NP (expanded MATRICS Consensus Cognitive Battery), psychiatric symptom severity, and functional capacity assessments at the
beginning of a two-year supported employment study. Work outcomes
at two years included competitive job attainment (Yes/No) and weeks
worked.
Results: About half the participants obtained competitive work during
the study. Job attainment was modestly associated with better global
NP functioning, working memory, processing speed, and prospective
memory performance (rs=.22-.24, ps<.01), and the same variables
(except working memory) predicted weeks worked. Diagnosis (mood
vs. psychotic disorder), positive and negative symptom severity, and
functional and social skill performance were also associated with work
outcomes. Multiple regression analyses examining modifiable predictors
of work outcomes showed that in the context of multiple predictors, only
negative symptom severity predicted job attainment, and only positive
and negative symptom severity predicted job tenure. Worse symptoms
were associated with worse work outcomes.
Conclusions: NP functioning at baseline was modestly associated with
work outcomes at two years in this sample of outpatients with SMI
participating in supported employment. Participants with mood disorders were more likely to obtain work and worked more weeks than did
those with psychotic disorders; in a multivariate context, only positive
and negative symptom severity was associated with work outcomes.
Reducing psychiatric symptom severity may improve work outcomes
in people with SMI, particularly for people with psychosis.

Y. SHTEYNBERG & R. KOTOV. Verbal Learning and Memory
Impairments Among World Trade Center Responders: Differential
Correlates Among PTSD Sub-dimensions.
Objective: PTSD is associated with verbal memory impairment
(Johnsen & Asbjørnsen, 2008), but it remains unclear which dimensions of the syndrome (i.e., intrusiveness, avoidance, numbing, and/
or hyperarousal) are most responsible for effects, and whether they
remain important after controlling for depression. It has been suggested
that memory impairments may result from excessive internal arousal
(i.e., hyperarousal) interfering with initial acquisition and encoding
processes, rather than recall failure (Sandi & Pinelo-Nava, 2007), but
little research has examined this possibility (Diener, Flor, & Wessa,
2010). Moreover, few studies have considered whether verbal learning
and memory impairments occur among disaster responders. The present
work tested for the unique associations between PTSD dimensions and
verbal memory impairment in a sample of first responders to the 9/11
attacks on the World Trade Center (WTC).
Participants and Methods: Seventy-five first responders to the World
Trade Center (WTC) disaster were assessed in 2015 with the California
Verbal Learning Test-II (CVLT-II) as well as the PTSD Checklist for
DSM-IV (PCL), but modified to ask about symptoms specific to the
9/11 attacks.
Results: Total PTSD symptoms, as well as all three of four PTSD dimensions, were significantly associated with impaired learning (PCL
total r = .32; avoidance r = .24; numbing r = .30; hyperarousal r = .39,
p’s < .05) in 9/11 responders. However, after controlling for depression,
only hyperarousal remained a significant predictor of impaired learning
(semipartial r = .24, p < .05).
Conclusions: More than 13 years after the attacks on the WTC, PTSD
symptoms specific to the events of 9/11 among rescue and recovery
responders were significantly associated with impaired learning on
the CVLT-II. Even after controlling for effects from depression, hyperarousal symptoms in particular remained uniquely associated with

study highlighting neurocognitive and psychiatric changes.
Objective: To assess longitudinal changes in neurocognition, psychiatric
status, and quality of life (QOL) after DBS; to examine the viability of
DBS as a treatment option for severe OCD
Participants and Methods: AH was a 45-year-old Caucasian female at
the time of the DBS intervention. Prior to the procedure, she underwent
extensive neuropsychological assessment to establish baseline status, as
well as neuroimaging and psychiatric consultation. Following the DBS,
she underwent follow-up neuropsychological assessment, at 35 months
and 51 months subsequently.
Results: Postoperative neuropsychological results evidenced significant
improvements in the cognitive domains of processing speed, attention,
and executive functioning, as well as memory. AH provided qualitative
feedback to her treating psychiatrist which also consistently reflected a
reduction in her OCD symptoms and consequently, improved quality
of life (QOL).
Conclusions: As the longest-studied patient in currently published literature, AH and her ongoing progress are compelling. As an emerging
experimental therapy, DBS for OCD has generated promising outcomes
but still requires extensive evaluation in order to validate the safety and
reliability of the procedure.

L.S. CZEPIELEWSKI, J. BUCKER & C.S. GAMA. Cognitive
Performances and Neuroanatomical Volumes at Early and Late
Stages of Bipolar Disorder.
Objective: Bipolar disorder (BD) is a psychiatric disease known to present cognitive deficits, although literature is not consistent with which
domains or levels of dysfunction may be associated with it. It is controversial whether this may increase or not with illness progression.
Clinical staging model of BD differentiates early and milder clinical
phenomena from those that accompany illness chronicity. Neuroprogression is the pathological reorganization of the central nervous system along the course of severe mental disorders. Our goal was to test
this model, comparing cognitive performances and total cortex, frontal
cortex and hippocampus volumes of early and late stages of BD with
healthy controls (HC).
Participants and Methods: 37 euthymic BD and 53 HC matched for
age and years of education, divided in early and late stage groups according to ISBD proposed model, underwent psychiatry and neuropsychological assessment. Diagnostic or absence of it was confirmed with
SCID, and euthymia with YMRS and HAMD ≤ 7. T1-weighted MRIs
were acquired with Philips Achieva 1.5 Tesla scanner and volumetric
segmentations performed with Freesurfer image analysis suite v.5.1.0.
Intracranial volume was regressed out from total cortex, frontal cortex
and hippocampus volumes. Variables were analyzed using independent
samples t-tests or mann-whitney test, and relationship between them
was obtained by Spearman rank coefficient test.
Results: Both early and late stage BD performed worse on episodic memory and attention compared to their HCs (p<.05). However, early stage
BD had similar total cortex, frontal cortex and hippocampus volumes
than HC (p>.38). Late stage BD had smaller volumes than HC (p<.05).
Cognitive performance was correlated with total cortex and frontal cortex volumes in BD (p<.001,r=.61), but not in HC (p>.16,r<.24).

Conclusions: Cognitive impairments may appear early in the course
of BD, although its impact on brain might occur later. Therefore, it
highlights the importance of early interventions to prevent illness
progression.

M.K. DAHLGREN, K.A. SAGAR, M.T. RACINE, M.W. DREMAN &
S.A. GRUBER. Inhibitory Task Performance Is Not Worsened by
Comorbid Marijuana Use in Patients with Bipolar Disorder.
Objective: Bipolar Disorder (BPD) is a common, debilitating mood
disorder. Previous research has demonstrated cognitive impairment in
BPD including problems with concentration, attention, and executive
function. Comorbid substance use, particularly marijuana (MJ), is common in BPD, underscoring the importance of assessing the potential
additive effect of MJ use in these patients and determining if MJ use
results in additional cognitive impairment. Thus far, investigations have
reported inconsistent findings, and the specific impact of comorbid MJ
use in BPD remains unclear.
Participants and Methods: Twelve individuals with BPD who use MJ
(MJBP), 17 individuals with BPD who do not use MJ (BPD), and 21
healthy controls (HC) completed the Multi-Source Interference Task
(MSIT), a measure of cognitive interference and inhibitory processing.
Univariate analyses of variance (1-tailed) assessed the individual impact
of BPD as well as the additive impact of MJ use in BPD.
Results: As a group, all BPD participants (BPD + MJBP) made more errors of commission across the task (F(1,47)=5.520, p=.012, η2=.105),
particularly during the interference condition (F(1,47)=4.975, p=.016,
η2=.096); this contributed to a trend for lower interference performance
accuracy (F(1,47)=2.241, p=.071, η2=.046) relative to HC participants.
The BPD group made more total commission errors (F(1,35)=3.336,
p=.038, η2=.087), with a trend for more commission errors during
the interference condition (F(1,35)=2.667, p=.055, η2=.071) relative
to the HC group. Interestingly, a comparison of the BPD and MJBP
groups indicated that they were not significantly different with regard
to MSIT performance.
Conclusions: These data suggest that BPD significantly impairs executive function and inhibitory control, regardless of MJ use status.
Further, the potential additive effect of having both BPD and MJ use
did not emerge, underscoring the need for additional research to identify
potential mediating factors, such as partial mood stabilization.

D.R. COMBS. Neuropsychological Correlates on Decisional
Capacity for Informed Consent among Depressed Inpatients.
Objective: Ability to consent to medical treatment or medical research
participation may be degraded by several neuropsychiatric and medical conditions. Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a neuropsychiatric
condition in which cognitive dysfunction occurs. Such impairment may
compromise ability to provide consent, but few studies have evaluated
this possibility. The current study examined medical decision-making
capability in a group of depressed inpatients and a healthy-comparison
group. This study also examined whether neuropsychological impairment predicts impaired decisional capacity and if an educational intervention enhances these abilities.
Participants and Methods: 20 depressed inpatients and 20
healthy-comparison participants were administered a neuropsychological battery and a measure of medical decision-making, the MacCAT-CR.
Results: A mixed factor ANOVA revealed that the inpatients exhibited diminished capacity involving understanding and appreciation

275
abilities. Choice expression and reasoning abilities were equivalent
between groups. Multiple regression revealed that neuropsychological
impairment was a salient predictor of understanding and reasoning
abilities, exceeding the impact of depressive severity. Mixed factor ANOVAs showed that the remediation intervention improved understanding
performance, but not appreciation and reasoning abilities.
Conclusions: Depressed inpatients are vulnerable to making incompetent decisions regarding medical research participation, and, by
extension, medical treatment options. Neuropsychological impairment
emerged as a salient predictor of diminished decision-making capacity.
Although remediation improved some aspects of poor decision-making,
other facets remained unchanged. These findings address important
clinical and ethical issues that should be taken into consideration when
working with this population group.

E. BERMAN & N. PLISKIN. Detecting PTSD in Individuals with
an Electrical Injury.
Objective: Detecting symptoms of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder
(PTSD) is often an important part of a neuropsychological evaluation.
Individuals who have experienced an electrical injury (EI) often experience higher rates of PTSD than in the general population. The purpose
of this study was to examine the utility of the Trauma Symptom Inventory (TSI), the Impact of Events Scale (IES), and the PTSD-Checklist
Civilian Version (PCL-C) in detecting PTSD in individuals who have
experienced an EI.
Participants and Methods: Individuals with a diagnosis of PTSD were
compared against individuals without evidence of PTSD using logistic
regression analysis. There were 124 individuals in total out of whom 124
were administered the IES, 31 were administered the TSI, and 10 were
administered the PCL-C. Individuals were assigned a diagnosis of PTSD
based on a semi-structured interview by a board certified psychiatrist,
as part of a neuropsychological evaluation. There were no differences
between groups on age, education, gender, or handedness.
Results: The total score on the IES was significantly related to a diagnosis of PTSD. Only two of the five TSI subscales, Intrusive Experiences
(IE), and Defensive Avoidant (DA) were significantly correlated with
a diagnosis of PTSD. The PCL-C was not predictive of a diagnosis of
PTSD.
Conclusions: The detection of PTSD in individuals who have experienced an EI was detectable only by the IES and select subscales of the
TSI. Additional studies are needed to examine potential causes for these
differences and the sensitivity and specificity of each measure as well
as to examine the potentially unique profile of PTSD in EI patients.

M. FORTE, D.T. NEWELL & P.G. NESTOR. Attentional Control
Deficits in Schizophrenia.
Objective: We examined the role of attentional control, a key function
of working memory, in the neuropsychological disturbance of schizophrenia (SZ). Trails B of the Trail Making Test (TMT) and perseverative
errors of the Wisconsin Card Sorting (WCS) served as measures of
attentional control and the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Third Edition (WAIS-III) as an index of overall neuropsychological functioning.
Participants and Methods: WAIS-III, WCS, and TMT were available
for 85 medicated patients with schizophrenia (72 males, 13 females),
mean age of 41.81 (SD=9.4), mean equivalent chlorpromazine (CPZ)
equivalent daily dose of 436.10 mg (SD=369.56), and mean duration
of illness of 15.9 years (SD=10.33).
Results: Mean scores were Full-Scale IQ=90.27 (SD= 13.84), Trails
A= 49.11secs (SD= 19.77), Trails B=126.38 secs (SD= 67.55), WCS

276
perseverative errors = 25.89 (SD= 21.57), non-perseverative errors
=18.58 (SD= 11.33). As predicted, Trails B but not Trails A correlated
with WCS perseverative errors (r = .465, p < 0.001) but not with WCS
non-perseverative errors. Multiple regression indicated Trails B (F =
9.55, df = 1, 75, p = .003) and WCS perseverative errors (F = 7.23,
df= 1, 82, p = .009) each predicted IQ.
Conclusions: Intellectual abilities in SZ may be highly influenced by
executive attentional control functions related to response inhibition
and shifting mental sets.

J. FOX, S.V. ABRAM, E.C. ALDEN & M. SMITH. Default Mode
Functional Connectivity Predicts Working Memory in Low
Functioning Schizophrenia.
Objective: Working memory (WM) is theorized to recruit brain regions from the default mode network (DMN), which include the medial
prefrontal (mPFC) and dorsolateral prefrontal (dlPFC) cortices. We
evaluated whether DMN functional connectivity predicted WM in low
functioning schizophrenia (LF-SCZ), high functioning schizophrenia
(HF-SCZ), and healthy controls (CON).
Participants and Methods: LF-SCZ (n=13), HF-SCZ (n=15), and
CON (n=32) completed a 5-minute resting-state scan and WM tasks.
Resting data was processed using Independent Component Analysis.
Within-network connectivity metrics were computed for each subject.
We identified two anterior DMN networks (i.e. a dlPFC and mPFC metric). A WM domain score was computed for each subject. We used multivariable regression to predict WM performance. The model included
the dlPFC metric, the mPFC metric, and group status. We controlled for
parental socioeconomic status and movement. We determined the presence of any group X connectivity metric interactions. We followed-up
the interaction model with separate regression models for each group.
Results: We found a significant dlPFC X group interaction and a trending mPFC X group interaction when predicting WM (F10,45=3.86,
p<.001). Follow-up results indicated the dlPFC predicted WM among
LF-SCZ (p=.01) but not HF-SCZ (p=.58) or CON (p=.33). The mPFC
metric also predicted WM in LF-SCZ (p=.01) but not HF-SCZ (p=.50)
or CON (p=.96).
Conclusions: Our results suggest that DMN connectivity relates to WM
in with LF-SCZ but not HF-SCZ or CON. Prior research indicates that
DMN connectivity predicts WM in individuals with schizophrenia but
not controls. Our study suggests these associations may be most relevant
for LF-SCZ. Thus, increased within-network DMN connectivity may a
treatment target to improve WM abilities in LF-SCZ.

S.L. RAUCH & I.M. ROSSO. Reduced Rostral Anterior Cingulate
Volume is Associated with Greater Frequency of Negative
Automatic Thoughts in Adults with Major Depressive Disorder.
Objective: Chronic negative thinking is a core feature of major depressive disorder (MDD) and has been linked to deficits in the neural
circuitry underlying self-referential processing. Functional imaging
studies have shown that reduced rostral anterior cingulate (rACC) activity impedes the inhibition of negative information thereby perpetuating negative automatic thoughts (NATs) in MDD. The relationship
between NATs and rACC morphology, however, remains unclear. We
hypothesized a relationship between reduced rACC volume and greater
frequency of NATs, measured by the Automatic Thoughts Questionnaire
(ATQ), in adults with MDD.
Participants and Methods: Fifty-three participants with DSM-IV
MDD (20 male, 33 female) and 44 healthy controls (18 male, 24 female)
were interviewed using a clinician-administered SCID and the Hamilton

Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD), and completed the ATQ. Participants underwent MRI scanning at 3T, and rACC volumes corrected for
intracranial volume were determined using Freesurfer software. Multivariate analyses were performed to relate age, gender, and ATQ scores
to left and right rACC volumes separately for each group.
Results: Adults with MDD had more frequent NATs than healthy subjects (t(57.11)=-14.29, p<.001). rACC volumes did not differ between
groups. After controlling for age, gender, and HRSD scores in the MDD
group, higher ATQ scores were associated with decreased rACC volume (F(2,47)=3.71, p=0.03); this effect was significant for the right
(F(1,48)=6.36; p=0.02) but not the left rACC. ATQ scores were not
significantly associated with rACC volume in healthy controls.
Conclusions: In the MDD group, the frequency of NATs was higher
in individuals with reduced right rACC volume. Our findings provide
morphometric evidence that the right rACC, a region implicated in the
stimulus encoding of self-referent information, may play a central role
in facilitating negative self-referential processing and related cognitive
biases in the maintenance of depression.

S. GAT-LAZER, R. GEVA, E. GUR & D. STEIN. Harm Avoidance
and Reward Dependence in Patients with Eating Disorders.
Objective: Personality dimensions have crucial impact on eating disorders (ED). Our objective was to evaluate harm avoidance (HA) and
reward dependence (RD), which was further divided into sensitivity to
reward (SR) vs. sensitivity to punishment (SP) in patients with binge
purge type eating disorders (B/P EDs).
Participants and Methods: Participants were assessed upon admission to specialized ED departments (T1) and at discharge (T2). 50
B/P EDs patients and 34 demographically matched healthy controls
were recruited; 34 participants from each group participated in the
T2 assessment. ED and comorbidities evaluations included body mass
index (BMI), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and State Trait Anxiety
Inventory (STAI). Personality assessment was performed by the Tridimensional Personality Questionnaire (TPQ), sensitivity to reward and
punishment questionnaire (SPSRQ) and gambling task (GT).
Results: Patients with B/P EDs had lower BMI and elevated depression and anxiety on admission compared to controls (all p<0.001). No
between-group differences were found at discharge. B/P EDs patients
were characterized with lower TPQ-HA (p<0.05) and higher TPQ-RD
(p<0.01) on both T1 and T2. Specifically, B/P EDs patients showed
lower SPSRQ-SP and SPSRQ-SP (p<0.001 and p<0.05, respectively).
Positive correlation wawe found between HA and SP and negative between RD and SP (both p<0.001). Non-advantageous cards selection
on the GT decreased on recurrent exposure among controls (p<0.1),
but not in B/P EDs patients.
Conclusions: The low TPQ-HA of patients with B/P EDs has been
found in the present study to be associated with reduced SPSRQ-SP
rather than with increased SPSRQ-SR. These unique traits, along with
continuous disadvantageous cards selection in the GT, remain stable
the stabilization of disordered eating at T2, reflecting the persistent
pathologic decision making and performances of patients with B/P EDs.

impulsive tendencies. The current study examined a comprehensive
profile of neurocognitive processes (i.e., impulsivity, self-control, attentional blink, executive functioning, memory span, cognitive interference,
and inhibition) to determine the correlates of internet addiction in 54
undergraduate students.
Participants and Methods: Neurocognitive processes were measured
using the Barratt Impulsivity Scale, Tangney Self-Control Scale, Williams Inhibition Test, Berg’s Card Sorting Test, Attentional Blink Test,
Stop-it, and Corsi’s Block Test, whereas internet addiction was assessed
using the Internet Addiction Test.
Results: A series of Pearson’s product-moment correlations revealed
significant associations between number of times subjects correctly identified both letters during the attentional blink task (r= -0.24, p=0.038,
R-squared= 0.058) and the mean of stop-signal delay recorded during
the stop-signal inhibition task (r= -0.28, p=0.019, R-squared= 0.078)
with internet addiction. None of the other correlations between impulsiveness, self-control, executive functioning, memory span, and cognitive interference with internet addiction were statistically significant.
Conclusions: Preliminary findings from the present study could potentially expand our understanding of the links between impairments in
attentional processes and lack of inhibition with problematic internet
use in university students.

Neurocognitive Impairment in Depression is an Independent
Symptom Dimension.
Objective: Neuropsychological studies of major depression find deficits
in cognition but fail to detect a consistent association between depression
severity and neurocognitive dysfunction. In part, this is attributable
to the multifactorial nature of depression rating scales that combine
symptoms into heterogeneous aggregate scores. Using factor analysis,
we have found symptom clusters that more closely align with underlying
neurobiology. Our objective was to determine if neurocognitive dysfunction is more strongly associated with these symptom dimensions than
global depression scores.
Participants and Methods: Medication-free patients with current
major depressive disorder (MDD) (n=198) were compared to healthy
volunteers (n=107) on a battery of neuropsychological tests (reaction
time, attention, psychomotor speed, memory, working memory, abstraction, language fluency and impulse control). Depression severity was
assessed via the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale and Beck Depression
Inventory, decomposed into factors previously found to be differentially
associated with cerebral glucose metabolism (Milak et al., 2006, 2010),
suicidal ideation (Keilp et al., 2013) and suicidal behavior (Grunebaum
et al., 2006). Correlations were computed between test scores and symptom severity scores in the patient sample.
Results: MDD patients exhibited mild neurocognitive deficits in multiple areas of functioning relative to non-patients. None of these measures,
however, correlated at a level greater than .20 (p<.01) with total or
factor scores from depression rating scales.
Conclusions: MDD patients’ neurocognitive deficits were only weakly
associated with depressive symptom dimensions. Neurocognitive impairment is a core feature of depression, but distinct from mood and vegetative symptoms. Neurocognitive dysfunction represents an independent
component of illness reflecting related but distinct pathophysiological
processes that require additional evaluation using objective measures,
and may require separate pharmacological intervention.

K. RYAN. Baseline Intellectual Ability is Protective Against Decline
in Neuropsychological Functioning: Support for a Cognitive
Reserve Process.
Objective: This study measured change in neuropsychological functioning over 5 years among individuals with Bipolar Illness (BP) and Healthy
Controls (HC), as well as the influence of Cognitive Reserve (CR). CR
has only recently been applied to psychiatric disorders, and CR factors
may be protective against cognitive decline. We hypothesized that no
substantial differences would exist between the BP and HC groups in
terms of cognitive change over time and that CR factors would influence
the rate of cognitive decline.
Participants and Methods: Participants included 160 individuals diagnosed with BP and 76 HCs recruited as part of a longitudinal study
of BP. Participants underwent a neuropsychological evaluation at the
time of their enrollment and again 5 years later. Differences between
baseline scores and year 5 scores were calculated to determine an index
of overall change. Follow up analyses were completed to determine the
impact of CR factors on change over time.
Results: Results of ANOVA revealed no differences in change scores
between the BP and HC groups, with the exception of a visual memory
score, which revealed an improved performance for BP, but not HC
(p=.003). ”Decliners” were identified as individuals with change scores
at least 1 standard deviation below the HC mean - 83% of the decliners
were from the BP group. Among the BP “decliners,” lower baseline intellectual ability was associated with greater likelihood of decline over 5
years (p=.028; Decliners IQ M=108, Non-decliners IQ M=113). Decline
was not associated with age, education, psychotic symptoms, rapid cycling symptoms, age of onset, or suicidal ideation.
Conclusions: The BP group did not demonstrate accelerated cognitive
decline over 5 years compared to the HC group and our results do support the theory of CR in BP. Although the trajectory of cognitive change
over time is similar between BP and HC, lower baseline intellectual
ability may be a risk factor for increased cognitive decline over time.

L.B. KEATS & D. SITZER. The Relevance of Online and Offline
Theory of Mind (ToM) Processes in Predicting Social Skill Capacity
among Inpatients with Schizophrenia-Spectrum Disorders.
Objective: Individuals with schizophrenia show significant limitations
in social functioning. Theory of Mind (ToM), defined as the ability to
attribute mental states to oneself and others, has strong associations
with one’s ability to function optimally in his or her social environment.
In real-time social interaction, it has been suggested that the ability to
quickly and automatically attribute mental states (i.e., online ToM) may
be more important than the ability to consciously reason about mental
state information “offline” (i.e., explicit ToM). The current study aimed
to examine the relationship between online and offline ToM processes
and social capacity. Online ToM was hypothesized to have a stronger
association with social capacity than offline ToM.
Participants and Methods: Thirty-eight inpatients diagnosed with
schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder were recruited. Online and
explicit ToM were assessed by the Frith-Happé Animations and by false
belief stories, respectively. Social capacity was measured by performance
on the Social Skills Performance Assessment (SSPA). A correlational
design was employed to assess the strength of relationships between
predictor (ToM) and criterion (social capacity) variables.
Results: There was a strong positive relationship between both online (r
= .58, p < .01) and offline ToM (r = .53, p < .01) and the SSPA. ToM
processes accounted for 41% of the variance in social skill capacity.
Online ToM uniquely accounted for 23% of the variance and offline
ToM uniquely accounted for 16% of the variance in social capacity.
Conclusions: These results suggest both online and offline ToM processes have relevance in predicting inpatient’s social aptitude. The

278
ability to quickly and automatically attribute mental states has significance in that remediation may also generalize to offline processes.
Future studies may assess the efficacy of targeted remediation of ToM
processes on social capacity.

B. KOO, L. ZAJAC & R. KILLIANY. Functional coherence along
the hippocampal longitudinal axis fingerprints episodic memory
problems in Schizophrenics.
Objective: In this study, we assessed functional activation and coherence pattern along the hippocampal long axis to understand whether
memory deficits in schizophrenic subjects relies on either discrete functionality or regional integrity among different hippocampal subregions.
Participants and Methods: Ten patients with schizophrenia and 11
healthy subjects took part in the study. Subjects performed a face-name
pair memory task during fMRI. Four hippocampal sub-regions (ROIs)
were automatically labeled bilaterally to assess functional coherence
(asymmetry index) of the hippocampal long axis in the encoding and
recall conditions separately. Whole brain activation pattern was also
assessed to provide large-scale information about episodic memory.
Results: Schizophrenics showed lowered activation and opposite coherence patterns compared to controls in and between ROI 1 (most
anterior) and 3 (intermediate). In whole brain analysis, schizophrenics
also showed hypo-activation in lingual gyrus, right BA44/45 and left
para-cingulate region while highly overlapped pattern were confirmed
in fusiform, BA44/45, superior parietal regions. In recall, schizophrenics
revealed slightly lowered activation in bilateral ROI3 and enhanced activation in ROI1. Whole brain activation revealed considerable overlap
between schizophrenics and controls.
Conclusions: Compared to the large scale activation assessments,
synchronization between hippocampal subregions as well as regional
switching on their functionality in different functional tasks provide
more clear explanation on the difference between groups. Addition to the
recent findings on the gradient pattern of the long axis in terms of gene
expression and extrinsic connectivity, pinpointing the key sub-regional
foci and their functional and anatomical relationships may provide a key
to understand and develop better treatments on the disease.

R. JUELICH & D. ONGUR. Cognitive Variability in Psychosis:
Cluster Solution Replication and Association with Resting State
Networks.
Objective: Substantial cognitive variability exists across the psychoses, and a clear profile of cognitive strengths and weaknesses has not
emerged. Cluster analysis permits data-driven grouping of individuals,
in contrast to use of predetermined grouping criteria. Cognitive clusters
may reveal stronger associations with biological variables; however,
clusters solutions are dependent upon the measures used to generate
them. We aimed to: a) replicate a cross-diagnostic cluster analysis using a different cognitive battery in a separate sample and b) examine
associations between clusters and resting state networks using fMRI.
Participants and Methods: Participants with psychosis (n=105) and
healthy controls (n=24) were assessed using the MATRICS Battery,
clinical measures, and fMRI resting state connectivity (RSFC) analysis.
MATRICS data were analyzed using a K-means cluster approach and
canonical discriminant function analysis. RSFC data were acquired using fMRI. Clusters were compared on diagnosis and measures of clinical
symptoms, community functioning, and network connectivity.
Results: A four-cluster solution provided adequate fit, and – similar to
our previous report – yielded a ‘neuropsychologically normal’ cluster,

a globally and significantly impaired cluster, and two clusters of mixed
cognitive profiles. Clusters differed on several clinical variables; diagnoses were distributed amongst all clusters, although not evenly. Clusters
differed on RSFC measures.
Conclusions: This replication in an independent sample using a different but related cognitive battery suggests that these clusters identify
meaningful groupings and are not simply a function of the measures
used to derive them. Clusters were associated with RSFC in networks
associated with relevant cognitive processes. Identification of groups of
patients who share similar neurocognitive profiles may help pinpoint
relevant clinical and neural abnormalities underlying these traits.

A. MAKSIMOVSKIY, A. RIECKMANN, C.B. FORTIER,
R. MCGLINCHEY, D.H. SALAT, W.P. MILBERG & M. OSCARBERMAN. Synergistic Impact of Drinking and Smoking on White
Matter Integrity and Cognitive Function in Young Veterans.
Objective: Pathological alcohol consumption has been linked to cerebral
and cognitive deficits. Changes in white matter integrity (WMI; Fortier,
2014) and reaction-time variability (RTV; Jacobson, 1994) are amongst
the commonly reported findings. Nicotine exposure has been shown to
affect similar domains (Pritchard, 1992; Gons, 2011). Since drinking
and smoking are highly comorbid (Kalman, 2005), particularly within
the U.S. Veteran population (Gierisch, 2012), we sought to examine
the effects of cigarette smoking and alcohol consumption on WMI and
cognitive function. We hypothesized that comorbid drinking and smoking would have a larger effect on RTV and anterior WMI than alcohol
consumption alone.
Participants and Methods: The participants were 208 U.S. Veterans
(56 smokers [SM] mean age 29.55) and 152 non-smokers [NS] mean
age 32.35) from the longitudinal TRACTS study. We examined measures of lifetime alcohol consumption (SM: mean 1803.48 oz; NS mean:
969.74 oz), diffusion tensor imaging, as well as a simple reaction time
task, in which participants were instructed to respond to a cue, allowing
us to measure their RTV.
Results: Multiple regression analysis demonstrated a significant interaction between lifetime drinking and smoking status on RTV, suggesting
that higher amounts of drinking were related to increasing RTV only
within SM (Estimate = 10.82, p < 0.05). WMI appeared to mediate this
relationship, since it decreased as a function of alcohol consumption (anterior corona radiata; Estimate = -6.49, p < 0.05) and also was related
to increased RTV (Estimate = -168.39, p < 0.05). A formal mediation
model confirmed a small but significant effect of WMI on drinking and
RTV within SM only (p < 0.05).
Conclusions: Alcohol consumption and smoking synergistically impacted WMI and cognition in a different way than drinking alone.
These results warrant further investigation into the nuanced impact of
comorbid substance abuse on brain structure and neuropsychological
functions.

The Role of Metabolic Abnormalities in the Generalized
Neurocognitive Deficit in Schizophrenia.
Objective: Individuals with schizophrenia have been found to display
neurocognitive deficits of a similar magnitude across a wide range of
cognitive domains. These deficits typically fall around one standard
deviation below the mean for healthy controls, with no clear pattern of
cognitive deficits characterizing the majority of individuals with schizophrenia. Such findings have led some to suggest that schizophrenia is
characterized by a “generalized” neurocognitive deficit, where a common underlying etiology impacts all cognitive domains. Central nervous

Forty Fourth Annual INS Meeting Abstracts
system accounts of the generalized deficit have been proposed; however,
there may also be more diffuse “general systems” abnormalities that
affect brain function, such as metabolic dysfunction.
Participants and Methods: Participants included 30 patients with
schizophrenia (n=21) or schizoaffective disorder (n=9) and 33 demographically matched healthy controls. Participants completed various
metabolic measurements, including fasting blood glucose, pulse pressure, and abdominal obesity. Neuropsychological measures included a
measure of premorbid intellectual functioning and the MATRICS Consensus Cognitive Battery.
Results: Results indicated that higher pulse pressure predicted the
generalized neurocognitive deficit in schizophrenia, but not healthy
controls; however, blood glucose and abdominal obesity did not predict cognitive performance in either group. Further, pulse pressure was
negatively correlated with several individual cognitive domains in patients, including attention/vigilance, verbal and visual learning, and an
index of global cognition.
Conclusions: These findings provide support for the role of metabolic
abnormalities in the generalized neurocognitive deficit in schizophrenia,
and suggest that treatment of hypertension may be a novel target for
remediating cognitive deficits in this population.

A. MARCHEWKA, A. WICHNIAK & E. LOJEK. Memory of basic
emotions in schizophrenia.
Objective: Recent research has shown that patients with schizophrenia display atypical patterns of performance with reduced top-down
control of learning processes and lack of emotion-driven effects while
performing directed forgetting task. However, little is known about the
impact of specific emotions on learning in schizophrenia. The aim of this
study was to analyze the effects of basic emotion on directed forgetting
in schizophrenia.
Participants and Methods: Fourteen patients (12 male; age: 31+/- 8
years old) diagnosed with schizophrenia according to ICD-10 criteria completed a directed forgetting procedure during which they were
asked to either remember or forget visual affective stimuli selected from
Nencki Affective Picture System and International Affective Picture
System databases. Two hundreed forty pictures with content which had
been classified as neutral or eliciting one of the negative basic emotions
(sadness, fear, disgust) were presented during the encoding phase of
the study. After short (10 minutes) delay participants were asked to
recognize the previously presented stimuli among 480 (240 old and
240 matched new stimuli).
Results: The main effect of instruction ( F(1,13) = 7,4; p< 0,05) with
higher recognition rate for the to-be-remembered (56%) than to-be-forgotten (52%) stimuli was observed. The effects of the picture content (
F(3, 11) = 12,4; p<0,001) were also observed - each of the basic emotions was recognized more accurately than neutral stimuli. Additionally,
more disgust-eliciting stimuli (62%) were recognized than sadness-eliciting stimuli (52%). No two-way interactions were observed.
Conclusions: We observed that emotional learning may be modulated by emotion type in schizophrenia. Results of this study are in
line with previous reports showing enhanced encoding for disgust related stimuli in healthy participants. Thus, effects of basic emotions on
emotion-cognition interaction in schizophrenia should be examined in
further studies.

E.A. OLSON, R. FUKUNAGA, C.A. WEBB, I.M. ROSSO,
W.D. KILLGORE & S.L. RAUCH. Delay Discounting and
Anhedonia are Independently Associated with Suicidal Ideation
in Depression.
Objective: Identifying factors related to suicidal ideation (SI) in major
depressive disorder (MDD) is a critical need. Recently, alterations in

279
reward-processing systems have been identified as a possible risk factor. Delay discounting (DD) combines aspects of reward valuation with
future-oriented thinking. DD rates are elevated in SI, consistent with
preferential valuation of immediate rather than long-term consequences.
However, the extent to which elevation of DD rates in SI might be attributable to reduced reward sensitivity (anhedonia) versus other processes
involved in DD has not been explored. We examined anhedonia, DD, and
demographic variables to identify independent predictors of SI in MDD.
Participants and Methods: 31 MDD participants and 25 healthy
controls (HC) age 18-45 were included in the analysis and completed
a computerized DD task along with measures of anhedonia (SHAPS)
and distress (K10). Current SI was coded as present (n = 13) or absent
(n = 18) based on responses to items on the SCID, PHQ-9, and MASQ.
Probit regression was used to classify SI group based on demographic
factors (age, sex), psychological factors (anhedonia, distress), and DD.
Results: As expected, MDD participants had greater distress and anhedonia. Compared to the HC group, the MDD group also showed elevated
rates of DD, t(54) = -2.236, p = 0.029. Within the MDD group, the
omnibus test of the probit regression was significant, Chi-Square (5) =
19.093, p = 0.002. Increased anhedonia (Wald Chi-Square (1) = 4.037,
p = 0.045) and elevated DD rates (Wald Chi-Square (1) = 4.228, p =
0.040) were both associated with SI.
Conclusions: DD and anhedonia are independently associated with SI
in adults with MDD, after controlling for age, sex, and distress. These
results suggest that decreased reward valuation does not completely
account for the relationship between DD and SI; this may be related
instead to other cognitive processes involved in DD such as impulsivity
and/or time perception.

& K. KEE. Neurocognitive Correlates of Schizotypal Personality
Traits in University Students.
Objective: Schizotypal Personality Disorder (SPD) is considered to be
an attenuated form of schizophrenia. Studies have demonstrated that
SPD is characterized by impairments in neurocognitive processes, social
interaction, and behavioral flexibility/imagination. However, the relationships between these impairments and SPD in non-clinical samples
remain unclear. The current ongoing study examined a comprehensive
profile of neurocognitive processes (i.e., attentional blink, impulsivity,
self-control, inhibition, emotional memory, and emotional creativity)
to determine the correlates of schizotypal personality traits in 51 university students.
Participants and Methods: Participants’ schizotypal personality traits
were assessed using the Schizotypal Personality Questionnaire (SPQ-B).
Neurocognitive processes were measured using the Attentional Blink
Test, Barratt Impulsivity Scale, Tangney Self-Control Scale, Stop-It
Inhibition Test, Immediate Serial Recall Task for emotional memory,
and Emotional Creativity Inventory.
Results: A series of Pearson’s product-moment correlations revealed
multiple significant associations between schizotypal tendencies
with the neurocognitive functions of motor impulsivity (r= 0.29, p=
0.019, R-squared= 0.085), attentional impulsivity (r= 0.27, p= 0.029,
R-squared= 0.071), non-planning impulsivity (r= 0.24, p= 0.049,
R-squared= 0.055), self-control (r= 0.54, p= 0.0001, R-squared=
0.288), and the novelty component of emotional creativity (r= 0.25,
p= 0.04, R-squared= 0.062). Specifically, higher scores on the SPQ-B
were linked to more quick shifts in participants’ attention and a greater
tendency to act in an instantaneous and unplanned way. Also, higher
SPQ-B scores were related to more self-control and willingness to explore
novel emotions.
Conclusions: These preliminary findings could provide new insights
of the potential roles of specific aspects of neurocognitive processes in
predicting schizophrenia risk factors in healthy individuals.

S.A. PARIKH, J. WILSON, L.M. SILVA, J. DIGANGI, M. FEIGON,
E. BERMAN & N. PLISKIN. ROC Analysis of the Trauma Symptom
Inventory in Assessing PTSD in Patients with Electrical Injury.
Objective: Electrical injuries (EI) are associated with a variety of longterm psychological sequelae such as anxiety, depression, and PTSD
(Chaudasama et al., 2010; Piotrowski et al., 2013; & Singerman, Gomez, and Fish, 2008). It is important for health practitioners to distinguish PTSD from other sequelae in order to deliver appropriate patient
centered care. This study evaluated whether the Trauma Symptom
Inventory (TSI; Briere, 1995) had adequate classification accuracy for
a diagnosis of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) in a sample of
EI patients. Previous research found that both the Anxious Avoidance
(AA) and Defensive Avoidance (DA) scales had the largest effect sizes
in identifying PTSD in trauma exposed community residents (McDevitt-Murphy et al, 2005). The hypothesis was that select scales on the
TSI would accurately predict a diagnosis of PTSD.
Participants and Methods: A diagnosis of PTSD was assigned based
on DSM-IV criteria, diagnostic interview and assessment conducted by
a board certified psychiatrist. Based on this criteria, participants were
placed into a PTSD (n = 19) or non-PTSD group (n = 12) and were
administered the TSI along with additional tests of neuropsychological
functioning. There were no differences between groups on years of education or age. The average age and education of participants was 40 and
12.6 years, respectively. 87% of participants were Caucasian while 6.5%
were Hispanic. 12.94% of the sample was female and 87% were male.
Results: A logistic regression analysis was used to calculate the combined variable consisting of two TSI scales (AA and DA). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis indicated that the TSI had good
classification accuracy, with Area Under the Curve (AUC) = .76. Using
an optimal cutoff score of .68, sensitivity was 57% when specificity
was set at 91%.
Conclusions: The results suggested that the combined TSI variable
might have some utility in aiding diagnostic procedures for patients
who have experienced EI.

& A. O’DONOVAN. Verbal Memory and Inflammation in Veterans
with PTSD, Past PTSD, and No PTSD.
Objective: Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) has been associated
with verbal memory impairments, but it is unclear if memory impairments persist once PTSD symptoms improve. We hypothesized that
veterans with current PTSD would show poorer verbal memory performance compared to veterans with past PTSD and controls, and that
veterans with past PTSD would perform similarly to controls. Further, we hypothesized that there would be differences in Interleukin-6
(IL-6) and soluble receptor II of Tumor Necrosis Factor (sTNF-RII)
between groups, and that inflammatory markers would be related to
PTSD severity.
Participants and Methods: In a sample of Gulf War veterans with current PTSD (n =45), past PTSD (n = 40), and controls with no history of
PTSD (n = 156), we evaluated immediate memory and delayed memory
using the California Verbal Learning Test (CVLT),Wechsler Memory
Scales II Logical memory subtest, IL-6 and sTNF-RII.
Results: There were no significant differences on verbal immediate
memory between groups on either the CVLT or Logical Memory. In
contrast, on measures of delayed memory, veterans with current PTSD
retained less information on both CVLT, F(2, 222) = 3.30, p = .039, and
Logical Memory, F(2, 230) = 3.63, p = .028, whereas veterans with past

PTSD performed similarly to controls. Participants with current PTSD
did not have higher IL-6 or sTNF-RII mean levels than participants
without PTSD or with past PTSD. However, there was a significant
negative relationship between PTSD severity and IL-6 (r = -.263; p =
.029). Further, higher sTNF-RII was related to poorer verbal learning on
the CVLT and immediate and delayed memory on the Logical Memory
subtest in participants with current PTSD only; IL-6 was not associated
with memory performance in any group.
Conclusions: Overall, these results suggest verbal memory deficits remit when PTSD symptoms remit, and that there is altered inflammatory
activity in participants with higher PTSD symptom severity.

J.R. PERAZA, J.R. SADEK, M.S. GOODKIND, D.T. CASTILLO &
K.Y. HAALAND. Does Neurocognitive Ability Predict Treatment
Success for PTSD?
Objective: It is well known that posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is
associated with neurocognitive weaknesses. Two types of psychotherapy
[cognitive processing therapy (CPT), prolonged exposure (PE)] have
been shown to improve PTSD symptoms, but it is not known if neurocognitive weaknesses influence outcome. Only one study examined this
issue finding that better pre-treatment verbal learning was associated
with greater improvement in PTSD symptoms after cognitive behavior
therapy. The purpose of the current study was to (1) replicate this
finding, (2) determine if other neurocognitive functions influenced therapeutic efficacy, and (3) determine if the relationship between pre-treatment neurocognitive functions and therapeutic efficacy were different
for CPT, PE, and skills training. We predicted executive functions,
which have been associated with maintenance of PTSD (e.g., difficulty
inhibiting maladaptive responses to trauma stimuli) and verbal learning
would be associated with treatment success for CPT and PE.
Participants and Methods: Fifty-one female veterans with PTSD
(31.4% white, 36.6 mean age) underwent neuropsychological assessment (attention, working memory, inhibition/switching, verbal learning) before group treatment for PTSD (PE, CPT, skills training). Symptoms of PTSD were assessed before and after each treatment modality
with the PTSD Symptom Checklist (PCL).
Results: Baseline neuropsychological test performance was not significantly correlated with PCL change for any treatment (e.g., inhibition/
switching with PE, r = .17, CPT, r = -.02; verbal learning with PE,
r = -.10, CPT, r = -.09) despite clinical improvement. It would take
sample sizes ranging from 444 to 32,482 to find significant effects for
these correlations.
Conclusions: There were no significant relationships between pre-treatment neurocognitive functions and symptom outcome. The null hypothesis that neurocognitive abilities are unrelated to treatment change was
accepted as power analyses indicated such small effect sizes.

J. PETERSEN & K. OSIPOWICZ. Diffuse Cortical Differences in
Schizophrenia: A Resting-State fMRI Study.
Objective: In this study we examined whole-brain functional connectivity in patients with schizophrenia compared to normal controls using
resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Studies
demonstrating dysfunctional integration of brain regions suggest schizophrenia might arise from abnormal or reduced connection between brain
regions. We hypothesized global functional disconnectivity with higher
degrees of disconnectivity in the mesial temporal lobe system, as the
hippocampus and surrounding structures have been implicated in the
neuropathology of schizophrenia.
Participants and Methods: Participants included 71 patients with previous diagnoses of schizophrenia (12 females; age range: 18-64, M=37,

Forty Fourth Annual INS Meeting Abstracts
SD=13) and 69 healthy controls (20 females; age range: 18-65, M=36,
SD=12). The two groups showed no statistically significant differences
on the basis of age, gender, or handedness.
Results: Our results provide evidence of global, reduced functional connectivity in schizophrenia. Diffuse cortical differences included marked
disconnectivity in the mesial temporal lobe system, particularly in the
left hippocampus and bilateral parahippocampus. Increased connectivity was shown in the cerebellum.
Conclusions: The understanding of functional connectivity abnormalities in schizophrenia, gleaned through neuroimaging techniques, will
aid in the identification of key brain regions that should be further
analyzed through neuropsychological assessment. Multidisciplinary
cooperation and research in the fields of neuroimaging and neuropsychology will provide insights into understanding and helping of patients
with schizophrenia.

M.J. HOPTMAN, C. POLLARI & F. GUNNING. Cortical Predictors
of Persistence of Apathy in Late-life Depression.
Objective: Apathy often co-occurs with depression in older adults, and
is associated with increased disability and persistence of depressive
symptoms. Furthermore, apathy is less responsive to SSRI treatment
than other symptoms of depression. Apathy can be defined as a “reduction of voluntary, goal-directed behavior”. Abnormalities within the
salience network (SN) result in a reduced ability to detect and respond
to relevant stimuli in a way that allows purposeful, goal-directed action. Abnormalities within the SN may contribute to apathy in older
depressed adults. In this study, we predicted that cortical abnormalities
within the SN would be associated with persistent apathy following SSRI
treatment in older adults. Specifically, we hypothesized that baseline
cortical thickness within the insula and dorsal anterior cingulate would
predict apathy severity following 12-weeks of escitalopram treatment.
Participants and Methods: Our sample consisted of 29 older adults
with a primary diagnosis of non-psychotic major depression. Participants were treated with 12 weeks of escitalopram at a target daily dose
of 20 mg. Apathy was quantified using the Apathy Evaluation Scale
(AES). Depression severity was assessed using the 24-item Hamilton
Depression Rating Scale (HDRS). Cortical thickness was obtained using
an automated MRI segmentation technique (FreeSurfer).
Results: Controlling for age and level of depression, right insular cortical thickness at baseline predicted total apathy scores in depressed older
adults following 12 weeks of treatment with escitalopram (r (25)=-.44,
p=.02).
Conclusions: Gray matter abnormalities within the SN are associated
with persistence of apathy following SSRI treatment. Interventions that
target salience processing may be useful to treat apathy in older depressed adults.

Relationships Between Vocabulary and Physical Aggression
during the Transition to Formal Schooling.
Objective: This study examines the transactional relations between vocabulary and externalizing behaviors (physical aggression, hyperactivity
and inattention) during the preschool to primary school transition (42,
60, 72 and 84 months).
Participants and Methods: The sample includes 572 children from
the Quebec Longitudinal Study of Child Development. Repetitive measures of vocabulary (Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test-Revised) and
externalizing behaviors (Social Behavior Questionnaire) were used in
the present study and analysed using cross-lagged panel model analyses.

281
Results: Two cross-lagged path coefficients emerged as significant for
physical aggression: lower vocabulary scores at 60 mo predicted higher
physical aggression scores at 72 mo (β= -.11, p<.05), and higher physical aggression scores at 72 mo predicted lower vocabulary scores at 84
mo (β= -.12, p<.01). For non-violent externalizing behavior, only one
cross-lagged path emerged as significant: lower vocabulary scores at
60 mo predicted higher hyperactivity (β= -.09, p<.05) and inattention
(β= -.20, p<.001).
Conclusions: Results suggest longitudinal associations during the transition to formal schooling, where poor verbal skills in preschool predict
physical aggression, hyperactivity and inattention assessed during kindergarten. The transition to school is a major developmental challenge
for children. Children who enter elementary school with poor verbal
skills can make these challenges more difficult. Results also suggest a
transactional association between cognition and behavior but only for
violent externalizing behavior, where vocabulary and physical aggression are sequentially and reciprocally related to each other: poor verbal
skills in preschool predict physical aggression in kindergarten, which in
turn predicts lower verbal skills in 1st grade. For children who exhibit
physical aggression, academic and social participation in the school
environment could be hindered in such a way that it limits opportunities
for learning new vocabulary.

C. SARAPAS, H. LIU, L.N. LIEBERMAN, E.S. STEVENS &
S. SHANKMAN. Relationships Between Attention and Anxiety in
Low- and High- Stress Contexts.
Objective: Neuropsychological studies have generally not found relationships between anxiety and attention. One hypothesis is that anxiety
interferes with attention only under stress, making the relationship difficult to capture in controlled laboratory or clinical settings. We therefore
examined whether anxiety was more strongly predictive of attention
deficits in threatening than safe contexts.
Participants and Methods: Participants were 38 individuals with current panic disorder and 37 healthy controls (70.7% female, mean age
= 28.4, SD = 9.2). Participants completed the Attention Network Test
(ANT), a computerized task assessing efficiency of attentional alerting, orienting, and executive control. To investigate whether attention
is differentially disrupted under stress among anxious individuals, we
administered the ANT under both Safe (no shock) and Threat (mild
electric shock to wrist at any time) conditions. Participants also completed self-report measures of broad anxiety (Beck Anxiety Inventory
[BAI]); panic-related symptoms (Inventory of Depression and Anxiety
Symptoms [IDAS] Panic Subscale); and anxiety sensitivity (Anxiety
Sensitivity Index – 3rd Edition [ASI-III]).
Results: Measures of anxiety and attention during Safe were not correlated. However, attentional alerting during Threat was correlated with
panic symptoms, r(72) = -.31, p < .01; broad anxiety, r(72) = -.23, p =
.05; and anxiety sensitivity, r(72) = -.30, p = .01. Moreover, individuals
with panic disorder trended towards poorer alerting than controls during
Threat, F(1, 72) = 3.13, p < .10, but not during Safe.
Conclusions: Results suggest that for anxious individuals, efficiency
of attentional alerting is disrupted in stressful contexts. This indicates
that (1) anxious individuals’ attention may be especially poor in settings
where it is most needed, and (2) this deficit may not be adequately
captured by traditional neuropsychological assessment in controlled
environments.

S.K. SULLIVAN, K.M. WHEARTY, L. MORRA, K.L. OSSENFORT,
K.H. FROST & G.P. STRAUSS. Impaired Effort-Cost Computation
in Schizophrenia is Associated with Avolition.
Objective: Motivational symptoms in schizophrenia (SZ) are associated
with a range of clinical outcomes and functional ability. Emerging evidence suggests that SZ are less willing to expend high effort for high
rewards, and that reduced willingness to expend effort for high rewards
is associated with severity of negative symptoms. The current study
examined whether effort-cost computation on a progressive ratio task
was associated with negative symptoms of SZ.
Participants and Methods: Participants included outpatients diagnosed with SZ (n = 27) and demographically matched healthy controls
(n = 32) who completed a progressive ratio task that required incrementally greater amounts of physical effort to obtain monetary reward.
Breakpoint, the point at which participants were no longer willing to
exert effort for a certain reward value, was examined as an index of
effort-cost computation.
Results: There were no group differences in breakpoint for low, medium, or high value rewards on the progressive ratio task. However,
lower breakpoint scores were associated with greater severity of avolition
and anhedonia symptoms in SZ patients.
Conclusions: Findings provide further evidence that impaired effort-cost computation is linked to motivational abnormalities in SZ.
Future research in this area may help to clarify the role that effort-cost
computation plays in the development and maintenance of motivational
symptoms in SZ.

O. PUIG-NAVARRO, K.R. THOMAS & E.W. TWAMLEY. Predictors
of Work Attainment After a Combined Treatment of Compensatory
Cognitive Training and Supported Employment in Severe Mental
Illness: Preliminary Results.
Objective: To study whether cognition and age group predicted work
outcome in the context of a supported employment intervention augmented with a 12-week Compensatory Cognitive Training (SE+CCT)
for participants with severe mental illness (SMI). CCT focused on addressing attention, learning, prospective memory, and executive functioning, which are related to work functioning.
Participants and Methods: Forty unemployed outpatients with SMI
(25 with severe mood disorders, 15 with schizophrenia-spectrum disorder) completed the SE+CCT intervention (mean age=47.2). Age groups
included 7 young (20-35), 15 medium-age (36-50) and 18 older patients (51-66). Cognitive functioning was measured at baseline and
after CCT. Work outcome was defined as obtaining a job during the 24
month study. Logistic regression analysis were conducted with work
outcome as the dependent variable and improvement in cognitive domains (post-pretreatment scores) and age group as potential predictors.
Baseline cognition, premorbid intelligence, diagnostic group, clinical
symptom severity, and years of education were controlled for as potential confounders.
Results: Almost half of the participants got a job (19, 47.5%) during
the study. Improvement in attention/vigilance (Continuous Performance
Test–Identical Pairs) emerged as a significant predictor of work attainment (B=2.35, SE=1.16, p=0.043). Age group was also a significant
predictor, with younger and older participants being more likely to obtain work compared with medium-aged participants (B=4.03, SE=1.43,
p=0.005; B=2.16, SE=0.93, p=0.021 respectively). The results were
maintained after controlling for potential confounders.
Conclusions: Improved attention and age group were associated with
better work outcome after a combined treatment of SE+CCT. Improving attention may be an important target for improving work outcome.
Younger and older participants seemed to benefit more from the combined treatment of SE+CCT in terms of work attainment.

M.R. TIMPANO SPORTIELLO, C. PARRINI, S. TOCCHINI &
D.M. CAMMISULI. Neurocognitive Profile of Patients with
Obsessive-compulsive Disorder: Role of Executive Dysfunction.
Objective: To clarify if the cognitive impairment of patients with Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) consists of a combined deficit of
memory, visuospatial abilities and executive functioning or if executive
dysfunction determines instrumental deficits.
Participants and Methods: 30 subjects with OCD (M:F=70:30%,
age 42±14, education 9±3 yrs) were assessed by the Maudsley Obsessive Compulsive Inventory (MOCQ/R), Wechsler Memory Scale-IV
(WMS-IV), Apraxia Constructive Test, Block Design, Tower of LondonDX (ToLDX), Brixton Test and Stroop Test. Friedman and Wilcoxon Tests (Bonferroni corrected) were used to compare performances
on neuropsychological tests. Pearson’s correlations were performed
between scores obtained by patients on neuropsychological tests and
MOCQ/R Total score.
Results: The OCD patients performed more poorly on visual than verbal
memory (p < .05) of WMS-IV. MOCQ/R scores positively correlated
with the following WMS-IV subtests: Logical Memory I (r= .72), II (r=
.58) and Recognition (r= .65); Pairs Associates Learning Immediate Recall (r= .82), Delayed Recall (r= .83) and Recognition (r= .73); Designs
I (r = .57), (p < .01). Within executive domain, mental flexibility was
more deteriorated than planning (p < .05), as showed by comparing
scores on Brixton Test and Total Move Score, Total Execution Time and
Total Violation Time. ToL Initiation Time negatively correlated with
the Doubting subscale of MOCQ/R (r= -.58, p < .05).
Conclusions: The OCD patients show difficulties in encoding and
strategical organization of non-verbal memory stimuli rather than in
storage. According to the revision of ToLDX, the cited subtests measure
planning efficiency and they support cognitive components of mental
flexibility. Moreover, OCD patients with high level of doubting do not
spend more time to initiate tasks but they impulsively act. The neuropsychological profile of OCD patients is suggestive of a predominant
executive dysfunction that affects instrumental abilities by depicting a
typical neurocognitive endophenotype.

I. TORRES, S. MACKALA, S.S. AHN, C. HIDIROGLU, G. ALAMIAN
& L. YATHAM. Metacognitive Monitoring in Bipolar Disorder.
Objective: Patients with bipolar disorder show poor concordance between subjective and objective cognitive functioning, suggesting impaired metacognition. However, this has primarily been studied when
patients make subjective ratings of their general cognitive functioning
in daily life. The extent to which patients show unawareness of cognitive functioning while engaging in specific cognitive tasks, however, is
poorly understood. The present study evaluated metacognitive monitoring accuracy on an item-to-item basis during performance of a specific
cognitive task.
Participants and Methods: Seventy-six clinically stable patients diagnosed with DSM-IV Bipolar Disorder and 40 demographically similar
healthy volunteers were administered a modified version of the 208 item
Halstead Category Test. On each trial, subjects were asked to rate their
level of confidence on a scale from 0 (just guessing) to 100 (completely
confident) that quantified the degree to which they believed that their
response was correct. Outcomes included 1) relative accuracy: the relationship between confidence ratings and performance across the task,
2) absolute accuracy: the degree of discrepancy between confidence

Forty Fourth Annual INS Meeting Abstracts
ratings and performance, and 3) bias: the degree of over- or underconfidence in ratings.
Results: Patients showed poorer overall Category Test performance,
t(114)=2.3, p<.05, as well as lower mean confidence ratings t(114)=2.3,
p<.05 than controls. However, there was no significant difference in any
of the metacognitive monitoring measures between groups (all p>.10).
Conclusions: Findings suggest that the previously observed poor
awareness of cognitive functioning in patients with bipolar disorder
may be restricted to self-ratings of general or daily cognitive functioning.
In contrast, patients show preserved ability to monitor the accuracy of
performance during a specific cognitive task. This preserved metacognitive monitoring may be used to help modify inaccurate self-perceptions
of general cognitive ability in patients.

T.A. TZOURIS & S. ROGERS. The Effect Of Hallucinations on
Cognition in Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s Disease.
Objective: Significant research has been conducted on the differences in
symptomology between PD and AD; however, less clear are the unique
effects of hallucinations on cognition within the two pathologies. This
study aims to explore how hallucinations impact cognition in patients
with AD and PD.
Participants and Methods: 174 older adults (77 women, M age =
74, M education = 14.93 years) participated in neuropsychological assessment as part of outpatient neurology evaluations. Measures completed included the HVLT-R, BVMT-R, Trailmaking, BNT, RCFT,
and subtests from WAIS-IV, WMS- IV, and DKEFS. Participants also
indicated the presence and type of hallucinations in clinical interviews
and questionnaires.
Results: Hallucinations were reported by 75% of those with PD and
10% of those with AD. Those with AD and hallucinations performed
significantly worse than those without hallucinations on Trails A, p
< .01, RCFT Copy, p < .03, and Trails B, p < .04. Those with PD
and hallucinations performed significantly worse on Trails A, p < .01,
DKEFS Word Reading, p < .03, HVLT-R Total Trials 1-3, p < .03,
BVMT Delayed Recall, p < .03, WAIS-IV Block Design, p < .03, Trails
B, p < .03, and RCFT Copy, 3”, and 30”, ps < .01, than those without
hallucinations.
Conclusions: The cognitive profiles of those with AD and PD appear to
vary with the presence of hallucinations. Those with AD who experience
hallucinations have significantly greater difficulties in processing speed
and select visuospatial and executive skills than those with AD who are
not experiencing hallucinations. Among those with PD, significantly
greater difficulties in attention, all visuospatial abilities, learning and
delayed recall, and select executive skills occur when hallucinations
are present. This suggests that neuropsychiatric features should not be
seen merely as symptomatology of AD and PD, but also as correlates or
factors influencing cognitive profiles.

T.A. TZOURIS & S. ROGERS. The Effects of Hallucinations and
Delusions on the Cognition of Older Adults.
Objective: Neuropsychiatric symptoms impact cognition, but less has
been done to examine the relationship between cognition and both hallucinations and delusions. This study explores how the presence and
type of hallucination and delusion impacts cognition in older adults.
Participants and Methods: 174 older adults (97 men, M age = 74, M
education = 14.93 years) participated in neuropsychological assessment
as part of outpatient neurology evaluations. Measures completed included the HVLT-R, BVMT-R, Trailmaking, BNT, RCFT, and subtests
from WAIS-IV, WMS- IV, and DKEFS. Participants also indicated the
presence and type of hallucinations and delusion in clinical interviews
and questionnaires.

283
Results: Those with hallucinations performed worse than those without
on Trails A, DKEFS Color Naming and Word Reading, WAIS-IV Block
Design, ROCF Copy, and Trails B, all ps < .01. Patients with auditory
compared to visual hallucinations showed worse WAIS-IV Digit Span
and BNT, ps < .03. Those with delusions performed worse than those
without on WAIS-IV Digit Span and Similarities, BNT, and HVLT-R
Trials 1-3 Total, all ps < .04. Lower scores on HVLT-R Total Trials
1-3 and Delayed Recall, BVMT-R Delayed Recall, WAIS-IV Picture
Completion, and RCFT Copy, all ps < .03, were experienced by those
with persecutory relative to other delusions.
Conclusions: Older adults with hallucinations and delusions appear to
experience unique deficits in cognition. Those with a history of hallucinations have greater difficulties in processing speed and select visuospatial and executive abilities. Those with a history of delusions experience greater difficulties in attention, verbal list learning, confrontation
naming, and verbal abstraction. Having auditory compared to visual
hallucinations and persecutory compared to other delusions seems to be
associated with worse cognitive functioning. The presence and type of
hallucination and delusion therefore seem to uniquely relate to cognition
in a way that may aid assessment and treatment.

N.P. VADHAN, C.M. CORCORAN, G. BEDI, J.G. KEILP &
M. HANEY. Acute Neurocognitive Effects of Smoked Marijuana
in Prodromal Psychosis.
Objective: Marijuana (MJ) use is thought to be psychotogenic in individuals who are at-risk for psychosis. The purpose of this novel study
was to examine the acute neurocognitive effects of smoked MJ in MJ
users at clinical high-risk for psychosis (CHR) and healthy MJ-using
controls, under controlled laboratory conditions.
Participants and Methods: Five CHR MJ users, as ascertained by
formal criteria, and 6 control MJ users participated in this 2-session
outpatient study. The groups were similar (p>0.05) in demographic
characteristics (mean age=23.8; SD=3.3) and MJ use (mean weekly
occasions =3.9; SD=1.8); no participant was seeking treatment for MJ
abuse. In each session, volunteers completed a battery of measures before and after smoking half of a single MJ cigarette using a standardized procedure. MJ cigarettes were provided by the National Institute
on Drug Abuse, and administration order (0.0 or 5.5% Δ9-THC) was
randomized and double-blind. Data from computerized tasks measuring
selective attention, working memory and subjective effects, as well as
heart rate data, were analyzed.
Results: Following active MJ (relative to placebo), the CHR group exhibited: 1) increased reaction time on the Stroop Color-Word (p<0.05)
and “A not B” Logical Reasoning (p=0.06) tasks, and 2) self-ratings
of psychotic-like states (p<0.05); the control group did not (p>0.05).
Both groups exhibited Δ9-THC – dependent increases (p<0.05) in heart
rate, and ratings of intoxication (“I feel high”), with the effects more
pronounced in the CHR group. All drug effects returned to baseline by
the end of each session, and no serious adverse effects of study participation occurred.
Conclusions: Consistent with our hypotheses, the CHR marijuana
smokers exhibited temporary decreases in cognitive performance and
increases in self-rated psychotic states during marijuana intoxication,
while control MJ smokers did not. These results may be consistent with
a psychotogenic role for MJ use in individuals who are already in the
prodromal phase of psychosis.

Role of Neurocognition, Psychiatric Symptoms, and Substance Use
in Predicting Social and Occupational Functioning in a Marginally
Housed Sample.
Objective: Neurocognition is an important predictor of social and occupational functioning in several clinical populations, but its influence
on “real world” functioning in a marginally housed population with
complex multimorbid health issues is unclear. This study investigated
the role of neurocognition in predicting functioning, after accounting for
substance use, psychiatric symptoms and diagnoses, and viral infections.
Participants and Methods: Participants were recruited from single-room occupancy hotels (N = 192; age: 23-67; 148 M). Baseline assessments of neurocognitive function, psychiatric disorders, positive and
negative symptoms of schizophrenia, and viral infection were conducted,
as well as monthly assessments of substance use. Ratings with the Social
and Occupational Functioning Assessment Scale were performed at 6
months. Hierarchical regression was used to examine the extent to which
baseline neurocognition explained variance in functioning at 6-month
follow-up, after accounting for the effects of substance use, psychiatric
illness, and viral infections.
Results: Better cognitive control (i.e., Stroop Color-Word task; β = .21;
p < .01) and less heroin use (β =-.23, p < .01) predicted better functioning, whereas having more positive and negative symptoms and the
presence of a schizophrenia or schizoaffective diagnosis predicted poorer
functioning (R2 = .13, F(3,186) = 4.48; p < .01). Importantly, cognitive
control explained an additional 3.7% of the variance, after accounting
for the other health-related variables (F(1,185) = 8.16; p < .01).
Conclusions: In this multimorbid sample, cognitive control, substance
use, and psychiatric factors, but not viral infections, influenced ratings
of social and occupational functioning, and are potential targets for
intervention to improve the real world function of marginalized populations. Importantly, aspects of executive functioning (i.e., cognitive
control) predicted functioning within the context of other health issues.

C.B. WOOLVERTON, N. BREITBORDE & E. GLISKY. Selfimagining Improves Memory in Individuals with First-episode
Psychosis.
Objective: A form of self-referential processing called self-imagination
provides a significant mnemonic benefit for memory in both individuals with traumatic brain injury and older adults. Previous studies of
self-referential processing in individuals with psychosis have found
mixed results in this population, often finding no benefit for memory
as a result of relating to-be-learned material to the self. The present
study investigates the effectiveness of self-imagination, a technique that
combines self-reference with imagery, in individuals with first-episode
psychosis (FEP) as compared to individuals without psychosis.
Participants and Methods: Our current sample of 14 individuals with
FEP met DSM-IV criteria for a schizophrenia-spectrum disorder or
affective disorder with psychotic features with a first onset of symptoms
within the past 5 years. Participants encoded neutral and emotional
(negative) sentences under three processing conditions: baseline (counting syllables), semantic elaboration, and self-imagination, followed by
a yes/no recognition test.
Results: Overall, memory performance was highest in the self-imagination condition for both groups, although there was an interaction
between condition and group. Recognition for sentences in the self-imagination condition among individuals with FEP was significantly better
than baseline, but not better than semantic elaboration, whereas individuals without psychosis showed better performance in self-imagination
relative to the semantic and baseline conditions.

There was also a main effect of emotion, which interacted with group:
Although both groups showed better memory for emotional than neutral
sentences, the emotion enhancement effect was greater in individuals
with FEP than individuals without psychosis.
Conclusions: These results demonstrate that individuals with FEP benefit from self-imagination, although to a lesser extent than controls. In
addition, they show a substantial emotion enhancement effect, greater
than that seen in individuals without psychosis.

P.T. CIRINO, J. MICIAK, Y. AHMED, E.H. GERST & P. TAYLOR. A
Structural Framework for Executive Functions in Children.
Objective: Executive functions (EF) are domain general control processes important for managing goal directed behavior. EFs have traditionally been approached in neuropsychology via their relation to
the frontal lobes, but similar constructs have also considered from the
perspective of cognitive psychology (e.g., working memory), or from
developmental or educational perspectives (e.g., self-regulation). There
have been older (e.g., Brown, 1987) and newer (e.g., Ylvisaker & Feeney, 2002) attempts to integrate these perspectives. The goal here is to
evaluate the structural relations among 8 domains of EF.
Participants and Methods: The sample included 846 students in
grades 3 to 5, from 19 public schools. The sample was evenly boys and
girls, and diverse ethnically (Hispanic, 52%; African American, 29%;
White, 18%); most were low income (79% reduced lunch). There were
34 measures selected from 8 domains (working memory, inhibition,
shifting, planning, fluency, self-regulated learning, metacognition, and
behavioral regulation) reflecting different perspectives on EF. The primary approach was confirmatory factor analysis, with and without a
bifactor component.
Results: The structure was similar to the proposed framework, with
some exceptions. A correlated factor model produced strong latent correlations among several of the factors. The best fitting model was a bifactor model with 6 specific factors (shifting, working memory storage/
planning, working memory update/inhibition, fluency, self-regulated
learning, metacognition), χ2(301) = 604, RMSEA = .035, SRMR =
.063, CFI = .947.
Conclusions: These results extend previous work in preschool children
(where unitary models predominate), and in adults (where separable
factors predominate). Results are conceptually consistent with the unity/
diversity model of Miyake and Friedman (2012), though with different patterning of specific factors. The results emphasize the challenge
of combining specific measurement with global inferencing, with both
theoretical and clinical implications.

K.E. JONES, T. KORIAKIN, H. SCHNEIDER, M. MAHONE
& L.A. JACOBSON. Preliminary Validation of the BRIEF-2:
Examination of Profiles Among ADHD Subtypes.
Objective: The BRIEF-2 introduces changes to the original BRIEF including reduced number of items and reorganized scales and indices.
BRIEF-2 indices include Behavior Regulation (BRI), Emotion Regulation (ERI), Cognitive Regulation (CRI) and the Global Executive
Composite. The present study investigated patterns among scales and
indices of the BRIEF-2 in youth with and without symptoms of ADHD.

Forty Fourth Annual INS Meeting Abstracts
Participants and Methods: Participants included caregivers of 1,846
youth (65.2% male), ages 5 to 18 years (M=10.41, SD=3.18), referred
for outpatient neuropsychological assessment at a hospital-based clinic,
for whom ADHD Rating Scale-IV, Impairment Rating Scale, and BRIEF
data were available. Participants were categorized using DSM-5 ADHD
criteria, caregiver-report symptom count on the ADHD Rating Scale-IV,
and impairment in at least one domain. Four groups were obtained:
inattentive (ADHD-I; n=504), hyperactive/impulsive (ADHD-HI;
n=79), combined (ADHD-C; n=313), and non-ADHD clinical comparison (n=950).
Results: Children with higher activity/impulsivity ratings (ADHD-C:
M=74.12; ADHD-HI: M=71.37) were rated as higher than those without
(ADHD-I: M=60.28; Non-ADHD: M=54.66) on the BRI (all p<0.001).
For the new ERI, children with higher activity/impulsivity ratings
(ADHD-C: M=70.94; ADHD-HI: M=68.35) were rated as showing
greater emotional dyscontrol than those without (ADHD-I: M=61.85;
Non-ADHD: M=57.09; all p<0.001). Children with higher inattention
ratings (ADHD-I: M=71.08; ADHD-C: M=71.91) showed greater elevation on the CRI than less inattentive children (ADHD-HI: M=6.52;
non-ADHD: M=59.05; all p<0.001). A similar pattern was observed
across the subscales that comprise the respective indices.
Conclusions: Results suggest that reorganization of the indices on the
BRIEF-2 may be helpful in distinguishing associated characteristics of
DSM-5 ADHD subtypes. Additional work is needed to investigate the
degree to which the ERI and BRI are dissociable in clinical populations.

L. KENWORTHY & S. GUY. Profiles of Everyday Executive
Function with the BRIEF2.
Objective: We examined profiles of everyday executive function in children with different developmental disorders on the BRIEF2.
Participants and Methods: Three separate profile analyses, one for
each of the Parent, Teacher and Self-Report Forms, compared BRIEF2
ratings among children diagnosed with ADHD-C (n = 218 parents; 110
teachers; 22 self-report), ADHD-I (n = 159 parents; 113 teachers; 71
self-report), ASD (n = 262 parents; 106 teachers; 22 self-report), LD (n
= 113 parents; 100 teachers; 27 self-report), and gender matched typically developing children (n = 752 parents; 429 teachers; 142 self-report) via mixed-model MANOVA with diagnostic group as the between
and BRIEF2 scales as the within subjects variables.
Results: All main effects and interactions were significant (p < .001)
for each of the Parent, Teacher, and Self-Report forms. Profiles of scale
elevations varied between diagnostic groups. The groups differed in
overall level of elevation with ADHD-C and ASD groups rated as having
much greater executive difficulties overall. ADHD-C was defined by
highest scores on Inhibit across all three raters while the ASD group
had the highest scores on the Shift scale, and both had the highest elevations on the Self-Monitor scale relative to other groups. Most groups
were similarly elevated on the Working Memory, Plan Organize, and
Task-Monitor scales with the exception of the LD group which had more
modest elevations. The highest elevation for all clinical groups on the
Self-Report Form was on the Task Completion scale.
Conclusions: Findings are consistent with the notion that different
diagnostic groups may have characteristic profiles of executive function
strengths and weaknesses. That these are measurable on the BRIEF2
contributes to the body of evidence for valid interpretation of BRIEF2
scores in children with a wide range of disorders.

for the BRIEF2.
Objective: International growth in educational, medical and research

children at risk for executive deficits. We describe the development and
validation of screening forms for the BRIEF2.
Participants and Methods: BRIEF2 items were examined in over 5000
normative and clinical cases. Factor analysis and item-total correlations identified small but sensitive item sets reflecting behavior, emotion
and cognitive regulation. Reliabilities were examined in standardization
samples (N=1,400 Parent /Teacher Versions; N=803 Self Report Version). Test-retest reliabilities were examined in 163 parent, 173 teacher
and 190 self-report forms. Validity was evaluated based on item content,
internal structure, relations with other measures, prediction of BRIEF2
scores, and clinical sensitivity.
Results: Parallel 12-item Parent, Teacher and Self-Report screening
forms had good internal consistency (.87-.91), interrater (.40-.80) and
test-retest (.79-.87) reliabilities in normative samples. CFA statistics indicated appropriate internal structure. Screening form scores correlated
well with externalizing scales of behavior measures (e.g., BASC2) but
less so with internalizing scales and very little with IQ measures (e.g.,
RIAS). BRIEF2 Screening Form scores correlated highly (>.90) with
the BRIEF2 Global Executive Composite. Base rates of elevated scores
were very low in typically developing children and significantly higher
in clinical groups.
Conclusions: Evidence supports use of BRIEF2 screening forms for
identifying children at risk for executive function difficulties who may
need further assessment. The screening forms are not stand-alone comprehensive measures of executive function, but are useful for research
and broad educational screening where reduced respondent burden is
prioritized and a global estimate of executive function is desired. The full
BRIEF2 is recommended for individual clinical or school assessments.

Symposium 14. Driving is More Than Cognition:
Integrating Evidence Across Neuropsychological
Populations

M.T. SCHULTHEIS, E. WHIPPLE, A. RAPHAIL, A.C. GRAEFE,
K. PATRICK & M.T. SCHULTHEIS. Driving is more than cognition:
Integrating evidence across neuropsychological populations.
Symposium Description: Driving an automobile is a complex behavior. Assessment of driving after neurological compromise is a challenging
task faced by many clinicians, including neuropsychologists. Despite
being a common clinical concern, the neuropsychological driving research has been primarily limited to identifying neurocognitive tests
for predicting this everyday function. However, neuropsychology can
provide essential information about brain-behavior relationships related
to this complex behavior that go well beyond only assessing cognition.
This symposium will include findings from studies conducted over the
past 8 years, which have focused on driving capacity in neuropsychologically-compromised populations. The symposium integrates findings
across various clinical group, including discussion of degree of clinical
compromise and additional contributions (e.g., emotional, social, motor)
to driving performance. Specifically, the symposium will present 1)
how using driving simulation technology across populations can provide
new evidence-based metrics to better define the complexity of driving
ability, 2) research with veterans with TBI/PTSD that demonstrate the
intermittent but relevant impact of anxiety and other psychological

286
conditions on driving, 3) research with drivers with MS that demonstrate the importance of integrating medical measures to capture both
cognitive and physical impairments and to monitor the need for repeated
driving assessment, 4) findings from drivers with ADHD that highlight
how driving performance may not be directly associated with hallmark
cognitive deficits of disorders, and 5) research with novice drivers with
autism that demonstrate the importance of early assessment to inform
driver training goals for young drivers. The presentation will conclude
with a question and answer session to encourage dialogue challenges
in contributing to the driving assessment process (e.g., new tools for
evidence-based clinical recommendations and informing policy).

E. WHIPPLE, M.T. SCHULTHEIS & K.M. ROBINSON. The
relationship between anxiety and driving performance in combat
veterans with PTSD and TBI.
The emotional and cognitive sequalae of both traumatic brain injury
(TBI) and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) appear to contribute
to combat veterans’ increased risk of motor vehicle accidents, yet research defining how these factors concurrently impact driving has been
limited. This presentation will include examination of this relationship
at two levels: self-report data and objective measurement of driving
performance on a virtual reality simulator. The first phase of this study
examined combat veterans’ driving behaviors, emotions, and anxiety
levels using a novel self-report measure developed specifically for this
population. Results suggest that veterans with TBI and PTSD report
higher levels of anxiety in specific roadside environments than healthy
combat veterans, t (31) = 3.45, p = .01, d = 1.24. The second phase of
this study includes measures of emotional, physical, and neuropsychological function, followed by simulated driving tasks that include complex situations and combat-salient auditory stimuli. Skin conductance,
heart rate, and subjective ratings of anxiety serve as distress variables.
We will present case studies illustrating the relationship between external stimuli, physiological and subjective arousal levels, and changes
in driving performance. Implications for rehabilitation efforts aimed
at reducing risky driving in this population will be discussed, with a
particular focus on the importance of emotional status behind the wheel.

A.C. GRAEFE, K. VICKERS & M.T. SCHULTHEIS. Neurocognitive
Mediators of Virtual Reality Driving Behaviors and ADHD
Symptomatology in Young Adults.
Objective: Adults with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)
have higher rates of motor vehicle accidents, citations, and license revocations when compared to healthy adult drivers, yet few studies have
directly examined the impact of this disorder’s cognitive hallmarks on
negative driving outcomes. The current study systematically explores
the relationship between cognitive performance and driving behavior
in healthy control (HC) young adults (n = 17) and in those diagnosed
with ADHD (n = 21) using a Virtual Reality Driving Simulator (VRDS).
Method: Participants were administered a battery of neuropsychological
tests of sustained attention, working memory, mental flexibility, processing speed, risky decision making, and response inhibition, self-reported measures of driving behaviors and history, and a challenging
VRDS Risky Driving Task (RDT) requiring them to independently
navigate a virtual environment under timed conditions.
Results: During the RDT, participants in the ADHD group showed significantly more variability in lane position, longer time stopped at a
stoplight, and faster speed in a curved road segment when compared
to the HC group. ADHD participants were also more likely to fail to
stop at a stop sign. Multiple parallel mediation analyses showed that
ADHD diagnosis indirectly influenced lane variability through sustained
attention and working memory.
Conclusions: Though the results suggest that the ADHD group showed
poorer driving behavior than the HC group on several VRDS driving
measures, neuropsychological functioning mediated the relationship
between ADHD symptomatology and driving outcomes in only lane
variability. These results suggest that understanding the relationship
between ADHD symptomatology and driving performance requires both
further understanding of the neuropsychological profile of ADHD and
the cognitive demands of different driving environments.

M.T. SCHULTHEIS. The Effect of Symptom Severity on Driving
in Multiple Sclerosis: The Interaction Between Cognitive and
Physical Impairments in a Functional Task.
Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a progressive disorder that affects cognitive
and physical abilities. Previous research has demonstrated that MS
related impairment can negatively impact everyday functioning such
as driving, a complex behavior that relies on cognition (i.e, attention,
information processing speed) and physical ability (i.e., turning wheel,
pushing pedals). This presentation will briefly summarize our previous research examining driving behaviors among individuals with MS.
Specifically, we will focus on recent findings utilizing a virtual reality
driving simulator (VRDS) to objectively examine driving behaviors and
its relationship with cognitive and physical symptoms at varying levels
of severity. The results indicate that individuals with MS demonstrated
reduced lane management as MS symptoms became more severe when
measured with the Multiple Sclerosis Functional Composite (MSFC; r =
-.45, p = .02). By contrast, when MS symptoms were measured with the
Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS), a commonly used measure of
severity, the relationship was not found (r = -.16, p = .59). The difference in findings may be due to the EDSS’s primary focus on physical
impairment, whereas the MSFC captures both cognitive and physical
impairment. Combined, the data underscore the need for defining the
best metrics for measuring functional behaviors, such as driving, and

K. PATRICK, F. AGATE, M.D. MCCURDY, F. HUREWITZ &
M.T. SCHULTHEIS. Autism Spectrum Disorders and Driving:
Cognitive and Social Impairment May Impact Driver Training.
Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is associated with impairments in a
variety of skills that are likely to impact driving performance including
social functioning, processing speed, attention, and executive functioning. Although individuals with ASD and their parents report more difficulty with driving than typically developing peers (Cox et al., 2012;
Daly et al., 2014), driving behaviors of novice drivers with ASD have
yet to be objectively measured. This presentation will include findings
from virtual reality driving simulator data of 50 novice drivers with ASD
(age range: 16-26) compared to typically developing controls matched
on age, gender, IQ, and driving history. Participants first completed a
baseline rural drive and then drove the same route while engaging in
realistic distractor tasks (e.g., adjusting radio, holding conversation).
During the baseline, young adults with ASD demonstrated significantly
more variability in speed than controls (p = .02) and nearly significantly
more variability in lane positioning (p = .09). While completing distractor tasks, ASD participants demonstrated significantly more variability
in speed (p = .009) and lane positioning (p = .05). For ASD participants,
variability in speed increased from 1.68 mph to 1.93 mph and variability in lane positioning increased from 1.94 feet to 2.44 feet. However,
variability in speed and lane positioning did not change for controls. For
ASD participants, higher social impairment (ADOS) and poorer neurocognitive performance (SDMT, Stroop) were associated with greater

driving difficulties (ps < .05). Results suggest that basic driving skills
may be more difficult for novice drivers with ASD, particularly those
with greater ASD severity and neurocognitive impairment. Implications
for driving training, including using a gradual, hierarchical approach to
driver’s education and limiting distractions, will be discussed.

Imaging in Children with TBI.
Objective: Memory complaints are common among children with traumatic brain injury (TBI).
Participants and Methods: The Good Teacher Test of Non-Verbal
Recognition Memory (GTT; Roberson & Hanten, 2003), a test which
measures facial recognition memory, was administered to 21 (7F/14M)
children aged 10–18 years, who sustained moderate to severe TBI as
toddlers and were scanned 5-15 years later. The comparison group was
20 (6F/14M) typically-developing children, matched on gender, age,
SES, and ethnicity. We examined group differences in GTT performance
and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI)-derived fractional anisotropy (FA)
and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) of the corpus callosum (CC),
frontal white matter (FWM), performant pathways (PP) and inferior
frontal occipital fasciculi (IFOF). DTI metrics were correlated with GTT
measures, including the number of correct “no” responses, number of
correct “yes” responses, and the total number of correct responses.
Results: On the GTT, the number of correct responses significantly differed between the TBI and controls groups (p=0.019), and the number
of correct “yes” (p=0.079) and “no” responses (p=0.092) marginally
differed. The TBI group demonstrated lower FA in the corpus callosum,
performant pathways (PP), and left frontal white matter (p<0.05), and
marginally lower FA in the left IFOF (p<0.1). Higher ADC was found
in the CC, frontal, and perforant pathway white matter (p<.05). In the
TBI group, total correct “yes” responses was correlated with CC FA and
ADC (p=0.05), and correlated with right IFOF ADC (p<0.05), such
that poorer performance was associated with decreased white matter
integrity.
Conclusions: Deficits in visual recognition memory may persist for
years following injury and may deleteriously impact academic and social
functioning. These deficits may be related to injury-induced changes in
white matter structure. These changes may be the neural mechanism
mediating poor visual recognition memory in TBI.

Skills and Diffusion Tensor Imaging in Children with TBI.
Objective: Many children with traumatic brain injury (TBI) experience
difficulties with adaptive behavior skills, including expressive and receptive communication skills, activities of daily living, and socialization.
Participants and Methods: The Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales –
II (VABS) was administered to 21 (7F/14M) children aged 10–18 years,
who sustained moderate to severe TBI as toddlers and were scanned
5-15 years later. The comparison group was 20 (6F/14M) typically-developing children, matched on gender, age, SES, and ethnicity.
We examined group differences in VABS performance and diffusion
tensor imaging (DTI)-derived fractional anisotropy (FA) and apparent

287
diffusion coefficient (ADC) of the corpus callosum (CC), frontal white
matter (FWM) and inferior frontal occipital fasciculi (IFOF). CC DTI
metrics were correlated with Daily Living Skills, FWM measures were
correlated with Social Skills and Communication, and IFOF measures
were also correlated with the Communication index.
Results: Although the Adaptive Behavior Composite did not significantly differ between groups, subscale index scores were lower in the
TBI group for Communication (p=0.011) and Social Skills domains
(p=0.035). Lower FA was evident in the CC (p=0.010) and left FWM
(p=0.050), and marginally lower in the left IFOF (p=0.063), and higher
ADC was found in the CC (p=0.0006), left FWM (p=0.007) and right
FWM (p=0.006) in the TBI group. Daily Living Skills was correlated
with CC FA (p=0.049), Social Skills was correlated with right (p=0.007)
and left (p=0.0006) FWM FA, and Communication was related to right
and left FWM FA (p=0.011) and right IFOF FA (p=0.012). Similar
relations were also seen for ADC in these regions’ corresponding domains
Conclusions: White matter changes resulting from TBI, detected by
DTI, may contribute to deficits in adaptive behavior skills later in life.
Future studies should examine how imaging-detected changes could
predict response to therapeutic strategies targeting adaptive behavior
skills in young children.

Tractography in Children Sustaining Traumatic Brain Injury at a
Young Age: The Possible Role of Plasticity.
Objective: Plasticity is often implicated in understanding post-traumatic brain injury (TBI) development in young children. However,
many analyses utilizing DTI have assumed a linear relation between
brain structure and function and do not adequately address this concept.
Participants and Methods: Cingulum bundle (CB) and perforant
pathway (PP) integrity was examined using diffusion tensor imaging
(DTI) in 21 (7F/14M) children aged 10-18 years, who sustained moderate to severe TBI as toddlers and were scanned 5-15 years later. The
control group was 20 (6F/14M) typically-developing children, matched
on gender, age, SES, and ethnicity.
Results: Despite decreased fractional anisotropy (FA) and increased
mean diffusivity (MD) in the CB and PP in group-level analyses (previously reported), we found striking qualitative differences in the tractography-generated pathways of this group of children injured during
a critical period of brain development. Over half of the TBI group exhibited embellished or elaborated CB in relation to the control group,
and the number of streamlines in the tract negatively correlated with
age at injury, where younger age was significantly associated with
greater hypertrophy (r=-0.42 for right, r=-0.48 for left), particularly
in late-developing frontal regions of the CB, though streamlines did not
relate to performance on the D-KEFS CWIT. We also observed unique
tractography patterns for the PP in the TBI group. For this structure,
there was no relation to age at injury, but the number of streamlines was
significantly related to CVLT-C total score (r=0.56), and short (r=0.59)
and long-delay (r=0.54) free recall scores.
Conclusions: DTI tractography may provide insight into dynamic postTBI development. While traditional DTI metrics demonstrate expected
relations to performance on cognitive measures in group-based studies,
the structures themselves reflect altered growth in some. Whether this
plasticity is adaptive or maladaptive, and whether this may be structure
specific, warrants further investigation.

shunt revisions predict long-term IQ and fine motor dexterity in
myelomeningocele.
Objective: Surgical shunt intervention is routinely performed in patients with spina bifida myelomeningocele (SBM) as treatment for hydrocephlaus. While deleterious effects of hydrocephalus and resultant
shunt treatment on intelligence (IQ) are established in cross-sectional
cohorts, limited longitudinal studies have examined lifespan effects of
age of initial shunt operation or number of shunt revisions on domains
of IQ or fine motor dexterity. The current study utilized a large cohort
of children and adults with SBM to determine whether shunt history
related to indices of intelligence and fine motor dexterity.
Participants and Methods: Participants with shunt treated hydrocephalus were internationally recruited as a part of two larger studies
examining neurobehavioral outcomes of SBM at two time points: T1
and T2. Participants completed neuropsychological evaluations that
included estimates of full scale (FSIQ), performance (PIQ), verbal (VIQ)
IQ and fine motor dexterity. Age of initial shunt operation and number
of shunt revisions at each time point were examined in relation to T2
IQ estimates and fine motor dexterity.
Results: Age of initial shunt insertion was not significantly associated
with number of shunt revisions at T2. Earlier age of initial shunt operation significantly predicted better fine motor dexterity at T2 similarly
for children and adults. Greater number of shunt revisions between
study time points was significantly associated with higher PIQ at T2.
Conclusions: Contrary to expectations, an earlier age of initial shunt
operation did not predict greater number of shunt revisions, although
it did significantly predict better fine motor dexterity at T2 after shunt
revisions were statistically controlled. Greater number of shunt revisions between evaluations was associated with higher PIQ scores at T2
regardless of age of initial shunt operation. These findings may indicate
better functional outcomes with consistent and well-managed treatment
for hydrocephalus.

Waiting for Liver Transplantation Predicts Long-Term Cognitive
Outcomes in Children with End-Stage Liver Disease.
Objective: Liver transplantation is now standard therapy for children
with end-stage liver disease. With survival rates improving in recent
years, focus has shifted to long-term outcomes. While it was previously assumed that patient health would recover to premorbid status
after a successful transplant, recent research suggests that end-stage
liver disease during the vulnerable period of brain development may
impart irreversible health deficits despite transplantation and medical
stabilisation. Furthermore, longer waiting times increase exposure to
the neurotoxic effects of liver disease. The aim of the study was to
investigate the impact of waiting time on outcomes for children post
liver transplantation.
Participants and Methods: Forty-three children (21 male) aged 6-16
years were assessed using a comprehensive neuropsychological battery
at least one-year post-transplant. Medical factors of interest included
days spent on organ waiting list, disease severity, and days spent in
PICU. Parent, teacher and child psychosocial questionnaires were collected. Eight children also completed MRI scans.
Results: Backward regression analyses reveal that longer waiting times
are a key predictor of poorer performance across intellectual and academic abilities: overall intelligence, verbal and perceptual intelligence,
working memory, reading, spelling, and mathematics. Participants perform significantly worse compared to the population on measures of attention, working memory, fine motor skills and mathematics, with 40%
meeting criteria for a learning disability in mathematics. Questionnaires
also suggest significantly poorer psychosocial functioning and quality

of life. MRI scans reveal overt neuropathology in the basal ganglia in
children considered stable and functioning normally.
Conclusions: This study demonstrates that longer waiting times at
transplantation predict poorer long-term cognitive outcomes.

J. SCHMAHMANN. The Cerebellar Cognitive Affective Syndrome:
Insights from Joubert Syndrome.
Objective: The role of the cerebellum in the regulation of cognition and
emotion is increasingly recognized and has been described as the cerebellar cognitive affective syndrome (CCAS). The current study characterizes the neuropsychological profile associated with Joubert syndrome
(JS), a genetic disorder that is associated with atypical development of
the cerebellum (hypoplasia of the cerebellar vermis). The disorder results
in atypical development of cognitive and motor functions, but a specific
neuropsychological profile has not been well defined and provides an
opportunity to understand how particular cerebellar networks regulate
specific aspects of behavior. The current case presentation describes the
patterns of cognitive and psychiatric functioning in three brothers with
JS who presented for clinical neuropsychological evaluation.
Participants and Methods: Three biological brothers (ages 25, 27, and
32) diagnosed with JS underwent a comprehensive neuropsychological
evaluation at Massachusetts General Hospital. Medical records were
reviewed, including genetic testing data, brain imaging, medications,
and clinical notes. Neuropsychological evaluation included assessment
of cognitive, academic, motor, psychiatric, and adaptive functioning.
Results: All patients exhibited global developmental delay. Within this
context, patients demonstrated a pattern of strengths and weaknesses
implicating disruption of pathways involving the cerebellum and frontal-subcortical networks. Specifically, the most remarkable difficulties
were in executive functioning, motor control, affective dysregulation,
and social skill development. Notably, all patients exhibited similar
neuropsychiatric symptoms and it was these symptoms that brought
them to medical attention.
Conclusions: Findings of the present work are the first to show that the
cognitive and psychiatric profiles in JS map onto the diagnostic patterns
of CCAS. Additionally, it furthers our understanding of the heterogeneous manifestations of atypical cerebellar development.

with Academic and Adaptive Functioning among Youth with
Perinatal HIV Exposure and/or Infection.
Objective: Perinatal HIV infection (PHIV) confers risk for neurocognitive impairment, potentially affecting school performance and longterm functional independence. This study examined associations of
memory and executive functioning (EF) with academic and adaptive
skills for youth with PHIV and perinatally HIV-exposed uninfected
(PHEU) youth.
Participants and Methods: Participants included youth, ages 9-<19
years, from the Pediatric HIV/AIDS Cohort Study Memory Substudy
who completed Word Reading (reading) and Numerical Operations
(math) subtests of the Wechsler Individual Achievement Test, 2nd
Ed., Abbreviated; caregivers completed the Adaptive Behavior Assessment System, 2nd Ed. (ABAS-II). Retrospective (RetM) and prospective (ProM) memory and EF were evaluated in relation to these outcomes using logistic regression models adjusted for sociodemographic
characteristics.
Results: Participants (N=258, mean age=14.1 years) were 46% male,
77% black, 18% Hispanic. Of PHIV youth (n=173), 45 (26%) had a

Forty Fourth Annual INS Meeting Abstracts
CDC Class C (AIDS-defining) diagnosis (PHIV-C). The PHIV-C group
had lower adjusted mean reading scores than PHIV-nonC (86.9 vs 93.8,
p=0.02) and PHEU youth (86.9 vs 93.2, p=0.04); mean math scores did
not differ by group. ABAS-II mean scores were within age expectations
across all groups with no significant group differences. RetM, ProM,
EF, and some demographic variables were associated with significantly
higher reading and math scores; e.g., each additional point for individual
RetM scores was associated with increases of 2-3 points in math and 1-2
points in reading (each p<0.001). The ABAS-II Composite was associated with immediate and delayed verbal memory, design recognition,
ProM, some EF measures, and caregiver education.
Conclusions: Academic and adaptive competencies were associated
with specific memory and executive functioning indices and social contextual factors, as expected, and in the case of reading, with HIV status.
Identifying areas of risk and contributing factors may inform prevention
and intervention efforts.

to Brain Aging and Alzheimer’s Disease: Evidence from Imaging
and Biomarker Studies.
Symposium Description: It is now well established that there is considerable interindividual heterogeneity in the propensity for accruing
the brain and biomarker alterations associated with normal aging
and Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Furthermore, the relationship between
AD pathology and cognitive function is imperfect. Some individuals
continue to exhibit intact cognition despite harboring substantial AD
pathophysiology. The concept of resilience has gained traction as a
harmonizing framework for describing these phenomena. Even so, some
key knowledge gaps persist. For example, there is a need to isolate the
finite set of factors that confer such resilience, and the timing of their
maximal impact. Similarly, it is unclear whether these factors only influence initial levels of functioning or whether they also modify trajectories.
Importantly, it is yet to be determined whether and to what extent
resilience can be cultivated via targeted interventions. This symposium
brings together an international collective of scientists to address these
and related questions. Dr. Prashanthi Vemuri will kick off the session
with a discussion of the potential for intellectual enrichment to mitigate
the accumulation of AD pathology. Dr. Anja Soldan will describe variations in longitudinal cognitive trajectory as a function of education and
reading ability whereas Dr. Dorene Rentz will present data indicating
that education and reading ability modify the effects of amyloid and
tau pathologies on cognitive function. Ms. Stephanie Schultz will show
that aerobic fitness attenuates the impact of AD susceptibility genes on
cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers of AD. Dr. Sylvie Belleville will discuss
the effects of early- and late-life cognitive stimulation on brain structure
and function among persons with subjective cognitive decline. Finally,
Dr. Ozioma Okonkwo will lead a discussion focused on the ways these
findings inform the national mandate to prevent and effectively treat
AD by 2025

and Structural-MRI) in a non-demented elderly population.
PARTICIPANTS AND METHODS: In the Mayo Clinic Study of Aging
(MCSA), we studied 393 non-demented (340 cognitively normal, 53
MCI) participants (70 years and older), who had cognitive and physical activity measures; and at least two visits with imaging biomarkers.
We dichotomized subjects into high (≥14 years) and low (<14 years)
education levels using the median. For the entire cohort and the two
education strata, we built linear mixed models to investigate the effect
of the predictors on each of the biomarker outcomes.
RESULTS: Age was associated with amyloid and neurodegeneration
trajectories, APOE4 status appears to influence only the amyloid and
FDG trajectories but not hippocampal volume trajectory. In the high
education stratum, high midlife cognitive activity was associated with
lower baseline amyloid deposition in APOE4 carriers. APOE4 status was
associated with lower FDG uptake in the entire cohort and in subjects
with lower education but not the high education cohort.
CONCLUSIONS: There were minimal effects of cognitive reserve on AD
biomarker trajectories (specifically rates). Lifetime intellectual enrichment (high education, high midlife cognitive activity) is associated with
lower baseline amyloid in APOE4 carriers. High education is protective
from the APOE4 effect on FDG metabolism.

Relationship between Cognitive Reserve and Longitudinal Change
in Cognition in Middle-Aged and Older Adults.
Objective. We examined if baseline level of cognitive reserve (CR) modifies the rate of change in cognition over time among middle-aged and
older individuals with normal cognition at baseline.
Participants and Methods. This study included 300 individuals from the
BIOCARD cohort who were cognitively normal at baseline (M baseline
age = 57 years) and have been followed prospectively for up to 19 years
(M = 10 years) with annual clinical and cognitive assessments; 70 participants have developed MCI or AD dementia over time.
CR was indexed with a composite score combining education and
baseline scores on the National Adult Reading Test and vocabulary.
Cognitive performance was measured by a composite based on four
tests previously shown to predict progression from normal cognition to
mild impairment. Mixed linear regression models were used to test if
the trajectories of cognitive performance differed as a function of CR,
adjusting for age, gender, and APOE-4 status. Separate analyses were
performed for the total sample and the subgroup of individuals who
developed cognitive impairment.
Results. In the total sample, higher CR was associated with better cognitive performance, but the rate of change in cognition over time did not
differ as a function of CR. Likewise, in the subgroup of individuals who
progressed to MCI or AD dementia, cognitive trajectories did not differ
as a function of CR prior to the onset of clinical symptoms. However,
higher CR was associated with a greater decline in cognitive performance
after the clinical symptom onset of MCI.
Conclusions. These results suggest that higher CR is associated with
better cognitive performance, but CR does not modify the rate of change
in cognition prior to the onset of clinical symptoms of MCI. The data
also suggest that individuals with higher levels of CR show a more rapid

290
decline in cognition after the emergence of clinical symptoms, consistent
with previously published imaging data, and theoretical models of CR.

Cognitive Resilience in Preclinical Alzheimer’s disease: The
Association of Tau and Amyloid Burden on Cognitive Performance.
Objective: To determine the independent and reciprocal relationships
of amyloid and tau burden on cognition and whether cognitive reserve
(CR) modifies this relationship across a sample of cognitively normal
elderly (CN), and patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and
Alzheimer disease (AD) dementia.
Participants and Methods: A total of 126 subjects (CN=111, MCI=17,
mild AD=6), (mean age=74.1±7.4; mean education=15.9±3.1) underwent neuropsychological testing (NP) and positron emission tomography examining amyloid beta (Aβ) deposition using Pittsburgh Compound B (PiB PET) and inferior temporal tau deposition using T807
Tau PET (INF Tau). Education and the AMNART IQ were explored
separately as a proxy of CR. Multiple Linear Regression models related
NP to T807 Tau deposition in the inferior temporal lobe (IFT Tau)
and to PiB PET Aβ in an aggregate of AD cortical regions. In separate
models predicting NP we examined both the CR x Aβ interaction and
the CR x INF Tau interaction (controlling for age, education, AMNART
IQ and clinical status).
Results: In separate models, both higher Aβ (β=-1.8,p<0.002) and INF
Tau (β=-4.2, p<0.0001) predicted lower NP. When Aβ and INF Tau
were together in the model, INF Tau remained significant (β=-3.7,
p<0.0001) but Aβ was non-significant (β=-0.5, p=0.383). CR modified the relationship of Aβ and NP (β=0.1, p=0.042) as well as INF Tau
and NP (β=0.1, p=0.003).
Conclusions: Higher Aβ and INF Tau were both associated with lower
NP, however, higher INF Tau had a stronger and more direct association with poorer cognition than Aβ burden. These findings support the
hypothetical AD model that Aβ deposition occurs at an earlier stage than
INF Tau but that INF Tau deposition is more directly concurrent with
cognitive decline. CR modified the association between NP, Aβ and INF
Tau burden suggesting that CR may be protective against Aβ and INF
Tau-related cognitive impairment.

Fitness Modifies the Association between a Polygenic Risk Score
and CSF Biomarkers in Preclinical Alzheimer’s Disease.
OBJECTIVE: The APOE ε4 allele is the strongest genetic risk factor for
late-onset Alzheimer’s disease (AD). However, recent studies suggest
that CLU and ABCA7 which, like APOE, are in the lipid metabolism
pathway may also play an important role in AD. Furthermore, exercise
is a promising approach for altering AD-related changes. Accordingly,
we examined (1) whether a polygenic risk score (PRS), derived from
APOE, CLU, and ABCA7, is associated with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)
biomarkers of AD, and (2) whether higher cardiorespiratory fitness
(CRF) modifies the association between the PRS and CSF biomarkers.
PARTICIPANTS & METHODS: Ninety-five enrollees in the Wisconsin
Registry for Alzheimer’s Prevention were genotyped for APOE, CLU,
and ABCA7, from which a PRS was calculated for each participant.
They underwent lumbar puncture for collection of CSF. Amyloid-β42
(Aβ42), Aβ40, total tau (t-tau), and phosphorylated tau (p-tau) were
immunoassayed. Aβ42/Aβ40 and tau-to-Aβ42 ratios were also computed. CRF was estimated using a validated equation incorporating sex,

age, body-mass index, resting heart rate, and self-report PA. Covariate-adjusted regressions tested for associations between the PRS and
CSF biomarkers. Where significant, we tested whether these associations
were modified by CRF by including PRS*CRF term in the models.
RESULTS: A higher PRS was associated with lower Aβ42/Aβ40
(p<.001), higher t-tau/Aβ42 (p<.001), and higher p-tau/Aβ42
(p=.001). Furthermore, we observed significant PRS*CRF interactions for Aβ42/Aβ40 (p=.014), t-tau/Aβ42 (p=.002), and p-tau/Aβ42
(p=.001). Specifically, the deleterious effect of the PRS on these CSF
biomarkers was diminished in those with higher CRF.
CONCLUSION: In a late-middle-aged cohort, aerobic fitness attenuates
the adverse influence of genetic vulnerability on CSF biomarkers. These
findings support the notion that leading a physically-fit lifestyle may be
beneficial to those at increased genetic risk for AD.

S. BELLEVILLE, B. BOLLER, S. MELLAH & E. OUELLET. Earlyand Late-Life Cognitive Stimulation: Effects on Brain Structure
and Function and Relation to Reserve Models.
OBJECTIVES: Individuals vary in their resistance to age-related brain
changes. One hypothesis is that exposure to favourable lifestyles¬—
here, cognitive stimulation—determines brain differences that contribute to resilience. However, the neurobiological mechanisms by which
this occurs remain elusive. Cognitive stimulation can be provided early
in life through formal education, or later in life through cognitive training. In this conference, we will assess the brain changes that are produced by memory training and compare these with the brain differences
associated with different levels of education.
PARTICIPANTS: Community-dwelling older adults with a subjective
cognitive complaint and different levels of formal education.
METHOD: In study 1, older adults were scanned with a Siemens 3-T
MRI to assess corrected brain volume (grey and white matter) and regional cortical thickness, as a function of level of formal education. In
study 2, participants were trained with the method of LOCI (6 sessions).
Functional activation was measured at three time points: pre-, mid-, and
post-training, to assess the effects of training on task-related activation,
and whether formal education modulates functional brain responses to
cognitive training.
RESULTS: Study 1 showed an age by education interaction on
grey-matter volume. The age-related effect on grey matter volume was
only found in those with lower education. There was no education effect
on white matter volume. In study 2, education was found to be related
to the pattern of memory-related activation, and it had a major impact
on training-related brain activation.
DISCUSSION: Education has a significant effect on brain structure and
function. Cognitive training was found to increase functional activation,
but the effect is stronger and occurs more rapidly in those with higher
education. Thus, memory training might potentiate rather than mitigate
the effects of brain reserve.

R.J. ANDREWS, C.E. JACKSON, C.B. FORTIER, W.P. MILBERG
& R. MCGLINCHEY. Prediction of Neurobehavioral Symptom
Inventory Total Score Using Psychological and TBI Measures.
Objective: Evidence indicates that factors not related to a TBI may
affect post-concussive symptom (PCS) reporting. The Neurobehavioral
Symptom Inventory (NSI) is a 22-item self-report measure of PCS. The
current study aimed to identify the best predictors of total score of the
NSI from multiple TBI, psychiatric, and physical health symptoms.
Participants and Methods: Participants included 369 Veterans of
Operations Enduring Freedom (OEF), Iraqi Freedom (OIF), and New
Dawn (OND) enrolled in the VA RR&D TRACTS longitudinal research
study. Structured clinical interviews assessed TBI (Boston Assessment
of TBI-Lifetime; BAT-L), and psychiatric conditions (Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale; CAPS). Self-report questionnaires assessed
functioning (Depression Anxiety Stress Scales; DASS and McGill Pain
Questionnaire).Linear regression models predicting NSI total score were
created to determine which measures were most predictive of NSI total
score. Three linear regression models were evaluated: 1) TBI factors, 2)
non-TBI factors, and 3) a combined TBI and non-TBI model.
Results: TBI factors alone significantly predicted NSI total score
(p<.001), but only accounted for 8.6% of the variance in NSI total
score. Non-TBI factors accounted for 79.7% of the variance (p<.001).
The combined TBI and non-TBI factor model accounted for 80.6% of
the variance (p<.001). In the final combined model, current CAPS score,
DASS (Anxiety, Depression, Stress subscales), and McGill Pain current
total score, as well as the number of blast-related TBI’s were significant
predictors of NSI total score.
Conclusions: These results exemplify the robust impact of non-TBI
factors, particularly PTSD, anxiety, depression, stress, and pain, on
post-concussive reporting. Findings underscore the need to evaluate
and consider the possible effects of these non-TBI factors on post-concussive reporting, particularly given the health implications and possible secondary gain if an individual is identified as experiencing lasting
symptoms related to a TBI.

& R.M. BAUER. “Playing Through It”: Delayed Reporting and
Removal from Athletic Activity Following Concussion Predicts
Prolonged Recovery.
Objective: Preclinical research has suggested a window of vulnerability
for exacerbated injury when activity is resumed or continued in the
immediate aftermath of concussion. The extent to which these findings
translate to humans is unknown. This study examined the impact on
recovery time of delayed reporting/removal from athletic activity after
concussion.
Participants and Methods: We employed a cross-sectional design using retrospective injury records from college athletes. Ninety-seven (97)
athletes who sustained a sport-related concussion between 2008 and
2015 were analyzed (age=20.4±1.3 years). Two groups were formed:
athletes who reported concussion symptoms immediately (I-RFA) vs.
those who did not (D-RFA). The number of days between the concussion
event and clearance for return to participation was recorded. Group

differences in incidence of Prolonged (8 or more days) versus Normal
(7 or fewer days) recovery were also analyzed.
Results: Fifty (51.5%) of the 97 athletes did not immediately report
concussion symptoms and remained active in the immediate aftermath.
D-RFA athletes averaged 4.9 more Days Missed than I-RFA athletes.
RFA group significantly predicted Days Missed even after controlling for
gender, concussion history, LD/ADHD diagnosis, psychiatric diagnosis,
and acute symptom severity (R2change=.097, β=.319, p=.002). D-RFA
athletes were approximately 2.2 times more likely to have a prolonged
recovery than were I-RFA athletes (χ2=10.268, p=.001, φ=.325, medium effect size).
Conclusions: Athletes who did not immediately report concussion had
prolonged recovery compared to athletes who immediately reported
symptoms and were removed from activity, as predicted by preclinical
models of acute post-injury vulnerability. Continuing to participate in
athletic activity during the immediate post-concussion period potentially
exposes the already injured brain to additional neuronal stress that can
compound injury neuropathophysiology and prolong recovery.

K. SCHWAB & J.M. BAILIE. Construct Validity and Factor
Structures of the Automated Neuropsychological Assessment
Metrics.
Objective: The Automated Neuropsychological Assessment Metrics
version 4 (ANAM4) is a computerized neurocognitive test used by the
Department of Defense as a pre-deployment screening tool to establish
baseline performance and screen for cognitive changes following head
injury. The purpose of this study is to explore the construct validity and
identify underlying factor structures of the battery.
Participants and Methods: ANAM4 cognitive module consists of 7
measures (basic speed 1 & 2=SRT & SR2, memory=CDS, delayed memory=CDD, processing speed=PRO, working memory=MTH, visuospatial
memory=MSP). Each measure provides 2 distinct scores, reaction time
(RT) and accuracy. Participants were service members (SM) at Fort
Bragg. Non-TBI group consisted of 1206 SM with no history of TBI;
mean age of 28.6 years (SD=6.9). TBI group consisted of 150 SM with
acute TBI; mean age of 25.5 years (SD=6.2). Groups were comparable
in level of education, years of active duty service, and history of deployment outside of the US.
Results: RT was significantly slower for the TBI group for all ANAM4
measures (p’s <.0001). Large effect sizes were observed for CDS
(d=.80), PRO (d=.96), MSP (d=.89), CDD (d=.85), and SR2 (d=1.15).
Accuracy scores were significantly different for 4 of the 7 scales (PRO,
MTH, MSP, SR2), with small effect sizes (d<.26). RT was able to differentiate between TBI and non-TBI better than Accuracy; therefore the 7
RT variables were entered into exploratory factor analysis (EFA). EFA
resulted in a 2-factor solution accounting for 99% of the total variance.
Factor 1 included RT for speeded tasks and Factor 2 included RT for
memory related tasks.
Conclusions: This study extended evidence for the construct validity
of the ANAM4 by demonstrating that RT measures are particularly
sensitive to TBI. Factor analysis indicates that seven RT measures can
be summarized extremely well by two factors (Speeded Tasks and Memory Tasks). This factor structure should be validated in confirmatory
analyses.

V. BALASUBRAMANIAN. Lexical and Syntactic Processing in Left
and Right Brain Damaged Adults.
Objective: This study verifies the prediction that damage to anterior
or posterior areas of the left hemisphere (ALH, PLH) or damage to the
right hemisphere (RH) will not result in significant differences among
these groups in auditory comprehension of sentences with lexical, or
deep structure ambiguities (LA & DSA). Comprehension of such sentences depends on, besides the cognitive resources, the activation of lexical meanings, and logical, underlying structures, respectively. Bilateral
processing of lexical ambiguity and complex sentence structures were
reported in earlier literature (Klepousniotou, Gracco, & Pike, 2014; Just
et al, 1996; Chiarello et al, 2001).
Participants and Methods: Eight normal controls (NO), seven right
hemisphere damaged (RH), eleven anterior left hemisphere damaged
(ALH) and eight posterior left hemisphere damaged patients served as
subjects in this study. A set of 20 ambiguous sentences, 10 in each type
was pooled from previous studies. A set of four pictures was drawn for
each sentence (two of them truly represented the two meanings of the
target sentence, one shared some aspects of the meaning and the other
was quite unrelated to the target sentence. On hearing each stimulus
sentence the subject was to point to the two pictures from among the
four that represented the two meanings of the sentence. Each correct
response (pointing to two appropriate pictures for each sentence) was
given one point.
Results: Multiple comparison tests (Games-Howell) at the alpha = 0.05
level of significance indicates that on test DSA the normal scores were
significantly higher than those of the other groups, but the other three
groups were not significantly different from each other. On the LA test,
however, the NO scores were not significantly different from the RH,
PLH, and ALH scores.
Conclusions: Processing sentences with DSA requires bilateral hemispheric participation, a finding that confirms previous studies. Lexical
ambiguity task was apparently not challenging to the brain damged
groups.

S.J. BANKS, J.B. MILLER & C. BERNICK. Admitted AnabolicAndrogenic Steroid Use in Professional Fighters: Relationship
with Hippocampal Volume and Cognition.
Objective: Anabolic-androgenic steroid (AAS) use occurs in competitive
sports, but there is very little published research on the impact of these
drugs on brain and cognition in humans. Animal studies suggest a specific impact of AAS use on hippocampal activity and function. Here we
report on differences in hippocampal volume between admitted steroid
users and deniers in a large cohort of professional boxers and mixed
martial arts fighters.
Participants and Methods: 30 fighters who admitted to AAS use, and
430 fighters who denied use, were compared. There were more MMA
fighters compared to boxers in the steroid admitter group. Thus, we
analyzed both the whole group together, and boxers and MMA fighters
separately. We used t tests to compare mean volumes of the hippocampus and thalamus, and scores on four cognitive scores.
Results: There were no differences in mean age (mean age: AAS admitters = 27.85, deniers= 28.25), education, or experience fighting. No
differences were evident between groups on cognitive scores. However,
there were significant differences in the left thalamus (p=.045), left
hippocampus (p=.007), and right hippocampus (p=.005), and a trend
level difference in the left amygdala. In all cases, steroid admitters had
larger structures on average.
Conclusions: A small percentage of our fighter population admitted
to AAS use. Given the stigma and legalities involved, it is likely that
some of those who denied had, in fact, used AAS. Despite this likely impure sample, we found significant differences in brain structure volume

between the two groups. Potential explanations and ramifications for
these findings will be discussed.

A. BOMBARDIER & L. DE BEAUMONT. BDNF Val66Met
polymorphism effects on neuropsychological function in
concussed athletes.
Objective: Studies on the long-term effects of sport concussion on neuropsychological function have yielded mixed results. The brain-derived
neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is implicated in cortical reorganization after
brain injury. The Val66Met polymorphism of the BDNF gene considerably reduces BDNF levels and has been shown to negatively impact
cognitive function in at-risk populations. The BDNF Val66Met polymorphism could therefore negatively affect cognitive function recovery
after a concussion. The present study aims to explore the fate of the
BDNF Val66Met polymorphism on neuropsychological tests function
in asymptomatic concussed athletes who sustained their last concussion
more than 3 months prior to testing.
Participants and Methods: 117 athletes (60 men, mean age= 20.68
; SD= 2.03) from Canadian university varsity teams took part in this
study. The protocol included a comprehensive neuropsychological tests
battery in addition to collecting a saliva sample for genetic profiling.
Participants were divided into 4 groups based on their history of concussion (concussed / unconcussed) and BDNF polymorphism (Val66Val
/ Val66Met and Met66Met). Concussed athletes were asymptomatic at
the time of testing.
Results: 2 X 2 mixed ANOVA revealed significant group (concussed
/ unconcussed) by BDNF polymorphism (Val66Val / Val66Met and
Met66Met) interactions on 4 distinct neuropsychological tests measures,
namely the Symbol Digit Modalities Test (F 3, 113 = 5.33; p = .23), the
Trail Making Test, part 1 (F 3, 113 = 4.76 ; p = .031) and part 5 (F
3, 112 = 4.75; p = 0.31) and the categorical verbal fluency (F 3, 113
= 6.95; p = 01). Main effects of BDNF polymorphism or Group did not
reach statistical significance.
Conclusions: Overall, while concussion sustained more than 3 months
prior to testing did not change neuropsychological function in BDNF
Val66Val carriers, the BDNF Val66Met polymorphism detrimentally
interacted with concussion history to induce pervasive performance alterations on frontally-mediated neuropsychological function.

L. BENNETT & D. LECHUGA. The Impact of Primary Playing
Position and Athletic Exposure on Performance Across Cognitive
Domains in Disability-Seeking Retired NFL Players.
Objective: Each year, between 1.75 and 3.5 million sports-related concussions occur. Concussion rates among players in the NFL are higher
than most other sports, with a rate of 0.41 concussions per game. Moreover, a player receives an estimated 900 to 1500 subconcussive impacts
each season. Playing position (PP) has been identified as an important
risk factor for sustaining a concussion. Those in certain positions (e.g.,
linebackers) are at greater risk of incurring both concussive and subconcussive impacts. Athletic exposure (AE), calculated using years of
NFL-play and the known risk associated with primary PP (based on
positional differences in magnitude and/or frequency of head impacts),
approximates a player’s exposure to potentially damaging head impacts. Significant discrepancies between various levels of AE and PP
were predicted on all neuropsychological outcome variables, with tasks
measuring attention, memory, executive functioning, mood impact, and
motor coordination representing the most significant inverse correlations
between AE/PP and performance.

Forty Fourth Annual INS Meeting Abstracts
Participants and Methods: 97 retired NFL players underwent neuropsychological examination as part of a worker’s compensation evaluation in the state of California. Means, medians, and ranges for 15
neurocognitive assessment measures were obtained and contrasted using
SPSS Statistics software.
Results: One-way ANOVAs were used to examine differences between
various levels of AE and PP groups on all neuropsychological outcome
variables. When F was significant, Tukey post-hoc tests were used to
examine differences between PP and AE groups. All outcome variables
were examined using GLM regressions to determine whether differences
between AE and/or PP groups may be attributable to other demographic
factors.
Conclusions: Significant AE and PP group differences were found
across numerous domains of cognitive functioning including fine motor
speed, memory, and aspects of executive functioning. Predicted impacts
of AE and PP across all neuropsychological domains were not seen.

An Individualized Quantitative Behavioral Assessment (IQBA)
Can Detect Consciousness Following Brain Injury Prior to
Standardized Assessments.
Objective: To demonstrate how brief individualized assessments can
detect consciousness following brain injury earlier than the most widely
used standardized assessment.
Participants and Methods: The study patient was a 21-year-old
Caucasian male with no notable premorbid history who sustained a
severe traumatic brain injury and subsequent anoxic injury following
cardio-pulmonary arrest 106 days post-injury. Methods included biweekly administration of the JFK Coma Recovery Scale-Revised and
an Individualized Quantitative Behavioral Assessment (IQBA) to assess
command following. The IQBA included 3 conditions: two 30-second
trials each of the correct command (X, turn your head to the right),
contra-command (X, hold still), and observation-only conditions.
Results: The IQBA was administered 22 times over 12 days, with 7
protocols removed secondary to administration errors for a total of 15
valid administrations. Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analyses
indicated good discriminability between the correct/contra-command
conditions (AUC = 0.74) and correct/observation conditions (AUC =
0.71). Responses between contra-command and observation conditions were not significantly different, and when these conditions were
collapsed, a statistically significant relationship emerged between the
command condition and frequency of movements, X2(1) = 6.94, p<.03.
Using the IQBA, the first signs of consciousness were observed 26 days
after the patient’s admission and only 12 days following IQBA institution. In contrast, the CRS-R was done 14 times starting on the day of
at admission and the first signs of consciousness noted 26 days after the
IQBA (52 days after admission). Prior to the IQBA no qualitative signs
of consciousness were noted by providers/family.
Conclusions: We were able to demonstrate that a briefer, individualized assessment could be successfully employed for the detection of
consciousness following brain injury, and much earlier than the current
gold standard assessment, the CRS-R.

A. BOUCHARD & W.D. SPAULDING. Estimating Premorbid
Intellectual Functioning in TBI Survivors with a SchizophreniaSpectrum Diagnosis: the Clinical Utility of the Wide Range
Achievement Test.
Objective: This study examines the utility of the Wide Range Achievement Test (WRAT) as an indicator of premorbid intellectual functioning

293
in survivors of traumatic brain injury (TBI) who carry a schizophrenia-spectrum diagnosis. Word reading tests, including the Reading
subtest of the WRAT, are commonly used to estimate premorbid intelligence in TBI survivors. However, people with schizophrenia-spectrum
disorders commonly exhibit cognitive impairments that interfere with
performance on these tests, raising questions about their ability to accurately estimate premorbid intellectual functioning.
Participants and Methods: Outpatients diagnosed with a schizophrenia-spectrum disorder (N=68) were administered the Reading subtest
of the Wide-Range Achievement Test, Revised 2 (WRAT-R2). History
of TBI was determined via chart review. Among this sample, 20 individuals had sustained a TBI without loss of conscious (LOC), and 8
had sustained a TBI with LOC. The remaining 40 individuals had no
known history of TBI. Groups’ mean scores were compared using oneway analysis of variance.
Results: Groups did not differ on average in terms of mean performance
on the Reading subtest of the WRAT-R2, F(2,65)=2.42, p ns. However, a declining trend was noted commensurate with injury severity,
such that mean scores were highest in the group with no TBI history
(M=69.13, SD=11.93), lower in the TBI without LOC group (M=63.16,
SD=17.45), and lowest in the group with a history of TBI with LOC
(M=57.67, SD=24.10).
Conclusions: Findings support the use of WRAT-R2 in survivors of
mild TBI who carry a schizophrenia-spectrum diagnosis. Although
groups did not differ on average in terms of their performance on the
WRAT-R2, the general trend was for individuals who sustained a TBI
with LOC to score lower on the WRAT-R2. This may reflect a power
issue, as there were only 8 individuals in the sample who had a history
of TBI with LOC. Future studies should explore the relationship between
severity of injury and WRAT-R2 performance in this population.

C.N. BRYSON, R.J. CRAMER & A. SCHMIDT. Applying the
Interpersonal Theory of Suicide to a Traumatic Brain Injury
Sample.
Objective: A history of Traumatic brain Injury (TBI) has been widely
reported to be associated with a heighten risk of suicide and suicidal
behavior. Little research has examined this relationship within the context of an empirically valid theory of suicide such as the Interpersonal
Theory of Suicide (IPTS) (Joiner, 2005). The IPTS proposes suicide as
a confluence of acquired capability (AC), thwarted belongingness (TB),
and perceived burdensomeness (PB). The current study examined the
IPTS in a group of undergraduates endorsing a history of TBI compared
to a matched control group. We hypothesized the IPTS would perform
similarly within both groups.
Participants and Methods: Participants were 84 undergraduates (42
endorsing a history of TBI and 42 controls matched on age, sex, ethnicity, and suicide exposure). Participants completed measures for PB and
TB (Interpersonal Needs Questionnaire) and AC (Acquired Capability
for Suicide Scale).
Results: Multivariate regression indicated the IPTS performed as expected within the entire sample (i.e., AC, TB, and PB all contributed
to suicide risk). There were also main effects for depression and TBI in
the model. When groups were analyzed separately, control participants
demonstrated a similar pattern as in the full sample. However, within
the TBI group, AC and TB were no longer significant predictors of
suicide risk (i.e., PB and depression accounted for most of the increase
in suicide risk within the TBI group).
Conclusions: The present findings suggest a history of TBI decreases
the influence of AC and TB on suicidality whereas depression and burdensomeness have a unique, heightened influence on suicidality within
individuals sustaining a TBI. Results point to a potential exception to
empirical support for IPTS as a universal model of suicide risk and
underscore the need for researchers and clinicians to address feelings of
burdensomeness within the family and social system of TBI survivors.

A. BUCHHOLZ, E.B. LARSON & D. RIPLEY. Actual and Perceived
Performance on Cognitive Tasks as Correlates of Subjective
Fatigue in Traumatic Brain Injury.
Objective: Though fatigue is frequently reported in patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI), the mechanisms underlying this relationship
remain unclear. To better clarify factors related to reported fatigue in
TBI patients, subjective cognitive difficulty and objective performance
on cognitive tests is examined, within the context of a larger study of
TBI.
Participants and Methods: Participants included 11 individuals
with TBI who underwent extensive evaluation including cognitive test
administration and subjective symptom reporting. Cognitive tasks included two measures of sustained attention, the paced auditory serial
addition task (PASAT) and the Conners’ Continuous Performance Test
(CPT). Performance on the PASAT was measured by change in accuracy
across trials. Performance on the CPT was measured by total omissions.
Self-report measures included the TBI Quality of Life (TBI QOL) and
the Neurobehavioral Functioning Inventory (NFI). An eight-item cognitive fatigue factor, based on face validity of item content, was created
from the TBI QOL.
Results: We ran correlational analyses examining the associations between both subjective report of difficulty with attention (a subscale
of the NFI) and performance on cognitive measures of attention and
self-report measures of fatigue. Subjective ratings of attentional difficulty were positively correlated with subjective fatigue, such that greater
self-reported attentional difficulty was correlated with increased reported fatigue. Indexes of actual poor performance on attention tasks
were negatively correlated with subjective reports of fatigue. Inaccuracy
on the PASAT was negatively correlated with subjective fatigue; greater
accuracy was associated with increased reported fatigue. CPT omissions
were negatively correlated with subjective fatigue; fewer omissions were
associated with increased reported fatigue.
Conclusions: In sum, subjective fatigue may be positively associated
with perceived difficulty and negatively associated with actual difficulty
on cognitive tasks.

M.S. CANNIZZARO, M. BREIDENSTEIN & C. CROVO. Prefrontal
Cortical Activity During Discourse Processing: Implications for
Cognitive-Communicative Impairments.
Objective: Impaired function of the prefrontal cortex (PFC) is a common occurrence following traumatic brain injury (TBI) and is often implicated in the disruption of cognitive process that directly or indirectly
interfere with complex discourse communication (e.g., conversation,
description, narrative, etc.). However, there is a paucity of information
with regard to the underlying cognitive architecture and processing
demands associated with the various forms of discourse. This is, in part,
due to methodological constraints of many neuroimaging technologies
(e.g., fMRI) that severely limit ecologically typical communication acts
such as listening and speaking during scanning. To overcome these
limitations, functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) was used to
identify patterns of neural activity related to the comprehension and
production of discourse.
Participants and Methods: Hemodynamic activity in the prefrontal
cortex was monitored during natural discourse communication using
continuous wave fNIRS in thirteen neurologically healthy adult participants. Tasks were chosen to reflect clinically useful discourse elicitation
procedures for the assessment and treatment of persons with cognitive-communicative (CC) impairments secondary to TBI. Within and

across participant comparisons were made for changes in oxygenated
hemoglobin changes across discourse tasks types.
Results: Results indicate that the comprehension of well-organized discourse text is minimally demanding on the prefrontal cortex. However,
discourse production places a significant burden on the PFC and these
processing demands generally reflect the relative complexity of the discourse task. Variability in the extent and location of these processing
demands was seen on an individual level using a statistical parametric
mapping approach.
Conclusions: These findings are discussed in terms of potential clinically relevant implications with regard to the elicitation, assessment and
remediation of CC impairments in clinical populations.

Functional Activation During Metacognitive Confidence
Judgments After Traumatic Brain Injury.
Objective: Metacognitive retrospective confidence judgments (RCJs)
are assessments of performance immediately following completion of
a cognitive task. Inaccuracies in RCJs have been observed in adults
with traumatic brain injury (TBI), but the neural mechanisms underlying these impairments remain unclear. This study utilized functional
magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to document patterns of activation
associated with making metacognitive RCJs after TBI.
Participants and Methods: Adults with TBI (GCS≤12) and healthy
adults (HC) completed a visual recognition (REC) task in a 3T scanner.
After each item of the REC task, participants reported a RCJ based
on a 4-point scale of confidence. Timing of REC and RCJ trials were
extracted to model the hemodynamic response function during these
events. fMRI data were preprocessed and analyzed using FSL FEAT
software. Cluster based thresholding was applied at the p<0.05 level.
Metacognitive accuracy was assessed by subtracting percent accuracy
of REC performance from average RCJ ratings.
Results: Compared to the REC trials, adults with TBI showed more
activation when making RCJs in the bilateral inferior parietal lobules,
bilateral middle temporal gyri, left middle frontal gyrus, right frontal
pole, bilateral precuneus (including the cingulate gyrus), and right occipital areas. Adults with TBI showed metacognitive inaccuracies and
underestimated their abilities compared to HCs (p=0.03). They also
showed less activation than HCs in the bilateral superior frontal gyri,
left frontal pole, left paracingulate gyrus, right precuneus, and right
superior parietal when making RCJs.
Conclusions: The results document a network of frontal, parietal, and
precuneus involvement in metacognitive functioning after TBI. However, adults with TBI show less activation than HCs while completing
RCJs, which may account for observed metacognitive deficits.

C. COOK & J. SUHR. Effects of Screening for Postconcussive
Syndrome (PCS) on PCS Symptom Self-Report and
Neuropsychological Test Performance.
Objective: Many non-neurological factors are related to postconcussive
syndrome (PCS) symptom report and neuropsychological test performance in mild Traumatic Brain Injury (MTBI). The use of MTBI screening instruments may also contribute to report of PCS symptoms and
neuropsychological performance. We hypothesized that false positive
PCS screening feedback would lead to higher PCS symptom report and
worse neuropsychological performance in individuals with no history
of MTBI.
Participants and Methods: Participants were 152 young adults with
no history of MTBI who scored between the 25th and 27th percentile on
a PCS measure (as determined in a pre-study screening). Participants

Forty Fourth Annual INS Meeting Abstracts
were randomly assigned to receive feedback that they had scored 1)
higher than average on a PCS screener (false positive feedback), 2)
lower than average on a PCS screener, or 3) no PCS screener feedback.
They then completed the PCS screener again (items in a new random
order) and then completed the Auditory Verbal Learning Test, with
the Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test serving as a delay. They were
then given a brief medical interview, including questions about prior
head injury history.
Results: Contrary to expectations, participants receiving false positive
feedback did not endorse more PCS symptoms than participants in the
other conditions; however, consistent with expectations, they demonstrated poorer verbal learning (p = .005)and delayed recall (p-= .04)
than participants in the “low average” feedback condition and reported
higher rates of retrospective recall of MTBI (p = .01) than participants
in the neutral condition.
Conclusions: Results suggest that feedback from screening measures
can influence individuals’ cognitive performance and retrospective recall
of their personal TBI history. Findings have implications for the use of
screening measures for PCS in clinical and research settings.

E.C. CREW, B. ASKEN, M. SULLAN, J.R. CLUGSTON &
R.M. BAUER. Acute Sleep Changes Following Sport-Related
Concussion are Associated with Increased Intra-Individual
Cognitive Variability on the ImPACT.
Objective: Increased variability in across-domain cognitive performance has been observed following sport-related concussion (SRC).
Key factors affecting post-concussion performance variability have not
been thoroughly explored. We examined whether one common symptom
–changes in sleep following SRC—affects within-domain (WD; a.k.a.,
inconsistency) and across-domain (AD; a.k.a., dispersion) cognitive
performance variability on the ImPACT.
Participants and Methods: 30 college athletes (age=20.3±1.3 years)
who sustained a SRC between 2007 and 2014 were grouped based
on presence (n=16) or absence (n=14) of reported changes in sleep
post-concussion. Baseline and acute post-concussion cognitive functioning (ImPACT) and sleep-related symptoms (Post-Concussion Scale)
were assessed. Standard scores were computed for the five composite
scores (Verbal Memory, Visual Memory, Visual Motor Speed, Reaction
Time, Impulse Control) and for each component of the six ImPACT
subtests. We derived indices of baseline/post-concussion WD and AD
performance variability and analyzed results using paired t-tests and
repeated measures ANCOVAs.
Results: For all athletes, AD variability increased significantly following
SRC. WD variability increased significantly for Verbal Memory and
Visual Motor Speed (all ps<.05). After covarying for days since injury
and magnitude of change in sleep patterns, athletes who reported sleep
changes showed greater changes in AD variability relative to baseline
(F[1,26]=98.0, p=.023, ηp2=.182). WD changes did not differ significantly between the two groups.
Conclusions: Intra-individual variability may provide unique insight
into cognitive functioning post-injury. Athletes who reported acute
changes in sleep patterns following SRC had greater AD but not WD
cognitive variability relative to athletes with unaffected sleep. Further
investigation into how post-injury sleep changes influence neurocognitive recovery from concussion is warranted, as sleep-related interventions could facilitate return to normative functioning.

L.D. CROCKER, S.M. JURICK, C. HAYS & A.J. JAK. The Role
of Depression and Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Symptoms
in Cognitive Functioning in Veterans with a History of Mild
Traumatic Brain Injury.
Objective: Accumulating evidence indicates that mental health conditions contribute to cognitive dysfunction observed in individuals with
a history of mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) reporting persistent
cognitive complaints. However, it is not known whether this is due
to general distress or disorder-specific symptoms. Thus, the present
study examined relationships between symptoms of posttraumatic stress
disorder (PTSD) and depression and neuropsychological functioning.
Participants and Methods: Participants were Veterans with a history
of mTBI (N=260) seeking outpatient services who completed a clinical neuropsychological evaluation. Correlation and regression analyses
were conducted to examine the overlapping and unique contributions
of symptoms of depression and PTSD on several domains of cognitive
functioning.
Results: General distress was negatively correlated with objective measures of executive functioning, verbal learning and memory, and attention. When considering disorder-specific symptoms jointly, symptoms
of PSTD were unrelated to cognitive functioning, whereas symptoms
of depression were negatively correlated with executive functioning
and verbal memory, even when accounting for mTBI-related injury
characteristics and other aspects of cognition that contribute to neuropsychological performance (e.g., premorbid intellectual functioning,
processing speed). Cognitive complaints were correlated with mental
health symptoms but were unrelated to objective cognitive functioning.
Conclusions: Both high levels of general distress and depression-specific symptoms (e.g., anhedonia) appear to play a role in objective and
subjective cognitive functioning in individuals with a history of mTBI
experiencing persistent post-concussive symptoms. Therefore, depression-focused treatment in these individuals will likely lead to improvements in cognitive functioning in conjunction with decreases in mental
health symptoms.

J. DEDERER, K. NAYLON & E.B. LARSON. Self-reported Fatigue
and Cognition in Veterans with History of Concussion and PTSD.
Objective: To identify cognitive correlates of self-reported fatigue in
individuals with a history of concussion and PTSD.
Participants and Methods: Participants (n = 25) previously diagnosed
by structured interview with PTSD and history of concussion, underwent
neuropsychological assessment and completed a self-report measure
of post-concussive symptoms, including fatigue. Measures included:
Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status
(RBANS), Stroop Color-Word Interference Test, Paced Auditory Serial
Addition Task (PASAT), Trails A & B, Wechsler Test of Adult Reading
(WTAR), and the Rivermead Post-Concussive Symptoms Questionnaire
(RPSQ). The construct of fatigue was measured by item 6 on the RPSQ.
Results: A multiple regression analysis indicated that performance
on neuropsychological measures accounted for 78% of the variance
in reported fatigue levels (R2 = .786). Findings indicate that severity
of neuropsychological deficits were strongly associated with increased
levels of self-reported fatigue (F = 4.39, p = .007). Supplemental bivariate correlational analyses showed significant associations with RBANS
immediate memory (r = -.402, p = .046), RBANS delayed memory (r
= -.508, p = .01), PASAT (r = -.413, p = .04), and Stroop (r = -.704,
p < .001).
Conclusions: Van Zomeren et al. (1984) suggest that in people with
TBI, compensation for cognitive impairment depletes resources resulting in fatigue. The present data are consistent with that theory since
severity of cognitive impairment was associated with increased fatigue,
however psychiatric etiologies should also be considered. Increases in
both cognitive deficits and fatigue may be symptomatic of emotional
distress associated with PTSD and post-concussion disorder. This is

296
consistent with previous work by Norrie et al. (2010) which found that,
in individuals with concussion, psychological factors of depression and
anxiety accounted for 59.6% of variance in fatigue severity 6 months
post-injury.

A. SPIROU, G. WYLIE & E. DOBRYAKOVA. Investigating the
relationship between depression and motivation in TBI.
Objective: Individuals with traumatic brain injury (TBI) usually suffer
from neuropsychological symptoms, including depression. Depression
has the potential to not only decrease a patient’s quality of life within
social, functional and occupational realms, but also the positive effects
of rehabilitation. Motivational deficits have been shown to be associated with depression, since these constructs rely on the fronto-striatal
network. In this study, the levels of depression and motivation were
measured in order to see if a relationship exists in TBI.
Participants and Methods: Ten individuals with TBI and 10 healthy
controls (HC) completed the Behavioral Inhibition & Behavioral Activation (BIS/BAS) scale and the Chicago Multiscale Depression Inventory
(CMDI) scale. There were no demographic differences between groups.
Results: A between-subjects t-test between the TBI and HC groups
showed that for the BIS/BAS scale, there were significant differences on
the total output of the BAS (p=.016), specifically with the BAS Drive
subscale (p=.004), which contains items pertaining to the persistent
pursuit of desired goals, and a trend towards significance with the BAS
Reward Responsiveness subscale (.064), which contains items that focus
on positive responses to the anticipation/occurrence of reward. The two
groups were found to be marginally different for the BIS, or punishment sensitivity scale (p=.08). As for the CMDI, significant differences
were found in all three sections of the scale: Mood (p=.008), Evaluative
(p=.036), and Vegetative (p=.006) scales. A strong negative correlation
was found across groups between the two questionnaires.
Conclusions: The TBI group reported higher levels of depressive symptoms and lower levels of motivation compared to HC. Identifying these
important differences between groups may transform clinical and rehabilitative care for the TBI population.

K.J. MANNING & M.T. SCHULTHEIS. Machine Learning
Algorithms and Virtual Reality: Using Technology to Inform Our
Understanding of Cognition and Driving in TBI.
Objective: New technologies, such as Virtual Reality Driving Simulators (VRDS) offer vast amounts of data; however, identifying the
most meaningful variables from these large datasets can be difficult.
Machine-learning algorithms (MLA) can be employed to solve such
data reduction problems. The current study uses MLA to define VRDS
metrics that can best predict whether a driver has previously experienced a TBI.
Participants and Methods: 50 experienced drivers with valid driver’s
licenses (22 TBI, 28 HC) were recruited as part of a larger study. Participants were administered a standardized VRDS task, which included
two simulated driving challenges: construction zone navigation (CZN)
and truck following (TF). Throughout the duration of both tasks, the
VRDS collected data related to many aspects of different driving behaviors (e.g., speed, lane positioning, and stopping behaviors). A recursive
feature elimination support vector machine (an MLA technique) was
used to create predictive value rankings for all driving performance variables during the CZN and TF tasks (35 and 39 variables, respectively).
Additional MLA analyses were used to inform which combination of
CZN and TF variables created the most predictive and parsimonious
models for differentiating TBI from HC drivers.

Results: MLA techniques indicated the most accurate model for differentiating TBI from HC on CZN was comprised of 6 variables (e.g.,
number of collisions, speed variability, time in oncoming traffic lane,
etc.), and yielded an accuracy of 88%. For TF, the most accurate model
was comprised of 5 variables (e.g., max distance from center lane, number of collisions, time in oncoming traffic lane, etc.), and yielded an
accuracy of 74%.
Conclusions: MLA methods offer a data driven approach for examining
novel variables generated by VRDS to differentiate diagnostic groups.
Importantly, these driving performance metrics are not currently available through existing clinical measures and further validate the clinical
contribution of VRDS.

M. EDMUNDSON, P. ARBISI, P. THURAS, M. KRAMER, C. ERBES
& M. POLUSNY. Impact of Mild Traumatic Brain Injury on
Personality.
Objective: Research on personality changes following mild traumatic
brain injury (mTBI) are mixed, with some studies noting personality
changes (e.g., Kurtz et al., 1998) and others finding no change (e.g.,
Rush et al., 2006). As personality disruptions are distressing and interfere with functional outcomes and a significant number of OEF/OIF
veterans sustain mTBIs, it is important to examine mTBI-precipitated
changes to personality in veteran populations.
Participants and Methods: The present study aimed to (1) examine
personality, assessed prospectively (before and after mTBI), using a
dimensional measure that blends clinical and normal perspectives of
personality (MMPI-2-RF PSY-5 scales) and (2) examine changes in
personality when accounting for possible moderating variables, such
as combat exposure, distress, somatic preoccupation, and compensation-seeking. The sample included 241 Minnesota National Guard soldiers with pre- and post-deployment MMPI and mTBI screening data.
Results: Change in PSY-5r scales was significantly predicted by
post-deployment distress (NEGE-r, AGGR-r: p≤.01), post-deployment
somatic preoccupation (NEGE-r, INTR-r, PSYC-r: p<.01), age (INTR-r:
p<.01), and gender (DISC-r, AGGR-r: p<.05). mTBI and involvement in
C&P evaluation did not significantly predict personality change (p>.05)
when accounting for distress and somatic preoccupation.
Conclusions: Findings suggest self-reported personality changes relate
to distress, somatic preoccupation, and demographics rather than being
a direct effect of mTBI.

L. DELANO-WOOD. Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF)
Genotype is Related to Executive Function But Not Memory
Performance in Veterans with History of Mild Traumatic Brain
Injury.
Objective: Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) plays a role in
neurogenesis and synaptic plasticity of hippocampal and forebrain areas; however, its expression is largely influenced by genotype. Compared
with individuals without a BDNF Met allele, research shows Met-allele
carriers have decreased BDNF secretion. However, whether BDNF genotype is related to cognitive outcome, and how any association is modified
by history of traumatic brain injury (TBI) is unclear. We therefore
sought to clarify the relationship between BDNF genotype and cognition
in Veterans with and without a history of mild TBI (mTBI).
Participants and Methods: 117 Veterans (mTBI=72, Military Controls
[MCs]=45]) underwent BDNF genotyping and were divided into (1)
Met+ (n = 34 mTBI; n = 12 MCs), and (2) Met- (n = 41 mTBI; n = 33
MCs) carriers. Participants completed psychiatric symptom inventories and were administered neuropsychological tests that were reflected

Forty Fourth Annual INS Meeting Abstracts
as the following composite scores in analyses: memory (CVLT: Total
Learning, and Short and Long Delay Free Recall) and executive function (DKEFS: Verbal Fluency Switching Total Switching, Trails Number-Letter Sequencing; and WCST Perseverative Responses).
Results: ANCOVA, controlling for psychiatric symptoms, revealed a
significant Group x Genotype interaction for the executive function composite (p = .01). Examination of simple main effects revealed TBI+/
Met- carriers performed significantly worse than TBI+/Met+ carriers,
but no such association was found across genotype in the MC group. No
significant interaction was observed for memory performance.
Conclusions: Results show Met- carriers may be especially vulnerable
to executive dysfunction after neurotrauma. Although this association
is counterintuitive from findings in healthy samples, available evidence
suggests this association differs in TBI samples. Importantly, our results
support this emerging view and future studies are needed to further
explore the epigenetic implications of BDNF on cognitive outcome in
the context of head injury.

between Performance Validity and Perceived Workload in Healthy
Adults and Adults with Traumatic Brain Injury.
Objective: We conducted the current study to determine how scores
on measures of performance validity tests (PVTs) relate to subjective
workload in healthy adults and survivors of moderate-to-severe traumatic brain injury (TBI).
Participants and Methods: A healthy adult group (n= 32) and an
adult TBI group (1+ years post-injury; n=31) completed two PVTs,
the Dot Counting Test (DCT) and the Rey Fifteen Item Test (ReyFIT)
in conjunction with The NASA Task Load Index (NASA-TLX). The
NASA-TLX was administered following each PVT.
Results: As the groups differed in age, univariate analyses of variance
with age as a covariate were utilized to determine group differences.
Pearson product-moment correlations were used to evaluate associations. The threshold for significance was set at p<.05. The groups were
similar in education, estimated premorbid intelligence, mood, and sex.
The groups evidenced valid test performances and performed similarly
on the PVTs.The healthy adult group demonstrated correlations between the DCT E-score and subjective performance demands, while
the TBI group showed no associations between the DCT E-score and
subjective workload ratings. The healthy adult group indicated negative
correlations between the ReyFIT combination score and subjective physical demands, frustration, and overall workload ratings. The TBI group
only showed a negative correlation between the ReyFIT combination
score and subjective frustration.
Conclusions: The current data indicate that healthy adults and adults
with TBI perceive PVTs differently. Additionally, these data suggest
that studies of perceived workload across PVTs may be beneficial for
the detection of malingering in various populations.

M.P. FAYTELL, H.J. HANNAY & P. TAYLOR. Using Disability
Rating Scale Recovery Curves to Predict Performance on the
PASAT After Closed Head Injury.
Objective: To determine whether the rate of recovery of global functioning after closed head injury (CHI) predicts cognitive outcome at six
months post-injury. Specifically, the rate of change of Disability Rating
Scale (DRS) scores over time was hypothesized to be more predictive

297
of cognitive performance on the Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test
(PASAT) than the intercept. Age and severity of injury were expected
to moderate these associations.
Participants and Methods: Archival data of DRS scores and six month
PASAT scores were analyzed from 91 individuals with complicated
mild, moderate and severe CHI. Growth curve analysis was used to fit
and compare individual growth curves to DRS scores taken at acute
care hospital discharge and at one, three, and six months post-injury.
Parameters of the best-fit model were analyzed for their ability to predict cognitive performance at six months post-injury on the PASAT.
Age, Glasgow Coma Scale score, and other demographic and severity of
injury measures were included in the model to determine whether they
moderate the predictive ability of the best-fit model.
Results: Changes in DRS scores over six months post-injury were best
fit by a quadratic growth curve model with random intercept, linear
and curvilinear parameters. Only the intercept (level of DRS score) at
one month post-injury significantly predicted six month PASAT scores,
with higher intercepts associated with lower cognitive performance. Age
significantly modified this relationship, with older participants producing lower PASAT scores.
Conclusions: Contrary to expectations, global functioning on the DRS
at one month post-injury was more predictive of cognitive outcome on
the PASAT at six months post-injury than the rate of recovery. The
extent to which this pattern holds for less demanding neuropsychological
measures remains to be determined.

B. FECHTER, K.A. MUSIELAK & B. ABLITZ. Examining Predictors
of Growth in Traumatic Brain Injury Rehabilitation.
Objective: To examine the influence of biopsychosocial factors on
changes in cognitive skills, psychological adjustment, and life participation following comprehensive rehabilitation after traumatic brain
injury (TBI).
Participants and Methods: Participants included 343 adults ages
18-80 with mild to severe TBI who completed a comprehensive rehabilitation program. Ratings at admission and discharge on an adapted
version of the Mayo-Portland Adaptability Inventory-4 were used to
create change scores, which reflected progress during rehabilitation.
Regression analyses were conducted to examine the influence of age, sex,
socioeconomic status, level of education, previous psychiatric history,
TBI severity, and length of service on overall, cognitive, psychological
adjustment, and life participation change scores.
Results: Level of education significantly influenced scores reflecting
overall change, β = -.194, p < .01. Level of education, β = -.168, p <
.05, and length of stay, β = .148, p < .05, significantly influenced scores
reflecting change in abilities. TBI severity, β = .214, p < .01, significantly
influenced scores reflecting change in psychological adjustment. None of
the aforementioned variables significantly influenced scores reflecting
change in participation.
Conclusions: Level of education attained before injury may be one of
the more important predictors of overall and cognitive rehabilitation
progress post injury, whereas TBI severity may be one of the more
important predictors of rehabilitation progress related to psychological
adjustment. A better understanding of predictors of growth may be
useful for identifying those clients who may be in need of additional
services based on pre-injury functioning.

A.A. FEDIO, S. EFANOV, J.N. STILLMAN, S. CUMMINGS,
V. VILLASEÑOR, K. SHEYS & P. FEDIO. Addressing Anger and
Aggression during Recovery from Traumatic Brain Injury.
Objective: Recovery from traumatic brain injury (TBI) typically involves patients’ feelings of anger as part of the grieving process and

298
may involve aggressive behaviors, particularly when the frontal lobes
are involved. The present study examined how self-ratings of anger and
aggression related to patients’ self-concept, quality of life (QOL), and
motivation for treatment following TBI.
Participants and Methods: Fourteen individuals with moderate-severe
TBI (8M/6F, mean age: 36; 4 years post injury) rated their physical,
cognitive, and emotional status (Neurobehavioral Functioning Inventory [NFI]). They also completed self-ratings of satisfaction with their
recovery, QOL Inventory, Tennessee Self-Concept Scale (TSCS-2), and
Motivation for Rehabilitation Questionnaire.
Results: NFI, TSCS, and overall QOL placed within the average range,
with the exception of individuals’ perceived value as a family member,
which scored below expectations (t(13)=-3.67, p<.005). Patients’ lower
ratings of aggression related to their endorsement of fewer physical
complaints (r=.73), greater satisfaction with cognitive/emotional functioning (r=.75), enhanced QOL regarding pro-social activities (r=.80),
feelings of being a good person (r=.79) and of interacting well with
others (r=.87). Ratings of less anger related to patients’ positive perception of their behavior (r=.70), a willingness to rely on professional help
(r=.81), and interest in rehabilitative treatment (r=.91).
Conclusions: Reducing aggression and maladaptive anger should always be goals following TBI, with present findings suggesting benefits
of enhanced personal functioning and sense of self-worth. Working with
angry thoughts and feelings is a necessary part of treatment, and, in fact,
directly relates to patients’ motivation for rehabilitation. Treatment of
individuals following TBI should explicitly address anger and aggression, with the goals of acknowledging, processing, and accepting losses
and adjusting to a renewed sense of self.

J. FONDA, J. GRADUS, R. MCGLINCHEY, S. BROGLY &
L. FREDMAN. Association between Traumatic Brain Injury and
Opioid Overdose.
Objective: Pain syndromes are highly prevalent in Operation Enduring
Freedom, Operation Iraqi Freedom, and Operation New Dawn (OEF/
OIF/OND) Veterans due to deployment-related incidences causing
musculoskeletal problems and headaches (e.g., blast exposure). Many
are prescribed opioids for pain management. This study evaluated the
association between traumatic brain injury (TBI) and opioid overdose
among OEF/OIF/OND Veterans.
Participants and Methods: The sample included 8,868 OEF/OIF/
OND Veterans (89% male) receiving care at Veterans Affairs (VA)
from 2007 to 2012, aged 18 to 40 at the VA primary TBI screen, and
no history of bipolar disorder or schizophrenia. TBI was defined as a
confirmed diagnosis according to VA TBI comprehensive evaluation
(CTBIE); no TBI was defined as a negative primary TBI screen (i.e. no
head injury). Non-fatal, opioid overdose was defined using ICD-9 codes
recorded in emergency room visits or inpatient hospitalizations. We used
Cox-proportional hazard regression to analyze the contribution of TBI
to the rate of opioid overdose, adjusting for demographic characteristics.
We conducted mediation analyses to determine the direct and indirect
association between TBI and opioid overdose through the psychiatric
conditions of post-traumatic stress disorder, depression, anxiety, and
substance abuse.
Results: There were 79 opioid overdoses recorded: Veterans with TBI
were more likely to overdose than those without TBI (1.3% vs. 0.6%,
respectively). The adjusted Hazards Ratio (aHR) was 2.00, 95% Confidence Interval (CI) =1.26, 3.16. This association was attenuated in
mediation analyses (aHR=1.38, 95% CI=0.94, 2.01). Moreover, 56%
of the effect of TBI on opioid overdose was mediated by co-occurring
psychiatric conditions.
Conclusions: This study suggests that OEF/OIF/OND Veterans with
deployment-related TBIs are at increased risk of opioid overdose, and
is largely attributable to co-morbid psychiatric conditions. Veterans

with co-morbid TBI and psychiatric conditions are at greater risk than
those with TBI alone.

Population Objective, Population Subjective (POPS): Gender
Differences in the Importance of TBI Community ReIntegration
Variables.
Objective: This study examined subjective and objective community
reintegration variables following Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) as part
of a longitudinal study addressing the efficacy of our rehabilitation
program in facilitating community reintegration. This study hypothesized that the importance of reintegration variables differed by gender.
Participants and Methods: 35 Male and 14 Female (N = 49) Moderate
and Severe TBI participants participated in this study.
The Population Objective, Population Objective (POPS; Brown, 2006)
measure was used to collect reintegration data regarding participation
in a wide variety of community-based activities following TBI.
The survey was collected at the time of outpatient registration by the
Neuropsychology Service at a large urban community hospital.
Results: ANOVA analyses were used to compare gender ratings across
community-based activities.
Community reintegration variables rated as clinically significant
post-injury varied by gender.
A one-way ANOVA was used to assess differences between group
means. Community reintegration variables rated as clinically significant
post-injury varied by gender.
Female participation in shopping for groceries F(47,1) = 7.948, p =
.007, cooking F(47,1) = 17.567, p = .000, and cleaning F(47, 1) =
31.964, p = .000 was significantly higher.
Male desire to return to work F(45, 1) = 11.285, p =.002) and importance of work F(45,1)= 5.721, p=.21 was significantly higher.
Women rated private transportation as a significant need F(47,1) =
4.737, p =.035.
Men rated their desire F(47,1) = 6.125, p = .017 and level of importance
F(47,1) = 4.971, p =.031 for public transportation as significant.
Men also reported significantly more engagement in sexual relationships
post-injury F(45, 1) = 8.596, p =.001.
Conclusions: Results indicated that community reintegration variables
were valued differently by gender.
Interdisciplinary interventions in rehabilitation settings need to be assessed and tailored to meet the differing needs of men and women
following TBI.

C.S. GASS, D. ROGERS & E. KINNE. Psychological Characteristics
in Acute Traumatic Brain Injury: An MMPI-2 Study.
Objective: This study used the MMPI-2 to explore detailed psychological features of adults with acute and predominantly mild TBI, including personality, behavioral, emotional, and psychosocial characteristics.
Acute TBI has seldom been studied in such detail, despite empirical
evidence of the relevance of these factors for psychological adjustment
and early therapeutic intervention.
Participants and Methods: Participants were 67 persons who were
hospitalized as a result of predominantly mild acute traumatic brain
injury mostly due to vehicular accidents on the roadway. Participants
were screened from amongst consecutive TBI admissions for pre-injury
neurological, psychiatric, or substance abuse histories. Ages averaged
36.4 years (SD =14.7). Their education averaged 12.8 years (SD = 2.4).
The racial/ethnic composition was White nonhispanic (66%), Black

Forty Fourth Annual INS Meeting Abstracts
nonhispanic (22%), White Hispanic (7%), Other (5%). Most participants had a mild TBI and were tested within three days of admission.
Results: The results revealed diverse psychological problem areas, the
most common of which were (1) somatic and cognitive complaints,
(2) compromised insight and a naively optimistic self-perception, (3)
hypomanic activation, and (4) depression. Men were more likely than
women to report perceptions of social inadequacy and depression, and
antisocial features were associated with lower education. Injury severity
was unrelated to psychological variables.
Conclusions: In the absence of a premorbid history of psychopathology or substance abuse, acute TBI is commonly associated with mild
and relatively benign psychological symptoms, including diminished
self-insight, somatic discomfort, cognitive inefficiency, and a disturbance of mood. These results sharply contrast with non-prospective
MMPI-2 studies of chronic TBI cases in which the psychopathology
is substantially more severe. The mediating influence of demographic
variables on psychological status in acute TBI was generally weak, and
injury severity was unrelated to psychological status.

L.S. GAYNOR, B. ASKEN, J.R. CLUGSTON & R.M. BAUER. Base
Rates of Concussion-like Symptoms in Healthy Collegiate Athletes:
a Predictive Tool for Post-Concussive Recovery Time.
Objective: Sports concussion research supports the importance of baseline testing in collegiate athletes. Subjective symptom reporting scales
reveal variable rates of concussion-related symptoms in this population even at baseline with some athletes appearing to meet concussion
symptom criteria for ICD-10 Post-Concussion Syndrome (PCS) prior
to injury. In athletes meeting symptom criteria for PCS diagnosis at
baseline, we evaluated whether symptom burden was associated with
specific medical history variables and whether it predicted a longer
post-concussion recovery time when a concussion occurred.
Participants and Methods: 542 healthy collegiate athletes (335 male,
207 female, 18.9 ± 0.7 years old) completed either the Post-Concussion Scale or the SCAT3 Symptom Evaluation at baseline, in addition
to medical history questionnaires. Baseline concussion symptoms were
categorized as somatic, cognitive, psychological/emotional, and insomnia/sleep-related. Subsequently, 113 athletes sustained a concussion
and were grouped based on Normal (7 or fewer days) or Prolonged (8
or more days) recovery times.
Results: Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and chi-square
analyses. Overall, 16.2% of athletes met PCS criteria at baseline. Females (25.1%) were 2.5 times more likely than males (10%) to meet
criteria (χ2=19.438, p<.001). Reported history of psychiatric disorder,
ADHD diagnosis, previous history of concussion and migraine were
not associated with PCS symptoms. Athletes who met PCS criteria at
baseline were almost twice as likely to have a prolonged post-concussion
recovery time (χ2=4.142, p=.042).
Conclusions: (1) A clinically significant number of collegiate athletes
meet PCS criteria at baseline. (2) Females are more likely than males to
report these symptoms. (3) Previous or concurrent medical conditions
were not associated with this reported symptom profile. (4) Presence of
concussion-like symptoms at baseline may be a risk factor for prolonged
post-concussion recovery.

Increased Delta Wave Sleep Associated with Central Apnea Events
in Mild Traumatic Brain Injury.
Objective: Central apnea events during sleep are often observed in populations with moderate and severe traumatic brain injury (TBI), but are
not well understood in patients with mild TBI. Increased time spent in

299
delta, or cognitively restoring sleep, may reflect neuronal compensation
for inefficient sleep. The objective of this study was to use a mediational
analysis to determine the frequency at which central apneas occur in a
mild TBI population, and whether their presence was associated with
alterations in sleep staging.
Participants and Methods: Nine OEF/OIF veterans with a history of
varying degrees of Loss of Consciousness (m: 1.44, sd: 2.06) underwent
overnight polysomnography, MR imaging, neuropsychological testing,
and interview.
Results: The predictor variable (LOC) was significantly related to
both the proposed mediator (Central Apneas; R=.84, p = .005) and
the outcome variable (Percent of Delta Sleep; R=.74, p = .023). Additionally, central apneas were significantly related to Percent of Delta
Sleep (R=.85, p = .003). The overall mediation equation was significant;
R=.84, F(1, 7) = 16.54, p = .004 . Central apnea’s relationship with Percent of Delta Sleep was trending on significance even while controlling
for LOC (Beta = .12; t = 2.03, p = .08). Most importantly, the direct
relationship between LOC and Percent Delta Sleep was weaker and insignificant (Beta = .21; t = 0.193, p = .84) compared to the stronger and
significant indirect relationship (Beta = 1.80), suggesting full mediation.
Loss of consciousness remained significantly related to central apneas
even after controlling for age, body mass index, and obstructive events..
Conclusions: Loss of consciousness appears to be associated with
increased central apnea events that lead to a significantly increased
amount of time spent in delta wave sleep. Thus, TBI patients may experience a higher rate of anoxic and apneic events during sleep, which
are compensated for with increased time spent in the restorative stages
of sleep.

Motor Perseveration Predicts Ideational Perseveration on the
Wisconsin Card Sorting Test.
Objective: Perseveration has generally been described as in inappropriate continuation of a behavior that may occur in multiple different
output modalities, thus potentially resulting in differential error types.
Lesions of the basal ganglia, commonly associated with motor perseveration, have been demonstrated to adversely impact executive function.
However, it remains to be seen if there is an association between motor
perseveration and ideational perseveration. Utilizing a qualitative graphomotor test, this study explored the possible impact of motor perseveration on ideational perseveration, as measured by the Wisconsin
Card Sorting Test (WCST).
Participants and Methods: This pilot study utilized data from participants that were drawn from a larger adult archival data source
comprised of neurologically compromised individuals, referred for neurorehabilitation. After excluding conditions such as Parkinson’s disease
and multiple cerebral vascular accidents, the final sample included 21
patients with motor perseveration and 30 patients without. An independent samples t-test was conducted to examine the influence of motor
perseveration on perseverative errors from the WCST.
Results: Groups were similar in gender, lesion acuity, and loci of lesion.
Further, groups did not significantly differ on demographic variables,
such as age and education. Results indicated that patients with motor
perseveration displayed significantly lower perseverative error T-scores
on the WCST, when compared to those individuals who did not display
motor perseveration t(49) = 2.3, p = .02, r = .31.
Conclusions: These results appear to suggest that motor perseveration is significantly associated with higher order cognition. Further, the
two perseverative types may share similar underlying neuroanatomical
mechanisms. Motor perseveration tasks are not always administered in
clinical settings, but may be easily implemented and appear to predict
ideational perseveration.

J. HAMMOND & S. HALL. Bicycle Helmet Use Among CollegeAged Individuals.
Objective: This study examined bicycle helmet use attitudes and behaviors. Traumatic brain injury is a serious public health problem in the
United States, and cycling represents the largest category of sports-related brain injuries. Helmets can significantly lower the risk of brain
injury for cyclists. Yet, the incidence of traumatic brain injury as a result
of a bicycle-related injury remains high. This study examined the rate
of reported helmet use and attitudes towards helmets (the value placed
on Pros and Cons of helmet use) of a high-risk age-group.
Participants and Methods: A survey of bicycle helmet use behaviors
and attitudes was administered to undergraduate students in 2013 and
2015. There were no significant differences in demographics between
the groups in terms of gender and age.
Results: In 2013, 23.1 percent of respondents indicated that they consistently wear a bike helmet, while 27.5 percent indicated the same in
2015. This was not a statistically significant difference (p =.299). In
2013 and 2015, respondents indicated that the most important Pros
of helmet use were (1) Helmets decrease head injuries and (2) Helmets
protect the rider from cars. Furthermore, participants indicated that the
most salient Cons of helmet use were (1) Wearing a helmet is uncomfortable and (2) People tease people who wear helmets.
Conclusions: This research demonstrates consistently low base rates of
bicycle helmet use in the college-aged population. Current intervention
models, without a theory-driven approach, use a mass message to address the complex process of unintentional injury prevention. Instead,
it is important to understand individual forces that impact behavior
change, such as the weighing of the Pros and Cons of a behavior. This
research extends our current understanding of helmet use behaviors
and attitudes, and provides insight into brain injury prevention through
helmet promotion.

C.E. JACKSON, C.B. FORTIER, L. NORDSTROM, W.P. MILBERG
& R. MCGLINCHEY. Post-concussive Symptom Reporting Among
OEF/OIF/OND Veterans: Comparison Between Research and
Clinical Contexts.
Objective: Non-TBI factors may contribute to post-concussive symptom
reporting. In the Veterans Health Administration (VHA), individuals
who screen positive for deployment-related TBI are referred for a Comprehensive TBI Evaluation during which they complete the Neurobehavioral Symptom Inventory (NSI), a 22-item self-report measure of
post-concussive symptoms (PCS). The current study compared NSI total
and subscale scores, as well as an embedded measure of validity, in a
sample of 91 participants enrolled in a longitudinal research study and
also seen for a clinical Comprehensive TBI Evaluation.
Participants and Methods: Participants were Veterans of Operations Enduring Freedom (OEF), Iraqi Freedom (OIF), and New Dawn
(OND) who were enrolled in the Translational Research Center for TBI
and Stress Disorders (TRACTS) at VA Boston. During participation in
TRACTS, Veterans completed the NSI. NSI item-level responses, obtained during the Comprehensive TBI Evaluation, were also extracted
from Veterans’ medical records.
Results: Significant differences in NSI total score (p <.0001) and all
subscale scores (vestibular, somatic/sensory, cognitive, emotional) were
identified (p’s ranged between .001 and <.0001 for all subscales); individuals reported greater symptomatology during their clinical evaluation
compared to their research evaluation, even after adjusting for time
between visits. More than twice the number of individuals failed an
NSI embedded measure of validity (Validity-10; Vanderploeg, 2013)

when it was completed during their clinical evaluation compared to
their research evaluation.
Conclusions: The current findings suggest that OEF/OIF/OND Veterans may over-report PCS in a clinical versus research context. Given
the health and financial implications of diagnosis of TBI among OEF/
OIF/OND Veterans, these results raise concern over the use of a self-report inventory as a measure of PCS during the Comprehensive TBI
Evaluation due to possible over-reporting of symptomatology based on
evaluation context.

J. JONES, T.J. FARRER, S. MERNOFF, M. SPENCER &
M. SULLIVAN. White matter integrity and self-reported sleep
complaints in OEF/OIF/OND Veterans with deployment-related
mild TBI.
Objective: Acute and chronic sleep changes are common in mTBI. The
current study included OEF/OIF veterans with (n=5) and without (n=8)
deployment-related mTBI to examine the relationship between self-reported sleep quality and structural integrity of cerebral white matter
regions (WM) important for sleep regulation.
Participants and Methods: Participants (age 22-35) underwent MRI
with DTI and completed self-report measures of post-concussion symptoms, PTSD, depression, and sleep quality. Region-of-interest (ROI)
analysis, based on the JHU Atlas, included measurement of fractional
anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD) and radial diffusivity (RD) in
regions involved in sleep neurocircuitry, including the right and left
posterior thalamic radiations and pontine crossing fibers. Tractography
analysis involved brainstem segment of the ascending reticular activating system (ARAS).
Results: Veterans with mTBI reported obtaining fewer hours of sleep
and reported more symptoms of PTSD and depression. Compared to
controls, the mTBI group showed increased FA in the pontine crossing
fibers (.05<p<.10), but not the thalamic radiations. Self-reported hours
of sleep significantly and negatively correlated with FA in pontine crossing fibers (r=-0.71, p=.01) for the entire sample and remained significant when controlling for depression (p=.02) and marginally significant
when controlling for PTSD (p=.06). ARAS analysis showed no significant group differences in FA, number of fibers, or mean fiber length.
Conclusions: Decreased self-reported sleep duration was counter-intuitively related to increased FA in the pontine crossing fibers. This finding
may be related to a small sample size. Alternatively increased FA could
represent injury-related decrease in pontine crossing fibers. Investigation of the relationship between WM integrity and sleep duration in a
larger sample of veterans is needed.

Cognitive Components of Verbal Encoding Deficits Following
Traumatic Brain Injury.
Objective: Verbal memory dysfunction following traumatic brain injury
(TBI) is largely due to encoding deficits and these deficits are related
to reduced semantic clustering. Other data has shown that TBI participants have intact, but slowed lexical access. The current study sought to
determine if category fluency and/or switching during category fluency
contribute to encoding deficits for verbal material following TBI.
Participants and Methods: A TBI group (n=24) and a healthy comparison group (n=29) completed a brief interview and a neuropsychological assessment that included the California Verbal Learning Test-II
(CVLT-II), the Category Fluency (CF) and Category Switching (CS)

Forty Fourth Annual INS Meeting Abstracts
subtests of the Delis–Kaplan Executive Function System. Encoding,
consolidation, and retrieval deficit scores were derived from the CVLT-II
via the Item Specific Deficit Approach (ISDA).
Results: Independent samples T-tests were used to evaluate group
difference and hierarchical and stepwise regressions were used to determine associations. The threshold for significance was set at p<.05.
All participants provided valid performances. The comparison group
outperformed the TBI group with regard to common CVLT-II indices.
The comparison group also showed better encoding and consolidation
than the TBI group. Encoding deficits accounted for 53% of the variance
in the delayed recall of the TBI group. Finally, CF accounted for 42% of
the variance and CS accounted for 12% of the variance in TBI-related
encoding deficits.
Conclusions: TBI participants evidenced deficits in verbal encoding
and consolidation. Only ISDA encoding deficit scores predicted delayed
recall following TBI, accounting for 53% of the variance. The encoding
deficits displayed by the participants with TBI were primarily accounted
for by CF (42%) and secondarily by CS (12%). The current results
suggest that verbal memory encoding deficits following TBI are largely
due to slowed lexical access.

Deficits for Verbal Material in Retired Professional Football
Players.
Objective: Previous work has shown that verbal memory dysfunction
is common in retired professional football players with a history of
sports-concussion. The current study sought to determine the memory
process deficits responsible for verbal memory dysfunction in retired
professional football players.
Participants and Methods: A group of retired professional football
(FB) players (most with 3 or more sports-related concussions; n= 23)
and a healthy comparison group (n=29) completed a brief interview,
questionnaires, and a neuropsychological assessment that included the
California Verbal Learning Test-II (CVLT-II). Memory process scores
(encoding, consolidation, and retrieval deficit scores) were derived from
the CVLT-II via the Item Specific Deficit Approach (ISDA).
Results: As the groups slightly differed in age, univariate analyses of
variance with age as a covariate were utilized to determine group differences on scores that were not normed. One-way ANOVAs were used
to evaluate group difference on normed scores that accounted for age.
The threshold for significance was set at p<.05. All participants provided valid performances. The comparison group outperformed the FB
group on the CVLT-II short-delayed free recall score. The comparison
group also showed better retrieval ability than the FB group, suggesting
that the FB groups difficulties on the CVLT-II were driven by retrieval
deficits.
Conclusions: FB participants evidenced difficulties on the CVLT-II
short-delayed recall trial and the retrieval deficit index of the ISDA.
The current results suggest that persons with a history of sports-concussion may exhibit mild verbal memory difficulties that are related to
retrieval deficits.

Sleep Quality vs Quantity: Differential Effects on Cognitive and
Functional Status in Veterans with TBI and PTSD.
Objective: Earlier work has indicated that sleep quality is more related to measures of health and well-being than sleep quantity in young

301
adults. Given the complex relationship between sleep and functional
outcome in returning Veterans, the current study evaluates Sleep Quality
and Sleep Quantity in relation to cognitive and neuropsychiatric symptoms and quality of life in Veterans with TBI and PTSD.
Participants and Methods: Fifty-four OEF/OIF/OND Veterans underwent one week of actigraphy (ACT) and were administered the PTSD
Checklist-Military (PCL-M) and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI)
as well as measures of cognitive and functional status (Dysexecutive
Questionnaire [DEX], Attention Rating and Monitoring Scale [ARMS],
and Quality of Community Integration Questionnaire [QCIQ]). Measures of post-traumatic amnesia (PTA) were collected as an indicator
of blast-induced TBI severity. Sleep Quality measures were PSQI Total
and ACT Sleep Efficiency. Sleep Quantity measures were PSQI Total
Sleep Time and ACT Total Sleep Time. Participants were divided into
PTSD (PCL-M ≥50; n=30) and no-PTSD (PCL-M<50, n=24) groups.
Results: Both patient groups showed a strong correlation between Sleep
Quality (PSQI Total) and QCIQ Cognitive Quality of Life Satisfaction
score, even after controlling for PTA and PTSD symptoms severity.
Additionally, Sleep Quality measures were significantly correlated with
DEX and ARMS in the no-PTSD group only. In contrast, Sleep Quantity
was not related to any of the cognitive or functional status measures
in both groups.
Conclusions: These findings suggest that Sleep Quality is more related
to measures of cognitive and functional status than Sleep Quantity in
returning Veterans with TBI and PTSD. While Sleep Quality was related
to daily cognition measures in Veterans without PTSD, Sleep Quality
appears to be tightly linked with cognitive quality of life measures regardless of PTSD status or blast TBI severity. Evaluation of Sleep Quality is important for treatment planning and outcome in this population.

Auditory Emotion Perception Accuracy in Moderate to Severe
Traumatic Brain Injury.
Objective: Poor emotion perception (EP) following TBI may contribute
to impaired interpersonal functioning and relational distress. EP accuracy among adults with TBI was compared to healthy adults. Neuropsychological correlates of auditory EP were explored to parse out global
versus domain-specific deficiencies following TBI.
Participants and Methods: Participants were 26 individuals with
moderate-to-severe TBI and 19 healthy adults serving as the comparison group (HC). Groups were equivalent in age and education. Participants completed a comprehensive neuropsychological assessment
that included an auditory emotion perception test (EPT). The EPT is
comprised of standardized sentences that lack emotional content but
are read aloud with an emotional tone. Participants are asked to classify
sentences into one of five categories based on the reader’s emotional tone
rather than sentence content.
Results: Independent t tests revealed that the TBI group committed
significantly more EPT errors than did the HC group. Cohen’s d effect
sizes were medium to large for group differences in errors interpreting
Anger, Fear, and Happy expressions, but were small for Sad and Neutral expressions. The most common error in both groups was mistaking
emotion as neutral (i.e., missing emotional content). Among individuals
with TBI, Pearson correlations revealed that EPT errors were related to
poor performance on tasks of attention, executive functioning, and to a
lesser extent, visual perception.
Conclusions: Impaired auditory EP is associated with poor performance on cognitive domains often compromised after TBI. These
preliminary findings suggest a pattern of specific deficits in attention
and executive functioning, rather than one of global decline seen after
TBI. The tendency for individuals with TBI to misperceive anger, fear,
and happy emotions in people’s voices, taken with the tendency for all

302
individuals to misinterpret emotional content as neutral, may contribute
to relational distress and interpersonal conflicts for individuals with TBI.

Is Subjective Disinhibition Associated With Response Inhibition
Performance in Veterans with Mild-Moderate Traumatic Brain
Injury?
Objective: Veterans with history of mild-moderate traumatic brain
injury (mmTBI) frequently endorse greater levels of neurobehavioral
symptoms related to executive dysfunction/disinhibition and negative
mood. However, the relationship between subjective complaints and objective disinhibition/executive function in the context of highly co-morbid psychiatric symptomatology remains unclear.
Participants and Methods: 44 Veterans with post-acute (>8 months)
mmTBI who passed performance validity testing were administered the
Frontal Systems Behavior Scale (FrSBe), a measure of subjective Disinhibition and Executive Dysfunction, the computerized Go/NoGo Task,
a measure of objective response inhibition, and the Beck Depression
Inventory-II and PTSD Checklist, measures of depressive and PTSD
symptomatology.
Results: Correlational analyses revealed that the FrSBe Disinhibition
subscale, but not the Executive Dysfunction subscale, was significantly
associated with inhibition response accuracy (d’) (r = -.339, p = .02)
on the Go/NoGo Task. Higher levels of depression and PTSD were
associated with greater subjective disinhibition (p’s < .001), while only
depression negatively correlated with d’ (p < .01). Hierarchical analysis revealed that depression, but not PTSD, nor subjective complaints,
predicted poorer response inhibition.
Conclusions: In this sample of mmTBI Veterans, greater endorsement
of disinhibition, but not subjective executive dysfunction, was associated
with poorer performance on an objective task of response inhibition.
Subsequent analyses showed that higher levels of self-reported depression best accounted for objective performance over and beyond subjective complaints and PTSD. These results underscore the importance
of assessing the subcomponents of executive dysfunction (specifically
disinhibition) and depressive symptomatology when evaluating the subjective cognitive complaints of mmTBI Veterans. Furthermore, results
provide potential treatment targets for neurobehavioral symptoms related to disinhibition in mmTBI.

A. KLIMOVA, D. PISNER & W.D. KILLGORE. Neural Correlates
of Cognitive and Emotional Impairments in Acute Versus Chronic
Mild Traumatic Brain Injury: a Diffusion Tensor Imaging Study.
Objective: Mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) is a neurological insult,
commonly associated with physical complaints, emotional problems and
cognitive deficits. MTBI has been frequently referred to as an “invisible
injury” as it can be hard to diagnose while potentially having devastating effects on the individual. Recent studies suggest that neural and
psychological profiles of this condition may be time-dependent. In the
present study we examined white matter (WM) integrity of individuals
in the acute versus chronic phases of mTBI.
Participants and Methods: Thirty healthy controls and 26 mTBI participants (14 acute (<3 months post-injury); 12 chronic (>6 months
post-injury to 1 year)). A 3T spin-echo DTI-Echo Planar Imaging sequence was used to acquire diffusion-weighted images (DWIs). Seventy
contiguous, axial, 2.0 mm-thick slices were acquired in 72 directions.
Data were analyzed using Tract-Based Spatial Statistics (TBSS) and
correlated with several behavioral outcome measures.

Results: Both acute and chronic mTBI were associated with reduced
WM integrity as indicated by reduced FA compared to healthy controls
(p<.05; family-wise error (FWE) corrected). There was also a trend
increase in FA in the acute mTBI group compared to the chronic group
in the right superior corona radiata (p <.1; FWE corrected). Across all
mTBI participants, decreased FA was associated with significantly increased sleep impairment, greater post concussive symptoms, decreased
vigilance, greater hostility and lower resilience. In the acute group, decreased FA was associated with increased aggression, whereas there was
no such association in the chronic group.
Conclusions: Results indicate that both acute and chronic mTBI are
characterized by compromised WM coherence with a trend towards
decreased WM integrity among patients with chronic versus acute mTBI.
These WM reductions are associated with increased cognitive and emotional problems, particularly among those in the chronic stage.

Using DTI to Narrow the Diagnosis of TBI in Cases of Global
Cognitive Disorder.
Objective: Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is a powerful imaging technique used to assess the microstructure of cerebral white matter (WM).
Fractional anisotropy (FA) is a common measure in DTI, which indicates the directionality of diffusion processes in WM. Lower FA values
are correlated to axonal injury and demyelination. This case study will
examine the use of DTI to narrow the diagnosis of mild TBI in a case
of global cognitive disorder.
Participants and Methods: The patient L.Y. is a 42-year-old female
who was struck in the head by falling ceramic tiles and rendered unconscious for 5-10 minutes. After the accident she complained of persistent
headache, dizziness, impaired concentration and memory, irritability,
loss of motivation, and distressing memories of the accident. She underwent a neuropsychological evaluation two months after the accident
and was diagnosed with post-concussion syndrome and global cognitive
disorder. The presentation of global cognitive disorder suggested the
patient had sustained injury to multiple brain regions. A DTI study was
ordered to assess the location of TBI.
Results: DTI revealed multiple chronic white matter hyperintensities
within the subcortical white matter of both hemispheres of the frontal
lobe, correlated with areas of decreased FA. These findings suggest
extensive axonal injury to the frontal lobe.
Conclusions: In this case the patient presented with global cognitive
disorder, which typically involves damage to multiple regions of the
cortex. However, DTI revealed that damage was localized to bifrontal
regions of the brain and excluded involvement of the temporal and
parietal lobes. Frontal lobe injury is the most common form of mild
TBI and also produces the most diverse array of clinical presentations
(Kolb & Wishaw, 1990). Damage to to both hemispheres of the frontal
lobe can lead to a particularly broad range of impairments (Bonnier et
al. 2010). This case demonstrates that DTI can be used to narrow and
enhance the diagnosis of mild TBI in cases of global cognitive disorder.

Following Sport-Related Concussion: A Longitudinal Diffusion
Tensor and Diffusion Kurtosis Imaging Study.
Objective: Previous studies indicate that following sport-related concussion (SRC) the brain undergoes anatomical and physiological changes
that may linger past the point of clinical recovery, and white matter
(WM) tracts are especially vulnerable to this type of injury. Advanced
neuroimaging techniques like diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and diffusion kurtosis imaging (DKI) are pivotal to understanding WM changes

Forty Fourth Annual INS Meeting Abstracts
following SRC. Most studies, however, have not captured concussed
athletes immediately after injury, perhaps missing valuable information
about acute neuropathological processes.
Participants and Methods: In this study, 26 high school and college
football players (mean age = 17.6; SD = 1.5) underwent MRI imaging
and assessment of symptoms, balance, and cognition within 24 hours
of SRC and one week later (8 days post injury). 26 matched control
athletes (mean age = 18.0; SD = 1.5) completed identical protocols. DTI
and DKI were analyzed using Tract-Based Spatial Statistics.
Results: At 24 hours post injury, the SRC group reported significantly
more concussion symptoms than the Control group and performed worse
on a cognitive screening measure. There were no group differences on
these measures at 8 days post injury. On DTI, the SRC group demonstrated a widespread decrease in mean diffusivity, and to a lesser extent
decreases in axial and radial diffusivities, compared to control subjects
at 24 hours post injury. These DTI changes became more widespread
at 8 days post injury. On DKI, the SRC group had increased axial kurtosis at 24 hours post injury relative to controls that also became more
widespread after 8 days.
Conclusions: These findings suggest that, while acute clinical symptoms of SRC returned to baseline over one week following injury, areas of restricted diffusion and increased axon complexity were evident
beyond the point of clinical recovery, likely due to axon swelling and
beading. The current study has implications for determination of recovery following SRC and return-to-play management.

Association of Activity Memory Components and Memory Process
Deficits Following Traumatic Brain Injury.
Objective: Persons with traumatic brain injury (TBI) demonstrate difficulty recalling completed activities, but show intact source and temporal
order memory (TOM) for activities. Encoding deficits might be responsible for TBI-related problems with activity recall. We conducted the
current study to determine how activity memory is related to memory
process deficits following TBI.
Participants and Methods: A TBI group (n=23) and a comparison
group (n=28) were administered a battery of neuropsychological tests
that served as to-be-remembered activities. Participants rated their subjective workload after each test. Participants’ recall, recognition, and
TOM for each test were assessed. Memory process scores were derived
from the California Verbal Learning Test-II via the Item Specific Deficit
Approach (ISDA).
Results: Univariate analyses of variance with age as a covariate were
utilized to determine group differences. Regressions were computed to
evaluate associations between activity memory and memory processes.
The comparison group demonstrated greater recall of activities in contrast to the TBI group. The groups did not differ in TOM or recognition
for the activities. Encoding deficits, accounting for 42% of the variance,
emerged as the sole predictor of activity recall in the TBI group. Retrieval deficits, accounting for 26% of the variance, emerged as the sole
predictor of TOM for activities in the TBI group.
Conclusions: The TBI group demonstrated poorer activity recall than
the comparison group, but the groups were equivalent in TOM and
recognition for activities. Activity recall in the TBI group was predicted
by encoding deficits. TOM for activities in the TBI group was related
to retrieval deficits.

Does Psychoeducation Promote Recovery for Patients with
Persistent Concussion Symptoms?
Objective: Benefits of psychoeducation immediately following concussion have been reported (Ponsford, 2012). Further, we found that group
psychoeducation intervention significantly reduced symptom severity
and increased concussion knowledge in individuals within the early
stage of recovery (Matsuzawa et al., 2015). In the current study, we
examined whether individuals beyond 6 months post-injury benefited
from group treatment. Outcomes for participants within the period of
most rapid recovery (3-6 months; Mittenberg, 1993) vs. at later stages
of recovery were compared.
Participants and Methods: Eleven participants within 6 months and
16 participants beyond 6 months of sustaining a single concussion participated in an 8-week psychoeducation group at an urban outpatient
rehabilitation center. Study design involved a case series with pre- and
post-testing across four group cohorts. Data collection utilized questionnaires assessing concussion knowledge, the types/severity of symptoms, affective functioning, perception of concussion impact, and life
satisfaction.
Results: Paired t-test analyses indicated decrease in symptom severity,
p<.05, and impact on daily life, p<.05, among participants 6 months
post-injury. In addition, moderate effect size of increased concussion
knowledge (d=.66), moderate-to-large effect size of reduced belief of
symptom duration (d=.76), and large effect size of reduction in concerns about their concussion (d=1.03) were found. These findings are
consistent with our results for patients in early stage recovery (Matsuzawa et al., 2015). Independent sample t test showed no significant
differences in improvements between participants within vs. beyond 6
months post-injury.
Conclusions: Providing psychoeducation in a group format is beneficial
for individuals beyond the initial rapid recovery phase. No distinctions
were found between those receiving psychoeducation in the early vs.
later stage of recovery. This type of treatment may facilitate recovery
for concussion patients with persistent symptoms.

BEAUMONT. Emotion Recognition in Concussed Athletes.
Objective: The majority of studies have focused on the cognitive symptoms associated with concussion. Recently, studies have identified an
increased risk of depression and anxiety after concussion, and this risk
is accentuated in females. Patients with anxiety and/or depression symptoms were shown to be particularly tuned to recognize emotional elements in their environment. The purpose of this study was to investigate
sex differences in emotion recognition in collegiate concussed athletes.
Participants and Methods: A total of 22 concussed athletes (11 males;
11 females) and 22 unconcussed athletes (11 males; 11 females) were
tested. Participants completed the Post-Concussion Symptom Scale
(PCSS), the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II) and the Beck Anxiety
Inventory (BAI). They also completed a morphed emotion recognition
task. Pictures of a male face expressing basic emotions (anger, disgust,
fear, happiness, sadness, surprise) morphed with another emotion were
randomly presented. After each face presentation, participants were
asked to indicate the emotion expressed by the face. Emotion recognition accuracy (proportion of trials in which the emotion was recognized
when it was dominant in the morph stimulus) and threshold (emotional
intensity needed to detect an emotion on 50% of the trials in which it
was presented) were computed.
Results: A significant Group X Sex interaction was found across all four
negative emotions. Descriptive statistics showed an increase in threshold
with a concomitant decrease in accuracy in concussed male athletes,
while concussed female athletes exhibited the reverse results pattern.

304
Conclusions: These results indicate that relative to unconcussed counterparts of the same sex, concussed males needed greater emotional
intensity in order to correctly recognize a negative emotion, while concussed females required less intensity. These findings identify emotion
recognition as a potential contributor to the reported increased risk of
anxiety and depression in female concussed athletes.

N. MADIGAN, A. STILLMAN, N. SWAN & M. ALEXANDER. Factors
Contributing to Executive Functioning Symptoms in mTBI.
Objective: Though concussion is very common, and most patients recover, a subset (~10%) experience lingering symptoms that seem disproportional to the injury. Identification and management of factors
that contribute to persistence should improve outcome. The purpose of
the current study was identification of factors contributing to cognitive
symptoms in a civilian cohort.
Participants and Methods: 87 consecutive clinical referrals (age:
M=39.8, SD=12.7, 31M/56F, days post injury: M=72.3, SD=37.2) to a
hospital-based outpatient specialty clinic were screened to exclude more
severe injury; concussion severity was stratified by AAN 1997 criteria.
Prior psychiatric history was noted. Participants reported significant
concussive symptoms (Rivermead M=28.9, SD=12.3). Measures: Subjective cognitive dysfunction (BRIEF-A self-report); Focused cognitive/
psychological assessment (Trails B, CVLT-2, ROCF, CPT-2; BDI-2,
BAI, PCL-C).
Results: BRIEF-A General Executive Composite (M=57.8 SD=12.1)
and its two Indices were overall in the nonclinical range, though 38.2%
of patients had clinically significant scores (T>65). Cognitive measures:
Mean normative scores were in the average range. Psychological measures: All scores were elevated (BDI-2, M=15.2, SD=8.8; BAI M=12.2,
SD=10.1; PCL-C, M=36.5, 15.8).
1) There were no significant correlations of BRIEF-A scores with concussion severity or any subject demographic variable (except for education
[r=-.25] for one Index); 2) Trails B was the sole cognitive correlate with
BRIEF-A scores (r = -.25 to -.29); 3) All self-report mood measures
correlated with BRIEF-A scores (r = .45 to .81); 4) In stepwise multiple
regression analysis, only mood measures were a significant predictor
of subjective executive symptoms; depression (BDI-2) was the critical
contributor (β=.74, p <.001).
Conclusions: In this civilian cohort, subjective executive symptoms
after concussion appear to be due to psychological distress more than
to demonstrable executive deficits or to subtle clinical differences in
injury severity.

L. MANDERINO & J. GUNSTAD. Athletes with ADHD or History
of Academic Difficulties Show Intact Performance on Baseline
ImPACT Testing.
Objective: ADHD and other academically-relevant diagnoses have been
identified as modifiers of cognitive testing in sport-related concussion,
such as ImPACT. As a result, these conditions may produce a test profile
suggestive of suspected low effort. The present study examines group
differences on the ImPACT in student-athletes with preexisting ADHD
or academic difficulties compared to those without.
Participants and Methods: Three consecutive seasons of baseline ImPACT protocols from 173 NCAA Division I football players (average
age=19.2y; 21.1% ADHD diagnosis; 16.2% academic difficulties) were
analyzed. Only the first collegiate, baseline protocol from each player
was examined.
Results: Neither student-athletes with ADHD (Pillai’s Trace=.01,
F(5)=.37, p=.87) nor those with history of academic difficulties (Pillai’s
Trace=.01, F(5)=.30, p=.91) performed worse on ImPACT composite

scores than those without. Similarly, student-athletes with ADHD diagnosis (χ2(1)=.12, p=.55) and with history of academic difficulties
(χ2(1)=.00, p=.66) were no more likely to produce invalid baseline
protocols than those without these histories.
Conclusions: These findings suggest that student-athletes reporting
ADHD diagnosis or history of academic difficulties do not show worse
performances on ImPACT composite scores or validity protocols than
those without such difficulties. However, many traditional neuropsychological tests do show poorer performances for adults with ADHD
and failure to find these group differences raises the possibility that the
ImPACT may not detect all poor effort performances. Future studies
should examine ImPACT’s low effort score thresholds to confirm their
sensitivity and specificity. Relatively little is known about the validity
indices of the ImPACT and convergent validity with traditional validity
tests should be investigated both pre- and post-injury.

J. LINCK. Effect of Modifications in ICD-10 Criteria on Diagnostic
Rates for Post-Concussive Syndrome.
Objective: Post-concussive syndrome (PCS) includes cognitive, affective, and physical symptoms after a TBI. Diagnostic rates of PCS based
on ICD-10 criteria are known to be high relative to other classification
systems due in part to no requirement for evidence of objective impairment. This study aims to examine the effect of modifications of ICD10 criteria (i.e. objective evidence of cognitive impairment and valid
reporting/performance) on diagnostic rates.
Participants and Methods: 257 consecutively-referred Veterans (242
males; mean age=32.2) who screened positive for TBI were seen for
neuropsychological testing. 67 Veterans were ultimately not considered to have had a TBI. PCS was diagnosed based on ICD-10 criteria
with items from the Neurobehavioral Symptom Inventory. Objective
cognitive impairment were scores 1 standard deviation or more below
the mean on either CVLT-II delayed recall or WAIS-IV Digit Span.
Symptom and performance validity were examined with MMPI-2 FBS
and Word Memory Test. Descriptive statistics were used to demonstrate
the effect of modifying the ICD-10 criteria.
Results: Using standard ICD-10 criteria, 233 of 257 Veterans met criteria, including 60 of 67 without TBI. Adding the additional requirement
of objective cognitive impairment, 103 of 257 met criteria, including 27
of 67 without TBI. When diagnostic rates were re-examined using only
valid data based on objective indicators of performance and symptom
validity, 84 of the original 257 Veterans remained in the sample. 68
of 84 met ICD-10 criteria including 15 of 22 without TBI. When the
requirement of objective impairment was added, 9 of 84 met criteria,
including 5 of 22 without TBI.
Conclusions: The study showed large differences in diagnostic rates
of PCS in those with and without TBI with modifications of evidence
of impairment and valid data. Future research validating ICD-10 PCS
criteria should consider how slight modifications might enhance the relation of this diagnosis to objective indicators of community functioning.

Objective: Mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) is an ongoing concern

often have comorbid psychiatric conditions which can result in cognitive complaints and most individuals with a prior mTBI return to

validity tests (PVT) (i.e. motivation, engagement, and/or malingering)
has found that individuals with a reported mTBI are more likely to
perform below expectations on PVTs. The purpose of the current study
was to examine rates of psychological diagnoses in a mTBI sample and
possible variability in memory scores given their performance on PVTs.
Hypotheses were that Veterans reporting mTBI would be more likely
to perform below expectations on PVTs, a majority would not receive
diagnosis for a cognitive disorder, and that there would be a significant
difference in delayed memory between those who passed PVTs vs. those
who performed below expectations.
Participants and Methods: 62 Veterans completed neuropsychological
testing at a VA hospital between 2013-2015 and reported a history of
at least one mTBI.
Results: 48% performed below established cutoffs on PVTs. 15% met
diagnosis for a neurocognitive disorder, while 74% did not, but met
diagnosis for a psychological disorder, and the remaining 11% met
diagnoses for neither. There was no statistically significant difference
between Wechsler Memory Scale IV (WMS-IV) Logical Memory scores
for individuals who passed PVTs vs. those who performed below expectations (t = .35).
Conclusions: Implications regarding these findings will be discussed.

M. MELLINGER, T. HUDSON & C.V. FLAHERTY. Assessment and
Remediation of Adult Abulia Following Severe Traumatic Brain
Injury in Infancy.
Objective: Abulia is a lack of motivation associated with one’s ability
to perform activities of daily living (ADL’s) (Hastak, Goraward, & Misha, 2005). We assessed neurocognitive status and applied behavioral
treatment strategies in a 23-year-old abulic male who had sustained a
severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) during infancy, with consequent
damage to his bilateral pre-frontal, limbic and occipital brain regions.
Our goal was to improve verbal output, which had regressed following
discontinuation of formal schooling.
Participants and Methods: Cognition was assessed by administration
of the NEPSY-II, with interpretation of findings based upon normative
standards for 10 years of age. We then applied ‘smart space’ technologies to monitor verbal output throughout the process of applying an
approach to enhance motivation to communicate.
Results: Preserved capacities included functional abilities for visuomotor precision (5th percentile), design copy for local features (50th
percentile), non-verbal category fluency (16th percentile), and spatial
judgment (vectors) (9th percentile). Preserved language and memory
capacities included auditory comprehension (5th percentile), sentence
repetition (37th percentile), verbal memory for paragraph material
(25th percentile), and delayed memory for faces (9th percentile). He was
able to correctly recognize ‘Angry’ (51-75th percentile) and ‘Disgusted’
(51-75th percentile) expressions, suggesting relative preservation of personal survival oriented - but not interpersonal oriented - emotional facial
expression processing. Over a period of 12 weeks, with verbal output
measured as words and sentences, we found a statistically significant
degree of improvement in initiation of spontaneous speech at the word
(P=.000) and sentence (P=.000) level as well as improvements in prosody of speech.
Conclusions: Our evidence based approach has application to adults
with abulia consequent to both pediatric and adult TBI, intractable to
conventional pharmacological approaches in the chronic course.

Exploratory Analysis of the Reintegration to Normal Living Index
in a Stroke Population.
Objective: Stroke is a common and often debilitating health-care
problem which frequently leads to decrements in overall functioning
capacity. The reintegration to normal living index (RNLI) is a global
assessment of patient quality of life often utilized in stroke populations.
Despite its common use, psychometric validation studies of the RNLI
have not been sufficiently validated in stroke populations. This study
is believed to represent the first factor analysis of the RNLI using an
exclusively stroke sample. Given the lack of previously published data
regarding this population, the current investigation represents an exploratory analysis of the RNLI. Previous studies in different general
disability samples have consistently reported a two-factor solution with
the RNLI.
Participants and Methods: We retrospectively examined RNLI scores
of 928 adults with strokes of varying severities as part of a multidisciplinary, interinstitutional collaboration across an academic medical
center, acute care hospital, and rehabilitation center. We utilized both
a principal components factor analysis and parallel analysis to evaluate
the factor structure of the RNLI.
Results: Mean RNLI scores ± SD for the sample was 75.26 ± 19.85,
ranging between 20 and 100. The Cronbach α was .94. A scree test for
factor retention strongly suggested a single factor solution, explaining
64.50% of the total variance. Follow-up Horn’s parallel analysis also
suggested a single factor solution.
Conclusions: Previous factor analyses on the RNLI utilizing general
disability samples commonly report a two-factor solution. Our data
supports the presence of a single factor solution across the RNLI within
a significant stroke population. This suggests that the RNLI acts as more
of a unitary measure of quality of life within a stroke sample relative
to other disabled samples. Future research should cross-validate the
reported factor structure in stroke samples using confirmatory analyses.

J.B. MIELKE & K. HIGHLAND. Correlation of the ToPF and the
WAIS-IV IQ scores in a High Functioning, Active Duty, Military
Population.
Objective: As part of the diagnostic evaluation at the National Intrepid
Center of Excellence (NICoE), active duty service members (SMs) with
a history of mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) and psychological
health issues complete a neuropsychological assessment. The ACS Test
of Premorbid Function (ToPF) can be used to predict patient performance on cognitive measures. If the ToPF is not highly correlated with
the SMs actual intellectual abilities, subtle relative deficits in cognitive
functioning may be missed without full IQ testing. This study looks at
the relationships between the SMs ToPF score, current Wechsler Adult
Intelligence Scale-IV (WAIS-IV) scores, and symptoms of anxiety.
Participants and Methods: SMs (N=52) with a history of TBI completed the WAIS-IV, ToPF, and Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI). Correlations tested relationships between WAIS-IV full-scale (FSIQ), subscales
[verbal comprehension (VC), working memory (WM), perceptual reasoning (PR), processing speed (PS)], and ToPF scores. Cluster analyses
identified two groups based on subscale scores, average (AP) (n=24,
Mean FSIQ=105, SD=7) and superior (SP) (n=27, Mean FSIQ=121,
SD=6) performing. Within-group linear regressions examined the relationship between FSIQ and ToPF, controlling for BAI scores.
Results: Overall, ToPF was positively correlated with VC and WM, but
not PR or PS. ToPF was positively correlated with FSIQ in the AP group,
not the SP group. ToPF was associated with FSIQ when controlling for
BAI in the AP group, but not in the SP group.
Conclusions: The ToPF may be cautiously used as a proxy for estimating premorbid cognitive abilities in SMs with average IQ in SM
presenting with mTBI, even when accounting for self-reported anxiety.
The ToPF does not appear to be a good indicator of IQ for higher-performing SMs with TBI. Administration of the WAIS-IV FSIQ could help

306
reveal relative deficits that may exist in the high-performing SMs that
may be missed when relying on the ToPF alone.

D. MILLER, J.P. HAYES, G. LAFLECHE, D.H. SALAT &
M. VERFAELLIE. White Matter Abnormalities in Blast-Related
mTBI are Associated With an Overall Index of Cognitive
Impairment.
Objective: Blast-related mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) is a common injury of the Iraq and Afghanistan Wars. Research has suggested
that blast-related mTBI is associated with chronic white matter abnormalities, and that these TBI-related abnormalities are associated with
impairment in neurocognitive function. However, findings are inconsistent as to which domains of cognition are affected by TBI-related white
matter abnormalities. Recent evidence that white matter abnormalities
associated with blast-related mTBI are spatially variable raises the possibility that the associated cognitive impairment is also heterogeneous.
Thus, the goals of this study were to examine (1) whether the extent of
mTBI-related white matter abnormalities is associated with an overall
index of cognitive impairment that takes into account heterogeneity
across individuals, and (2) whether white matter abnormalities provide
a mechanism by which mTBI influences cognitive function.
Participants and Methods: Ninety-six OEF/OIF veterans who reported blast exposure within 100 meters were assigned to one of three
groups: a no-TBI group, a mTBI without loss of consciousness (LOC)
group (mTBI-LOC), and a mTBI with LOC group (mTBI+LOC). Participants were given a battery of neuropsychological tests that focused on
the domains of attention, executive function, verbal and visual memory,
and motor function.
Results: Results showed that the number of white matter abnormalities
was associated with the odds of having impairment in one or more cognitive domains, even after accounting for posttraumatic stress disorder
(PTSD) symptom severity. A mediation analysis revealed that mTBI+LOC was indirectly associated with cognitive impairment through
its effect on white matter integrity.
Conclusions: These results suggest that cognitive difficulties in blast-related mTBI can be linked to injury-induced neural changes when taking
into account the variability of injury as well as the heterogeneity in
cognitive deficits across individuals.

Cognitive Reserve and Postconcussive Symptoms Reported by
Blast Exposed Operation Enduring Freedom/Operation Iraqi
Freedom (OEF/OIF) Veterans.
Objective: Examine the influence of cognitive reserve on self-reported
postconcussive symptoms in a sample of OEF/OIF Veterans with blast
exposure.
Participants and Methods: Participants were 92 previously deployed
OEF/OIF Veterans at the Portland VA grouped according to blast exposure history (no history of exposure and history of blast exposure).
Cognitive reserve level was based on education and performance on the
RIST and WTAR. Cognitive reserve proxy variables were converted to
a composite z-score. We compared raw scores on the British Columbia
Postconcussion Symptom Inventory (BC-PSI) for each group. We conducted a two-stage hierarchical multiple regression comparing total
raw BC-PSI scores for Veterans based on blast exposure and cognitive
reserve.
Results: Significant results were found for group membership and estimated cognitive reserve for predicted postconcussive symptoms with
history of blast exposure and lower cognitive reserve level associated
with higher BC-PSI scores. History of blast exposure accounted for 31%

of the variation in total raw BC-PSI scores. Addition of cognitive reserve
to the regression analysis explained an additional 3.5% of variation in
reported symptoms indicating a small effect.
Conclusions: Higher levels of cognitive reserve may serve as a protective factor against developing postconcussive symptoms in Veterans
with a history of blast exposure. Given this result, health care providers
may be better equipped to identify and provide treatment for Veterans
at greater risk for developing postconcussive symptoms following blast
exposure.

with Better Neurocognitive Functioning Among Veterans with
Mild Traumatic Brain Injury.
Objective: Mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) is common among
military personnel, and there is mounting evidence that a history of
mTBI elevate risk for poor long-term cognitive outcomes. We therefore
examined whether engagement in physical, mental, and social activity
was related to better neurocognition (NC) among a well-characterized
cohort of Veterans with a history of mTBI.
Participants and Methods: 41 mTBI Veterans (mean age=33, 88%
male) underwent a comprehensive assessment of neurobehavioral and
cognitive functioning. Participants were excluded if they failed symptom
validity tests. A global NC score was derived using demographically-adjusted scores from the following domains: executive functioning,
learning and memory, attention and processing speed, and language.
Participants were classified based on the number of self-reported Active
Lifestyle Factors (ALFs; Mental, Physical, and Social), and relationships
to global NC and specific cognitive domains were explored.
Results: Participating in more ALFs was associated with better global
NC (F=3.7; p=0.02), executive functioning (F=3.0, p=0.04), and attention and processing speed (F=2.9, p=0.05). Post hoc analyses revealed
engagement in all 3 ALFs was related to the highest global NC. The
relationships with ALFs and global NC (F=3.3, p=0.03) and executive
functioning (F=2.8, p=0.05) remained significant after adjusting for
depressed mood and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
Conclusions: In our sample of Veterans with mTBI, findings suggest
that an active lifestyle is associated with better global cognition. This
relationship was most pronounced for executive dysfunction. Specifically, results show that greater activity engagement in everyday life is
associated with enhanced objective cognitive performance, even after
adjusting for levels of depressive symptomatology and PTSD in patients
with history of head trauma. Findings have implications for the refinement of intervention strategies to optimize clinical outcome in Veterans
in the aftermath of head injury.

K. NAYLON, J. DEDERER & E.B. LARSON. Impact of Cognitive
Fatigue on Reported Post-Concussive Complaints.
Objective: To investigate the variability in reported post-concussive
symptoms as explained by direct neuropsychological assessment of cognitive fatigue controlling for premorbid intelligence and for acquired
cognitive impairment.
Participants and Methods: Participants (n = 17) previously diagnosed
with concussion underwent neuropsychological assessment, including:
Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status
(RBANS), Wechsler Test of Adult Reading (WTAR), Paced Auditory Serial Addition Task (PASAT), and Rivermead Post-Concussive
Symptoms Questionnaire (RPQ). Post-concussive symptom severity
was measured the RPQ-3 (an RPQ factor subscale). Cognitive fatigue

Forty Fourth Annual INS Meeting Abstracts
was measured by PASAT fatigue—a direct measurement of decline in
accuracy between the first and last 7 items of a PASAT trial.
Results: Hierarchical regression analysis demonstrated that after entering the WTAR and the RBANS Total Index, adding PASAT fatigue
improved the proportion of explained variance from 38% to 67% (R2
Δ .288, F Change (1,13) 11.204, p = .005).
Conclusions: Previous work on the relationship between post concussive symptoms and cognitive functioning found a weak but significant
relationship (Dean & Sterr, 2013). The importance of controlling for
premorbid factors in post-concussive syndrome has been previously
identified (Bigler, 2008).The current study found a neuropsychological
measure of cognitive fatigue has additional unique power to explain
post-concussive symptoms, without relying on self-report measures.

Traumatic Brain Injury and Aggregate Comorbidities on Cognitive
Functioning in a Marginally Housed Sample.
Objective: Individuals living in marginal urban housing face numerous
mental and physical health risks that impair cognition. From a cognitive
reserve framework, this results in less capability to deal with further
brain insult. This study examines the effect of self-reported traumatic
brain injury (TBI) on cognition in persons with differential levels of
neurocognitive burden.
Participants and Methods: Two hundred and ninety-three participants (age: 37-51; 225 M, 68 F), recruited from single-room occupancy
hotels (government-owned low-income housing) underwent neurocognitive testing from which a composite cognitive score was derived on the
basis of tests of attention, inhibition, and verbal learning and memory.
Additionally, a statistically weighted neurocognitive-burden index was
created that reflected the aggregate extent to which non-TBI comorbidities (vascular health, mental health, substance use, viral infection,
neurological illness) and demographics (age, education, premorbid IQ)
were associated with cognition. This index was investigated for its moderating influence on the relationship between self-reported TBI history
(loss of consciousness of 30 minutes or more) and neurocognition.
Results: Hierarchical linear regression was used to predict cognition.
Independent variables included the burden index (Block 1), history of
TBI (Block 2), and their interaction (Block 3). As expected, the burden
index accounted for 26% of the total variance in cognition (F(1, 176)
= 61.94, p < .000). No further variance in cognition was accounted for
by TBI or the neurocognitive burden by TBI interaction.
Conclusions: In this complex multimorbid sample, neurocognitive
burden was a strong associate of composite cognitive functioning. In
contrast, TBI was not associated with cognition regardless of level of
burden. These findings indicate that self-reported TBI history has minimal value in signifying cognitive dysfunction in multimorbid marginally
housed individuals.

Stay, Rate of Functional Improvement, and Functional Abilities
at Discharge Following Stroke.
Objective: Functional and cognitive abilities at admission to hospital
following stroke are important predictors of recovery outcomes. This
study examined the ability of the Functional Independence Measure
(FIM) and neuropsychological (NP) tests to predict (1) length of stay in

307
hospital (LOS), (2) rate of functional improvement, and (3) functional
abilities at discharge.
Participants and Methods: Participants (N=51) were hospital inpatients admitted to a rehabilitation unit following stroke. The FIM was
used to assess functional abilities (both motor and cognitive) at admission and discharge from hospital. NP tests were used to assess cognition across multiple domains (e.g., memory, visuospatial, and executive
function). Three separate hierarchical multiple linear regression model
were examined using the FIM and NP tests as independent variables to
predict rate of functional improvement, LOS, and functional abilities
at discharge.
Results: Age and the FIM motor subscale (FIMm) significantly predicted LOS, F(3,31)=27.551, p<.001, R2=.78. The FIM cognitive subscale (FIMc) and NP tests did not significantly add to the model. Age,
education, admission FIM scores, and NP tests were not significant
predictors of rate of functional improvement. FIMm and FIMc at admission explained 59.6% of the variance in FIM discharge scores. Adding
in NP testing results only slightly improved the model, explaining a
total of 70.5% of the variance in FIM discharge scores, F(4,30)=13.52,
p<.001, R2=.70. Only the NP tests assessing memory added significantly
to the model.
Conclusions: The FIM is an important clinical tool for assessing functional abilities following stroke. The FIM at admission was a significant
predictor of LOS and of functional abilities at discharge. NP test results
were not predictive of LOS in hospital, rate of improvement, or functional abilities at discharge. Results suggest that motor abilities are more
important predictors of LOS and future functional abilities in stroke
patients than NP tests.

K.L. OSBORNE-CROWLEY, S. MCDONALD & J.A. RUSHBY. Can
Reversal Learning Deficits Explain Social Disinhibition Following
Severe Traumatic Brain Injury?
Objective: Acquired social disinhibition after a severe traumatic brain
injury (TBI) is a distressing behavioural syndrome for the individual,
their family and the community. It has been postulated that reversal
learning deficits, or the inability to update behaviour when reinforcement contingencies change, may underlie socially disinhibited behaviour. The current study aimed to determine whether these reversal
learning impairments were associated with social disinhibition in a TBI
sample.
Participants and Methods: Twenty-one participants with TBI (19
males, mean age 46.9 years) and 21 control participants (18 males,
mean age 45.29 years) completed both a social and non-social reversal
learning task. Number of errors and the feedback-related negativity
(FRN), an event-related potential component of the electroencephalogram which reflects reward prediction error signals, were examined.
Participants were also rated on their level of social disinhibition by two
independent, blind raters based on a videotaped interview.
Results: The TBI group made more reversal errors, F(1,40)=9.54,
p=.004, η2=.19, and produced smaller amplitude FRN’s, F(1,39)=8.97,
p=.005, η2=.19, than did controls across both the social and non-social
versions of the reversal learning task. Further, those TBI subjects high on
social disinhibition made more reversal errors than did TBI subjects low
on disinhibition on the social task, F(1,21)=9.23, p=.007, η2=.34. On
the other hand, FRN amplitude was not related to social disinhibition.
Conclusions: These results suggest that impairment in the ability to
update behaviour when social reinforcement contingencies change plays
a role in social disinhibition after TBI. However, that FRN amplitude
was not associated with disinhibited behaviour suggests that reward
prediction error signals are not necessarily a signal used for flexibly
updating behaviour when social reinforcement contingencies change.

K.L. OSBORNE-CROWLEY & S. MCDONALD. Hyposmia, But Not
Emotion Perception Impairment, Predicts Psychosocial Outcome
after Severe Traumatic Brain Injury.
Objective: Behavioural changes have often been reported to be among
the most distressing outcomes of TBI for the individual and their close
others. Social disinhibition is a particularly debilitating behavioural
syndrome which is thought to result from injury to the orbitofrontal
region of the brain. The current study aimed to determine whether
two variables associated with orbitofrontal damage, emotion perception
deficits and hyposmia (olfactory impairment), can predict social disinhibition and psychosocial outcome after traumatic brain injury (TBI).
Participants and Methods: An emotion labelling task, an emotion
intensity rating task, the Brief Smell Identification Test (BSIT), and an
observational measure of social disinhibition were completed by 23 individuals with severe TBI. The disinhibition domain of the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI-D) and the interpersonal relationships subscale of the
Sydney Psychosocial Reintegration Scale (SPRS-IR) were completed by
a close other. Fifteen control participants provided norms against which
to assess performance on the emotion intensity rating task.
Results: Hyposmic participants with TBI were rated as having experienced more change to interpersonal relationships on the SPRS-IR than
those without a smell deficit. Hyposmia, though, was unable to predict
informant-reported or observed social disinhibition. An impairment in
accuracy scores on both emotion perceptions tasks was found for participants with TBI, yet intensity ratings did not differ between groups.
Finally, emotion perception was not related to disinhibition or change
in interpersonal relationships.
Conclusions: These findings support previous claims that olfactory
deficit has prognostic significance following TBI. However, although
hyposmia was predictive of interpersonal difficulties, the relationship
does not appear to be driven by an association with social disinhibition.
Emotion perception impairment measured by standardised tasks does
not appear to be an important factor in psychosocial outcome after TBI.

Executive Control and Memory Acquisition in Traumatic Brain
Injury.
Objective: Deficits in memory acquisition are among the most debilitating cognitive symptoms following traumatic brain injury (TBI). The
current study investigated whether individuals with TBI demonstrate
memory impairment due to executive control difficulties in prioritizing
the acquisition of relevant instead of irrelevant information.
Participants and Methods: TBI and healthy adult (HC) participants
completed neuropsychological tests and an experimental task-switching/
memory paradigm (TSM). In the TSM paradigm, participants simultaneously viewed word and picture stimuli and were cued to attend to
and classify either the word or the picture. Then, acquisition of relevant
(cued) and irrelevant (not cued) stimuli was assessed with a recognition
test.
Results: On the recognition test, TBI participants showed significantly
greater difficulty prioritizing words instead of pictures when cued to
attend to words. Thus, TBI participants produced significantly lower
recognition ratings for relevant words compared with HCs. Although
TBI and HC participants did not differ significantly in number of
words recalled on the California Verbal Learning Test-Second Edition (CVLT-II), TBI participants demonstrated significantly greater
false positive responses and lower discriminability performance on the

CVLT-II recogniton test. Further, in the sample of TBI participants,
those producing false positive responses on the CVLT-II demonstrated
significantly greater difficulty in prioritizing words instead of pictures
on the TSM recognition test compared with TBI participants who did
not produce false positive responses on the CVLT-II.
Conclusions: Results suggest that the ability to encode verbal information post-TBI may be related to difficulties inhibiting irrelevant stimuli, especially when relevant and irrelevant information is presented
simultaneously.

in OEF/OIF/OND Veterans with Mild Traumatic Brain Injury.
Objective: Literature suggests that 15-20% of Veterans deployed
during Operation Enduring Freedom, Operation Iraqi Freedom, and
Operation New Dawn (OEF/OIF/OND) have sustained at least one
blast-related mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI). Although perceived
attentional difficulties are common in this population, most of these
complaints have not been objectively verified. The purpose of this study
was to examine different types of attention and working memory in this
population using standardized neuropsychological measures.
Participants and Methods: 75 OEF/OIF/OND Veterans participated
in the study; 23 deployed controls (no mTBI) and 52 with a history
of blast-related mTBI. Neuropsychological measures included the Ruff
2&7 Selective Attention Test, Auditory Consonant Trigrams (ACT), and
Test of Everyday Attention (TEA). Self-reported cognitive difficulties
were assessed with the Frontal Systems Behavior Scale (FrSBe).
Results: Compared to controls, Veterans with a history of mTBI performed significantly worse on measures of active working memory (ACT
18 second delay, p=.007), selective attention (Ruff automatic detection
accuracy p=.042), and divided attention (TEA dual task time per target,
p=.019; weighted time per target, p=.015; and dual task decrement
scaled score, p=.048). Veterans with mTBI also reported significantly
more cognitive complaints on the FrSBe (total score, p=.002).
Conclusions: Consistent with research examining non-blast mTBI populations, results from this study indicate that OEF/OIF/OND Veterans
with a history of mTBI exhibit significantly more attentional difficulties and subjective cognitive difficulties compared to Veterans without
mTBI. Future research should explore the relationship between discrete
attentional weaknesses and other cognitive domains, such as memory
and learning.

D. PISNER, P. SINGH, A. FRIDMAN & W.D. KILLGORE. Resilience
Following Mild Traumatic Brain Injury is associated with Gray
Matter Volume in the Left Precentral Gyrus.
Objective: The ability to rebound from disruptive life challenges, often
referred to as “cognitive resilience,” is known to contribute to more successful outcomes following mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI). Since
the neurobiological profile of resilient individuals following mTBI has
yet to be established, the present study investigated the relationship
between resilience and gray matter volume (GMV) in individuals who
have recently incurred an mTBI.
Participants and Methods: Twenty-six right-handed mTBI participants (11 males, mean age = 23.4) underwent high resolution T1
structural neuroimaging and completed the Connor-Davidson Resilience
Scale (CD-RISC), a Likert-type self-report assessment of personality
traits that enable one to thrive in the face of adversity. Controlling for
time since injury, intra-cranial volume, age, and gender, a voxel-based
morphometric (VBM) multiple regression analysis was used to explore
the association between GMV in the frontal lobe and CD-RISC scores.

Forty Fourth Annual INS Meeting Abstracts
Results: Utilizing a small volume correction (SVC) for the frontal lobe,
CD-RISC scores were found to be positively correlated with greater GMV
in the left precentral gyrus (13 voxels, p<.05, FWE corrected). Exploratory analysis further revealed that this association is significantly more
prominent in the acute (less than 3 months), as opposed to the chronic
stage (between 3 and 12 months) following an mTBI.
Conclusions: The present findings suggest that GMV in the left precentral gyrus may predict cognitive resilience following an mTBI. Although
the precentral gyrus is primarily thought to be responsible for voluntary
movement, studies have shown that the left precentral gyrus may be
associated with subthreshold depression risk and negative self-attributional bias in response to adverse life events. Early identification of
gray matter deficits in this region following mTBI may therefore alert
clinicians to the need to devote greater attention towards cultivating
cognitive resilient skills.

Variability on Neuropsychological Measures in OEF/OIF/OND
Veterans: Associations with Blast-related mTBI and PTSD.
Objective: Approximately 15-20% of US Service Members deployed
during Iraq and Afghanistan conflicts have sustained a mild traumatic
brain injury (mTBI). Many service members report persistent cognitive difficulties, yet objective evidence of cognitive weaknesses remains
equivocal. This study examined intra-individual variability (IIV) on
neuropsychological tests as an alternative method for detecting subtle
cognitive difficulties in this population.
Participants and Methods: Participants included 55 male OEF/OIF/
OND Veterans: 17 without TBI or PTSD, 10 with mTBI but no PTSD,
and 28 with comorbid mTBI/PTSD. Self-reports included the FrSBe
and PCL-M. Neuropsychological tests included the ACT, Ruff 2&7,
WAIS-III Letter-Number Sequencing, CVLT-II, and BVMT-R. An IIV
score (standard deviation of test scores around person-means) was
calculated for each participant. Group differences were examined via
one-way ANOVAs.
Results: A significant group effect emerged for IIV scores (p=.02) but
not average T scores (p=.13) on neuropsychological tests, as well as
for self-reported cognitive difficulties and PTSD symptoms (ps <.001).
Post-hoc analyses revealed that Veterans with comorbid mTBI/PTSD
exhibited significantly higher IIV and greater perceived cognitive difficulties compared to the other groups. Across groups, IIV scores were
positively associated with FrSBe (p=.03) and PCL-M (p=.01) scores;
after controlling for PTSD, the relationship between IIV score and FrSBe
score was no longer significant (p=.56).
Conclusions: In this study, neuropsychological test variability corresponded to cognitive complaints. Veterans with comorbid mTBI/PTSD
demonstrated the most objective and subjective cognitive weaknesses,
suggesting an additive effect of PTSD. Future research should examine
whether neuropsychological IIV is uniquely associated with PTSD and
whether IIV reflects lasting pathophysiological effects of mTBI observed
via modern imaging techniques (i.e., diffusion tensor imaging).

M.E. ROBINSON, L.J. RADIGAN, L.J. GRANDE, W.P. MILBERG &
R. MCGLINCHEY. Close-Range Blast Exposure is Associated with
Greater Clinical Burden.
Objective: Previous work has demonstrated that close-range blast exposures (CBE), while not necessarily producing concussion symptoms
at the time of the event, are associated with demonstrable changes in
brain function. The effects of these exposures are further explored to
understand their role in the various co-occurring maladies that characterize this cohort.

309
Participants and Methods: Participants were Veterans and pre-deployed service members from the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan who
were enrolled in the TRACTS VA Center of Excellence where clinical
measures were assessed. Associations with CBE were assessed while controlling for age, gender, education, and Deployment Risk and Resiliency
Inventory – Other score.
Results: CBE was associated with more severe pain (p = 0.003), sleep
impairment (p = 0.013), anxiety (p = 0.038), depression (p = 0.044),
stress (p = 0.008), and neurobehavioral symptom inventory score (p =
0.031). There were trend-level effects on posttraumatic stress disorder
symptom severity (p = 0.054). There was no significant difference in
total WHODAS score, although some subscores significantly differed.
Participants with CBE also were more likely to report tinnitus (p =
0.015) hearing impairment (p = 0.021), but were no more likely to
report headaches, migraines, dizziness, or fainting (p>0.05).
Conclusions: Although the methods used in this study can only assess
correlation and not causation, it appears that CBE is associated with
greater clinical burden in Veterans than would be expected from their
deployment history alone. Given the alarming number of soldiers that
are exposed to these blasts, a greater understanding of the effects of
exposure, even without associated concussion, is necessary to provide
the most effective treatment.

S.L. WARREN, M. MELINDER & N. ROTHONG. Neuropsychological
Associations of Mild Traumatic Brain Injury and Psychopathology.
Objective: Military personnel involved in the current conflicts are
sustaining mild TBI (mTBI; i.e., concussion) at unprecedented rates.
While many individuals who sustain mTBI do not experience ongoing
symptoms, research suggests that some individuals experience persistent
cognitive sequelae and/or mental health problems. There is considerable controversy as to whether the etiology of enduring cognitive
disruptions can be attributed to mTBI, or if these neuropsychological
consequences are better explained by the presence of anxiety and/or
depressive symptoms. Accordingly, this study examined the contribution
of remote mTBI, anxiety, and depression to cognitive disruptions in a
Polytrauma/TBI Veteran population.
Participants and Methods: A retrospective chart review was conducted
of Veterans seen in the Polytrauma/TBI Clinic of the VA St. Louis
Health Care System from 12/1/2006 through 1/6/2015. Participants
included 267 Veterans who participated in the clinical interview and
neuropsychological evaluation. Hierarchical linear regressions were
conducted to investigate the relationships between mTBI, anxiety, and
depression across a comprehensive battery of neuropsychological tests.
Results: Mental health symptoms mediated the relationship between
mTBI and neuropsychological performance.
Conclusions: Clinicians are confronted with many challenges in the
care of Veterans with co-occurring mild TBI, PTSD, and depression, as
differential diagnosis is complicated by common symptoms among these
phenomena. Elucidating the source(s) of enduring cognitive disruptions
in mTBI has implications for the development and implementation of
effective treatment interventions, such as psychoeducation about typical
mTBI recovery and the impact of mental health symptoms on everyday
cognitive functioning.

V. SAMARINA, T.L. MERKLEY, E.A. WILDE, S. MCCAULEY,
A. BARNES, G. HANTEN & H.S. LEVIN. Cognitive, Somatic, and
Emotional Changes in Patients with Mild Traumatic Brain Injury
(mTBI) and Orthopedic Injuries at Baseline and 3 Months PostInjury.
Objective: Postconcussive symptoms are non-specific as they can
be seen across various clinical populations and can be impacted by
numerous factors including emotional distress, premorbid cognitive
difficulties, or litigation involvement. Some studies indicate that most
mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) patients appear to experience a full
recovery by 3 months, while others suggest that sequelae may persist
longer following injury. The present longitudinal study investigated
potential cognitive, somatic, and emotional changes in adolescents and
young adults of comparable demographic background at 96 hours and 3
months post-injury following either an orthopedic injury (OI) or mTBI.
Participants and Methods: The groups were comparable for age and
other demographic factors. Individuals with either a history of mTBI
(N=53) or orthopedic injuries (N=38) were administered tests of visual
and verbal memory and phonemic verbal fluency.
Results: Cognitive performance did not differ between the mTBI and
OI groups at either 96 hours or 3 months. On self-rating questionnaires,
compared to the OI group the mTBI patients endorsed more symptoms
on the Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist Scale (PCLS) at 96 hours
(p=0.001) and at 3 months (p<0.001). More symptoms were also endorsed on the Rivermead Post Concussion Symptoms Questionnaire
at both time points (p’s<0.001). More specifically, the mTBI group
reported more cognitive and somatic problems both at 96 hours and 3
months (all p’s <0.001), although their reported cognitive symptoms did
not correspond with their observed performance on memory and verbal
fluency tasks. There was a trend for endorsement of more emotional
symptoms in the mTBI group at 96 hours (p=0.054), and this discrepancy became more apparent at 3 months (p=0.003) in comparison to
the OI group.
Conclusions: The current findings suggest that mTBI patients may
demonstrate a good cognitive recovery in these domains, although
patients may continue to endorse cognitive, emotional, and somatic
sequelae.

M. SANDERSON-CIMINO, S.M. JURICK, L.D. CROCKER,
A. KELLER, A. RAUCH, C. JOHNSON & A.J. JAK. Use of the TOMM
Response Consistency Indices in Veterans with History of Mild
Traumatic Brain Injury and PTSD.
Objective: The Test of Memory Malingering (TOMM) is used to assess
neuropsychological performance validity. The Alabama Consistency
Index (ACI) and the Invalid Forgetting Frequency Index (IFFI) were
developed to increase TOMM sensitivity rates by measuring response
consistency across trials of the TOMM. The IFFI distinguishes valid
learning patterns from inconsistent responding, whereas the ACI does
not. We sought to compare the cognitive performance of those who displayed differing patterns of ACI and IFFI performance and to determine
if those with subtle learning impairments on the TOMM demonstrate
difficulty on other measures of learning and memory.
Participants and Methods: 30 OEF/OIF Veterans with a history of
mild to moderate traumatic brain injury and post-traumatic stress disorder underwent a comprehensive neuropsychological battery and were
separated into 3 groups based on ACI and IFFI performance. The ‘pass’
group (n=10) scored above cutoffs on both the ACI and IFFI, the ‘fail’
group (n=10) scored below cutoffs on both measures, and the valid
learning patterns group (‘valid learning’ group, n=10) scored below
cutoff on the ACI but above cutoff on the IFFI.
Results: ANOVAs demonstrated that the fail group performed significantly poorer than the pass group on all neuropsychological measures. In
contrast, the valid learning group performed similarly to the pass group
across all cognitive domains (p’s > .05) except for memory, where the

valid learning group performed significantly worse than the pass group
on learning and recall measures of the California Verbal Learning Test
II (CVLT-II) and comparably to the fail group.
Conclusions: The response consistency indices of the TOMM show
differential patterns in Veterans with a history of TBI and PTSD; those
performing below cutoff on the ACI but above on the IFFI show neuropsychological patterns more similar to those scoring above cutoff on
both indices. However, memory performance was most similar between
the fail and valid groups.

P. SINGH, A. FRIDMAN, D. PISNER & W.D. KILLGORE. Time
Dependent Differences in Gray Matter Volume in Individuals Post
Mild Traumatic Brain Injury: A Voxel Based Morphometric Study.
Objective: Mild Traumatic brain injury (mTBI) is known to cause diffuse axonal injury, but may also affect gray matter (GM) structures in
the brain. This damage is dependent on multiple factors such as site of
injury and time since injury (TSI), which can vary clinical manifestations of mTBI. Due to their location, the occipital and temporal lobes
have shown to be prone to the effects of mTBI. Damage to these regions
may lead to disturbances in the visual pathways and object and facial
recognition
Participants and Methods: Twenty-six right-handed mTBI individuals participated in the study. Two groups were formed on the basis
of TSI: 13 acute (≤92 days) and 13 chronic (>92days). Voxel-based
morphometry (VBM8) was used to analyze T1 high-resolution structural
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. Segmented GM images were
analyzed to determine regions in which acute and chronic groups had
significant differences in volume
Results: After controlling for age, gender and intra-cranial volume,
the acute group had significantly (p<0.05, FDR corrected) less GM
volume in the right fusiform gyrus and right inferior temporal gyrus as
compared to the chronic group. The fusiform gyrus region was found to
be significantly correlated (R2 = 0.172) with the psychomotor vigilance
task (PVT) average reaction time performance as compare to chronic
group (R2 =0.044)
Conclusions: Significant differences were found in GM volumes in the
acute and chronic groups particularly in the regions involving ventral
visual processing. This finding shows that some of the visual processes
in the acute phase of mTBI might be compromised more as compared
to chronic phase. Early intervention post mTBI might be helpful at
this stage. Future studies will need to examine other effects of mTBI in
acute and chronic stages, which can help in developing better targeted
intervention strategies.

M. SULLAN, B. ASKEN, A.R. SNYDER, E.C. CREW, J.R. CLUGSTON
& R.M. BAUER. The relationship between post-concussive sleep
symptoms and recovery time in Division 1 collegiate athletes.
Objective: Changes in sleep patterns are frequently reported following brain injury and have been associated with a greater likelihood of
developing neuropsychiatric problems, such as depression and PTSD,
complicating recovery. This study sought to determine the relationship
between sleep-related symptoms and recovery time following sports
related concussion.
Participants and Methods: The University of Florida Concussion Databank (UFCD) contains retrospective and prospective concussion-related data for consenting UF varsity athletes. Records from 74 concussed
athletes (4 female, 70 male, 20.3 ± 1.3 years) were analyzed. Symptoms
were assessed using the Post-Concussion Scale (PCS) and were clustered
into four categories: somatic, cognitive, sleep, and psychological. Days

Forty Fourth Annual INS Meeting Abstracts
Missed was calculated as the number of days between day of injury and
clearance for return to contact.
Results: Using Pearson correlations, only total sleep symptom severity
and somatic symptom severity were significantly related to Days Missed
(r=.309, p=.007; r=.244, p=.037 respectively). In a single hierarchical
regression model controlling for gender and history of concussion, sleep
and somatic symptoms were no longer significant predictors of recovery
time. However, sleep symptom severity (β=.234) was a better unique
predictor of Days Missed than was somatic (β=.117), cognitive (β=.026) or psychological symptom severity (β=.060).
Conclusions: Changes in sleep patterns following concussion are significantly associated with greater recovery time following injury. These
data provide the impetus for a larger-scale study with an increased
sample size and more heterogeneous population to determine the mechanisms by which post-concussive sleep changes impact recovery time.

D.F. TATE, C.S. VELEZ, A. DRENNON, M. REID, J. KENNEDY,
A. BOWLES & D. COOPER. Subjective Reports of Cognitive
Dysfunction and Objective Neuropsychological Test Results
Among Active Duty Service Members.
Objective: Subjective cognitive complaints and neuropsychological
findings do not always agree in type and severity leading to a number
of important clinical questions and concerns. The purpose of this study
was to characterize the relationship between subjective reporting of
cognitive symptoms and objective neuropsychological test results in a
cohort of active duty service members.
Participants and Methods: 176 service members (121 mild TBI/55
orthopedically injured (OI) controls) participating in this research study.
Each participant was administered the Neurobehavioral Symptom Inventory (NSI) and a battery of neuropsychological tests (NPT, 9 test/15
scores). Each participant’s response to the 4 cognitive items from the
NSI (NSI-Cog) were used as a subjective measure of cognitive dysfunction. Partial correlations between the NSI-Cog scores and 15 NPT
scores (while controlling for age/sex) were examined for the entire group
(mTBI and OI combined) and separately.
Results: Combined, results demonstrated significant moderate relationships between NSI-Cog response scores and all but two NPT scores
(after multiple comparisons correction; r absolute value range=0.229
to 0.449). The number of relationships was reduced to 5 significant
NPT test scores (CVLT-II total, short delayed, long delayed, WAIS-IV
processing speed index, and Trails A time; r absolute value range=0.264
to 0.315) when examining the mTBI group only. One NPT test score
(CVLT-II total score; r-value=-0.469) was found to be related to NSICog score in the OI group. The direction of the correlations was consistently in the expected direction with elevated NSI-Cog scores indicating
poorer NPT performance.
Conclusions: Results suggest that as a group (with the full range of
NSI-Cog variability), military research subjects showed an association
between subjective complaints and objective test performance, though it
is clear that additional analyses are needed to clarify the contribution of
additional individual variables of interest (i.e., mood, pain, PTSD, etc).

D.P. TERRY & L. MILLER. Microstructural White Matter Changes
in Non-Professional Football Players 20-45 Years After Two or
More Concussions.
Objective: The long-term effects of concussions are still being elucidated
at the microstructural level. Previous diffusion tensor imaging (DTI)
studies have shown white matter changes in former professional athletes
who experienced concussions. However, research has neglected individuals at the non-elite level. This study examined middle-aged former

311
high school football players who experienced multiple concussions with
the expectation that those with concussive histories would have lower
fractional anisotropy (FA) and higher mean diffusivity (MD) than the
non-concussed controls.
Participants and Methods: Forty right-handed males ages 40-65 were
recruited from the community. All participants played high school football but did not play in college or professionally. Participants either
received two or more concussions in the context of high school football
(n=20; average 3.4 concussions) or no lifetime concussions (n=20). DTI
scans with 30 optimized gradient directions were collected. Data were
processed using whole-brain Tract-Based Spatial Statistics and compared across groups using 5000 null permutations and a threshold-free
cluster enhancement based p-value of .05.
Results: The two groups were matched on age, years of education,
estimated IQ, and current concussion-like symptoms. The previously
concussed group exhibited lower FA (p < .05) than the control group
in parts of the right genu/body of the corpus callosum, bilateral internal
capsule, bilateral superior longitudinal fasciculus, and bilateral inferior
frontal longitudinal fasciculus. However, there were no statistically significant differences in MD between groups.
Conclusions: These data are consistent with studies that show lower
FA in professional athletes with concussive histories, which suggests
microstructural changes are chronic and evident in the absence of a
lifetime of contact sports exposure. Future studies should use more
specific DTI indices to help elucidate the specific microstructural white
matter changes, as FA is a non-specific measure.

E. VAKIL, O. AVIV, M. MISHAEL & Y. SACHER. Title: Direct and
indirect measures of context in patients with moderate-to-severe
Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI): The additive contribution of eye
tracking.
Objective: The facilitation of memory for target stimuli due to similarity
of context in the learning and testing phases is known as the “Context
Effect” (CE). The paradigm used enabled measuring memory for target,
direct memory for context and indirect memory for context as expressed
in CE. Previous studies reported that while memory for contextual information in patients with TBI was impaired when measured directly
CE was preserved. In an attempt to obtain a better understanding of the
underling cognitive processes while performing this task, eye movements
were monitored for participants in both groups.
Participants and Methods: Twenty five patients with moderate to
severe TBI (mean age 28.58) and 25 matched controls (mean age 27.84)
participated in this study. We employed a local-context stimulus array,
presenting participants with photographs of trial-unique male faces
shown wearing distinctive, trial-unique hats (yielding specificity).
Throughout the test, eye movements were recorded by the SensoMotoric
Instruments (SMI) RED-M remote eye-tracker that allowed free head
movements, with a sampling rate of 120 Hz and high accuracy of 0.8°.
Results: Behavioral results were consistent with previous results which
showed that memory in patients with TBI was impaired when measured
directly but preserved when measured indirectly (i.e. CE). For both
groups, eye tracking showed longer dwell-time on targets during the
learning phase for the stimuli correctly answered. At the test phase,
dwell-time on targets was longer for the control group than for the
TBI group.
Conclusions: The finding that eye movement patterns were similar
for the two groups during learning but different during the test phase
indicates that the source of the differences in memory performance
between the groups is at the retrieval rather than the encoding stage of
learning. This study demonstrates the potential benefits of eye tracking
to enhance understanding of underling cognitive processes.

Predicting Return to Work at Six-Month Follow-up in Mild to
Moderate Stroke Patients: The Relative Importance of Physical
Disability and Neurocognitive Functioning.
Objective: Stroke is the second most common neurological disorder
in adults next to Alzheimer’s disease. Although cerebrovascular events
are often associated with high mortality rates, improvements in acute
interventions have led to increased survival rates, accentuating the importance of understanding residual deficits. A number of metrics are
used to quantify everyday functioning following stroke, one of which is
assessing return to work (RTW). We hypothesized that acute neurocognitive data would predict RTW above and beyond select demographic
and physical therapy (PT) metrics.
Participants and Methods: We retrospectively examined the medical charts of 120 adults with mild to moderate strokes (defined as an
NIH Stroke scale score of < 17) as part of a multidisciplinary, interinstitutional collaboration across an academic medical center, an acute
care hospital, and a rehabilitation center. We sought to predict stroke
patients’ self-reported RTW status at a six-month follow-up phone interview from demographic and acute PT and neurocognitive data using
a hierarchical logistic regression model.
Results: Findings indicated that 75% (90/120) patients who were
working previously were able to RTW six months following their strokes.
Moreover, adding neurocognitive data improved predictive power above
and beyond age, stroke severity and PT measures and our final regression model accurately identified 83% (100/120) of these individuals’
RTW status. Beta coefficients suggested that expressive language (the
Boston Naming Test) had the greatest degree of predictive power among
the neurocognitive measures in the analysis.
Conclusions: Our data argue for the clinical utility in examining acute
neurocognitive performances, especially expressive language, when
predicting a patient’s ability to RTW following a stroke. Together with
physical disability data, this will allow clinicians to better tailor therapies to individual patients, thereby increasing efficiency in the utilization
of healthcare resources and improving overall patient outcome.

C.S. VELEZ, M. REID, A. DRENNON, J. KENNEDY, D. COOPER,
A. BOWLES & D.F. TATE. Base Rates Neuropsychological
Performance in Service Members with Mild TBI, PTSD and
Orthopedic Controls.
Objective: Service members in the United States military returning form
Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF)
and Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF) missions are presenting with
multiple symptoms stemming from various injuries including mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) and post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
One of the biggest challenges is establishing the clinical and cognitive
profiles that can discriminate between disorders such that finding the
appropriate treatment becomes more likely. The purpose of this study is
to characterize the cognitive function and symptom reporting in a cohort
of 182 active duty service members returning from OEF/OIF missions.
Participants and Methods: The sample is comprised of four groups
including Orthopedic controls (OI)=44, PTSD only=19, TBI only=31,
and TBI with PTSD=88. Neuropsychological test scores and symptom
reporting inventories were compared using a multivariate general linear
statistical procedure controlling for age and gender.
Results: Results demonstrated significant differences (Hotelling’s Trace
F-Value=11.054, p<.001) with a dose effect relative to OI controls.
The PTSD group showed significant differences in working memory
and symptom reporting (p value<.04) . The TBI group showed further

significant differences in processing speed and fluency (p value<.04),
and TBI+PTSD group showed significant differences across the spectrum of neuropsychological tests and symptom reporting.
Conclusions: These findings support the burden of adversity hypothesis that posits that the combination of mTBI/PTSD puts individuals
at increased risk for worse outcomes. Characterizing the unique patterns of cognitive dysfunction across these groups is not only useful in
discriminating between diagnostic groups, but planning/implementing
prospective treatment programs capable of addressing the unique needs
of these patients. Further analyses that include additional clinical and
demographic variables (i.e., mood, pain, sleep, etc.) are needed to confirm and extend these findings.

K.C. VYNORIUS, A. PAQUIN & D.R. SEICHEPINE. Lifetime
Multiple Mild Traumatic Brain Injuries are Associated with
Cognitive and Mood Symptoms in Young Healthy College Students.
Objective: Mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) has been associated with
a range of acute and long-term cognitive and emotional difficulties. To
date, no studies have examined the impact of a lifetime accumulation
of mTBIs on cognition and mood in a sample of young adults who were
not elite athletes or military personnel. The present study examined the
impact of multiple mTBIs acquired over a lifetime on executive functioning and symptoms of depression in young healthy college students.
Participants and Methods: Twenty-nine undergraduate students
without an mTBI history (female=25) and twenty-nine with 2 or more
mTBIs (female=23) participated in this study. Participants completed
several standardized measures of mood, behavior, and cognition, including the Cognitive Complaint Index (CCI), Behavior Rating Inventory of
Executive Function, adult version (BRIEF-A), and the Beck Depression
Inventory, second edition (BDI-II). A definition of mTBI consistent with
the American Academy of Neurology’s current guideline was used.
Results: Participants with an mTBI history compared to those without,
endorsed significantly more cognitive complaints on the CCI (p<.01),
more problems with executive functioning on the BRIEF-A overall score
(p<.05), and more symptoms of depression on the BDI-II (p<.05).
In individuals with mTBIs, the number of injuries significantly correlated with scores on the CCI (rho=.64, p<.01), BRIEF-A overall score
(rho=.47, p<.01), and the BDI-II (rho=.53, p<.01).
Conclusions: Consistent with the literature in elite athletes and military
personnel, mTBIs acquired over a lifetime were associated with cognitive
and executive functioning complaints and symptoms of depression in
young healthy college students. These mTBIs were acquired through
a wide variety of activities, such as horseback riding, ice hockey, basketball and using vehicles. These findings suggest that multiple mTBIs
acquired over a lifetime may be associated with subtle cognitive and
emotional weaknesses even in otherwise young healthy college students.

A. HIRALALL & S. SCHAFFER. Total Sedation and Delirium are
Related to Memory Functioning, but Not General Cognition, in
Critically Ill ICU Patients at Time of Discharge.
Objective: Delirium is common in the ICU, affecting 50-90% of patients. Previous research has demonstrated that delirium in the ICU is
associated with long-term cognitive impairment, but the nature of the
relationship between ICU delirium and cognitive dysfunction is not well
understood. The goal of the current study was to determine whether
total days of delirium predicted cognitive status at ICU discharge. The
association between sedation, a risk factor for delirium, and cognitive
status was also examined.

Forty Fourth Annual INS Meeting Abstracts
Participants and Methods: 34 individuals without pre-existing neurological or cognitive impairment who were admitted to the ICU for greater
than 72 hours and diagnosed with septic shock and/or respiratory failure
were enrolled. Richmond Agitation Sedation Scale (RASS) score and
delirium (i.e., orientation and attention) were assessed approximately
four times daily. At the time of ICU discharge, memory (RBANS List
Learning) and general cognitive functioning (MMSE) were assessed.
Results: After covarying for length of stay, age, and total hypoxia (serum oxygenation), cumulative level of sedation during the ICU stay
predicted poorer memory functioning (β = -1.04, p < .01, R 2 Δ = .17)
at ICU discharge. Total days of delirium was also predictive of poorer
memory, but to a lesser degree (β = -.34, p < .10, R 2 Δ = .09). Of the
covariates, length of ICU stay (β = -1.24, p < .01) emerged as an independent predictor of poorer memory functioning at discharge. However,
neither cumulative sedation, nor total delirium was predictive of poorer
MMSE score at the time of ICU discharge.
Conclusions: In critically ill ICU patients, length and depth of sedation
and the total days of delirium were found to be associated with poorer
memory functioning at the time of ICU discharge. These findings support previous research that has linked delirium to post-ICU memory
impairment. Additionally, the results suggest that the level and duration
of sedation may play an even greater role in the development of early
memory impairment.

K. SULLIVAN & D.R. SEICHEPINE. Multiple Self-Reported
Brain Injuries are Associated with Increased Health Symptoms
in a Cohort of 1990-1991 Gulf War Veterans.
Objective: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) was recently associated with
chronic health symptoms reported by Gulf War (GW) Veterans. Repetitive TBIs, even mild (mTBI), are linked to poor health in other cohorts,
but to our knowledge have not been examined in GW Veterans. The aim
of this study was to determine if GW veterans reporting multiple mTBIs
also endorse higher rates of health symptoms.
Participants and Methods: Two hundred and twenty nine male 19901991 GW Veterans (mean age=55.8±8.3) from the Ft. Deven’s Cohort
endorsed the presence or absence of 34 health symptoms over the last 30
days. Veterans were categorized according to self-reported frequency of
mTBIs defined by the American Academy of Neurology’s current guidelines: no mTBIs (n=72), one mTBI (n=26), two TBIs (n=25), and three
or more mTBIs (n=106). A one-way ANOVA was performed with mTBI
group as the independent variable and total number of health symptoms
as the dependent variable. Post-hoc analyses utilized Tukey’s HSD test.
Results: Age was similar between mTBI groups (F=2.04,p=0.109). A
significant overall difference of total health symptoms by mTBI group
was found (F=13.94,p<0.001). Post-hoc analyses showed Veterans reporting two mTBIs or three or more mTBIs had significantly higher
rates of health symptoms than Veterans reporting no mTBIs (p=0.007
and p<0.001).
Conclusions: GW Veterans self-reporting two or more mTBIs also indicated significantly higher rates of symptoms. This suggests GW veterans
may have fully recovered from one mTBI, but sustaining two or more
may be contributing to chronic health problems. These findings could
be applicable to other Veteran populations (e.g. OEF/OIF).

K. SULLIVAN & M. KRENGEL. Self-Reported Exposures to Mild
Traumatic Brain Injury and Neurotoxicants Predict Current Total
Health Symptoms in a Cohort of 1990-1991 Gulf War Veterans.
Objective: Gulf War (GW) Veterans have reported chronic health symptoms since returning from war nearly 25 years ago. Environmental
exposures are believed to be an etiologic factor, however, history of mild
traumatic brain injury (mTBI) has recently been raised as a potential
contributor. The aim of the present study was to examine the relation
between environmental exposures and mTBI with current health symptoms in GW Veterans.
Participants and Methods: Two hundred and fifty-six (male=229)
1990-1991 GW Veterans (mean age=55.6±8.3) from the Ft. Deven’s
cohort endorsed the presence or absence of 34 health symptoms over
the last 30 days. Veterans also self-reported frequency of mild TBIs
defined by the American Academy of Neurology’s current guidelines.
Exposure to Agent Orange, chemical or biological warfare (e.g. scud
missiles), anthrax vaccine, and pyridostigmine bromide (PB) were also
self-reported. Linear regressions were performed with exposures as the
predictor variables and total number of health symptoms as the dependent variable.
Results: The initial model was significant when all predictor variables
were entered into the regression (p<0.001). Using backward elimination Agent Orange, anthrax vaccine, and PB were removed from the
model. The final model revealed exposure to chemical or biological
warfare (β=0.389,p<0.001) and mTBI (β=0.222,p=0.003) predicted
total health symptoms.
Conclusions: Exposure to mTBI and chemical or biological warfare
predicted total number of health symptoms. This may support the multihit hypothesis, which suggests multiple insults to the central nervous
system induce chronic neuroinflammation potentially causing chronic
health problems. This data could influence future treatment targets for
GW veterans.

Challenging the Phonological/Deep Dyslexia Continuum: A Case
Study.
Objective: Deep dyslexia (DD) is an acquired reading disorder characterized by semantic paralexias and impairments in nonword reading.
One theory of DD proposes that it is an extreme variant of phonological dyslexia (Glosser & Friedman, 1990; Crisp & Lambon Ralph,
2006), and thus that phonological impairment is the core deficit in DD.
This continuum hypothesis predicts that patients with mild DD (who
make few semantic errors) should be relatively sensitive to phonology. However, in a series of experiments by Gooding, Danguecan, and
Buchanan (2014), a patient with mild DD (GL) had more difficulty
naming pictures preceded by phonemic cues than by semantic cues. This
demonstrated insensitivity to phonology challenges a continuum theory
of phonological/deep dyslexia. The objective of the present study is to
further assess GL’s sensitivity to phonology by evaluating his recognition
speed of real words in the context of a task that places fewer demands
on phonological output.
Participants and Methods: GL completed three visual lexical decision
tasks in which he was required to distinguish real words from non-pronounceable nonwords, pronounceable nonwords, or pseudohomophones.
Results: Consistent with previous research, GL responded fastest to
words in the non-pronounceable nonword condition. Unexpectedly however, GL responded faster to words in the pseudohomophone condition
than in the pronounceable nonword condition.
Conclusions: Together with Gooding et al.’s (2014) findings, these
results may suggest that GL is insensitive to phonology on certain tasks,

314
which is inconsistent with a continuum theory of phonological/deep
dyslexia. Notably, an alternative model of DD proposed by Buchanan,
McEwen, Westbury, and Libben (2003) known as the Failure of Inhibition Theory may be easily accommodated to account for the present
data. Such a modification proposes that there may be qualitative (not
just quantitative) differences between phonological and deep dyslexia.

A. FONG, C. TUFO & P. DONOVICK. Do Bilinguals Have an
Advantage in Learning a New Language?
Objective: Our research was designed to address whether greater years
of language instruction in a classroom setting facilitates language acquisition of a completely novel language. We examined this relationship in both bilingual and monolingual groups. We hypothesized that
there would be a difference in language acquisition ability, where those
who received more years of language instruction in a classroom setting
would perform the task better, and that bilinguals would perform the
task better.
Participants and Methods: 71 undergraduate participants disclosed
their language history, including level of proficiency in languages and
years of formal language instruction, through a self-reported survey.
We chose to teach words in Tibetan, as it was a language that few
students had contact with. We provided audio samples of 12 Tibetan
words followed with their English translations. Short-term recall was
tested through the presentation of the auditory samples for 3 trials.
Participants were asked to write down the English translation following
a Tibetan-only auditory cue. Long-term recall was tested with one trial
of the Tibetan-only auditory cue.
Results: We found that there was a positive correlation between the
years of formal language training and number of correct translation
responses both in short term recall (r=.328, p=.005) and long term
recall of Tibetan words (r=.419, p < .001). Greater years of language
instruction in a classroom setting correlated with greater translations
remembered. There was no significant difference in the number of translations recalled between the bilingual and monolingual groups.
Conclusions: We found that having a greater number of years of language instruction in a classroom setting results in better performance
in learning a completely novel language. These results indicate that
foreign education training in classrooms is beneficial for those seeking
to acquire a new language later in life.

J.P. JOHNSON, K. ROSS & S. KIRAN. Evaluating Responsiveness
to Treatment and Generalization in Patients with Acquired
Reading and Writing Deficits.
Objective: Dyslexia and dysgraphia in persons with aphasia (PWA)
are responsive to treatment but the extent of recovery is variable. This
study aimed to determine if a novel treatment improved PWA’s single
word reading or writing and generalized to an untreated modality and
untreated words.
Participants and Methods: Five PWA (age range 44-72 years) received
eight weeks of treatment for oral reading (n=2) or writing to dictation
(n=3). Each was treated on 16 words using a 13-step protocol targeting
lexical and sublexical processes. Treatment effects were monitored on
treated words and orthographically or semantically related words in
both modalities. Accuracy was assessed pre- and post-treatment and
probed at each session. Response to treatment was analyzed via logistic
regression predicting the odds of a correct response over the course of
treatment and slope analysis of accuracy on each treatment step.
Results: Four PWA significantly improved their log odds of a correct
response in the trained modality and two did so in the untrained modality (all ps<.01). Two PWA showed signs of generalization to untreated
but related words. All PWA who improved in treatment increased their

accuracy on steps involving independent reading or writing, while three
improved on spelling with letter tiles, phoneme to grapheme conversion
and delayed reading or writing (all ps<.05).
Conclusions: Results suggest the treatment improves PWA’s written
language skills and promotes generalization. Key treatment steps require immediate or delayed reading or writing, scaffolded spelling and
sublexical conversion. Patient factors such as locus of impairment likely
contribute to variability in improvement. Future research will examine
whether these factors predict patient performance and will align patient
profiles with the most essential treatment steps to promote recovery.

P.T. LAI & A.R. LOPEZ. Language and Prosodic Measures
in Typically Developing Children and Children with High
Functioning Autism.
Objective: The goal of this study is to better characterize how schoolage children produce language during a dyadic naturalistic conversation
focusing on prosodic measures.
Participants and Methods: Children (ages 7-14) were asked questions such as “What did you do over the weekend”; “Can you tell me
about your siblings”. Children encounter these types of questions on a
daily basis, and thus, this situation reflects everyday verbal interactions.
Typically Developing children (TD; n=22) and children with High Functioning Autism (HFA; n=22) participated. Based on the total length of
the interview, the video was separated into beginning, middle, and end.
Within each segment, 8 seconds of continuous speech from the child
was collected. PRAAT, a linguistic program that parses out the various
aspects of prosody was used to analyze mean pitch, range pitch, mean
intensity, and range intensity.
Results: For pitch and range of pitch, no differences were observed
between the two groups. Interestingly, a large amount of variance was
observed for pitch in the HFA group. A follow-up analysis investigating
variability between the two groups resulted in a significant difference
(p-0.018), the HFA group was more variable with regards to pitch than
the TD group. This result suggests that children with HFA are producing speech with a more variable pitch pattern than TD children when
conversing with an adult on everyday topics. For intensity, a significant
difference was observed as the HFA group was creating more intense
speech (p=0.026) than the TD group. A trend was observed for range
of intensity (p=0.118), with the HFA group having a larger range than
the TD group.
Conclusions: Taken together, during naturalistic speech, children with
HFA are more variable in their pitch patterns and are more intense
compared to their TD peers. These results can better help define the
social and communicative profile of our groups, and future research can
begin linking aspects of communicative behaviors to potential underlying neural mechanisms.

S. LEVÄNEN, K. TIIPPANA & E. VILKMAN. Influence of Visual
Speech on Audiovisual Speech Perception in Language-Impaired
Children.
Objective: Speech perception in children with and without developmental language impairment (LI) was investigated by presenting auditory
and audiovisual speech stimuli in noise and in noise-free conditions. In
addition, visual speech-reading abilities were evaluated.
Participants and Methods: The participants were 5–6 year-old children diagnosed with LI, and a sample of typically developing (TD) children. In addition to auditory, visual and congruent audiovisual speech
stimuli, the participants were presented with an incongruent McGurk
stimulus, where the consonant uttered by the voice (auditory /aPa/)
differed from that articulated by the face (visual /aKa/).

Forty Fourth Annual INS Meeting Abstracts
Results: Although both LI and TD children were inaccurate while perceiving consonants in noise and gained from the visual input in congruent audiovisual stimuli, LI children were significantly worse at the task
in all auditory and congruent audiovisual conditions. In addition, they
were worse at visual speech-reading. Finally, while TD children were
strongly influenced by the visual input in McGurk stimuli, LI children
gave both /aTa/ and /aKa/ responses. There were no differences in the
auditory responses (/aPa/) between LI and TD children. Auditory, visual
and audiovisual speech perception did not differ between LI children
who had problems predominantly either in speech production or in
understanding speech.
Conclusions: LI children had clear deficits in speech-in-noise perception and at visual speech-reading. This was reflected in poorer performance in perceiving congruent audiovisual speech. Responses to
the McGurk stimuli reflected their poorer speech-reading ability, i.e.
children with LI confused visual /aKa/ with /aTa/. These results show
that speech perception problems in LI occur both in auditory and visual
domain.

A.R. LOPEZ & P.T. LAI. Sustainable Language Production in
Typically Developing Children and Children with Focal Lesions.
Objective: The goal of this study is to better characterize how schoolage children produce language in a naturalistic conversation. Language
production and prosodic variables were captured to investigate how
children interact in a dyadic interview with an adult.
Participants and Methods: Children between the ages of 7-14 years
old participated and were asked questions such as “what do you and
your sibling do for fun” or “what did you do on your vacation”. Based on
the total length of the interview, the video was separated into beginning,
middle, and end. Within each segment, 8 seconds of continuous speech
were indicated as either completed or incomplete. Two separate group
comparisons were examined. First, typically developing children (TD;
n=24) were divided into two groups; the first group consisted of children
producing sustainable language (three full segments of 8 seconds of
speech; n=11), and the second group of children unable to sustain language production (did not complete all three segments of speech; n=13).
Our second comparison examined language production in children with
focal lesions. Participants include children with Left Hemisphere Injury,
LHI; n=8 and children with Right Hemisphere Injury, RHI; n=11.
Results: Full scale IQ, performance IQ, mean pitch, range pitch, mean
intensity, and range intensity all were not significant in these two TD
groups. Verbal IQ score was able to separate the two TD groups, with
higher verbal IQ scores for the TD children able to complete all three
segments of speech (p=0.04). Results indicated that the majority of the
LHI was not able to complete all three segments (1/8), while over half
of the RHI was able to sustain language production (6/11).
Conclusions: These results suggest that once TD children speak, their
prosodic levels are similar in the two groups, while TD children with
higher verbal IQ are more talkative. As well as suggest the LHI group
is having a tough time producing sustainable language, while the RHI
group is more inline with the TD group at this age.

S.B. PILLAY, W.L. GROSS, C. HUMPHRIES & J.R. BINDER. Brain
Regions Mediating Recovery of Word Reading in Phonological
Aphasia: An Event-Related fMRI Study.
Objective: Damage to the perisylvian phonologic system is common in
aphasia and can cause severe deficits on oral reading, yet most patients
with damage to this system recover the ability to read some words.
Neuroimaging studies show a variety of brain activity changes in in
people with chronic aphasia, but whether these changes truly support
successful performance or reflect increased task difficulty is not clear.
The variable success observed in people with aphasia on overt reading

315
tasks makes it possible to examine the neural responses associated with
correct and incorrect responses.
Participants and Methods: Participants included 21 chronic left hemisphere ischemic stroke patients with a phonologic retrieval deficit. The
fMRI task required participants to read aloud 72 concrete nouns. Correct
and incorrect trials were used as regressors of interest in a deconvolution
analysis. The Correct – Incorrect contrast images were then used in a
second-level group analysis, thresholded at voxel-wise p < .01, and
cluster corrected to p < .05. An index of each patient’s phonological
impairment severity was included as a covariate in the group analysis to
improve detection by accounting for between-subject variability.
Results: Successful word reading was associated with activation in the
left angular gyrus (AG). In contrast, activation in bilateral posterior
inferior frontal cortex and SMA was greater for incorrect word trials.
Conclusions: These data show the brain regions where neural activity
is correlated specifically with successful phonological retrieval in chronic
aphasia. The AG has been linked with semantic processing in healthy
controls, which suggests that additional recruitment of the semantic
system contributes to successful word production when the phonological
retrieval mechanism is damaged. Greater activation of posterior inferior
frontal cortex and SMA during incorrect trials may reflect secondary
engagement of attention, working memory, and error monitoring processes when phonological retrieval is unsuccessful.

M. PURDY & J. MCCULLAGH. The Impact of Dichotic Listening
Training on Auditory Comprehension in Aphasia.
Objective: The lesions producing aphasia following a stroke often occur in the areas associated with auditory processing (AP). Auditory
functioning is considered to be a significant component of aphasia and
recovery of AP is important in the rehabilitation of individuals with
aphasia. Several studies have identified AP deficits in individuals with
aphasia and some have found correlations between dichotic listening
and language tasks, particularly auditory comprehension and sentence
repetition. However, little research has been conducted on the rehabilitation of dichotic listening and changes in auditory comprehension.
The purpose of this pilot study was to explore the impact of using the
Dichotic Interaural Intensity Difference (DIID) training on the comprehension and speed of processing of auditory commands of increasing
length and complexity
Participants and Methods: Two individuals with chronic mild aphasia
and dichotic listening deficits, documented through standardized peripheral and central audiological assessments, participated in auditory
training for 60 minutes per day, 3 days per week, for 4 to 6 weeks.
DIID training was completed using dichotic letters, numbers, words,
and sentences. Training included both binaural integration and separation tasks with intensity bias for the weaker ear. Auditory language
processing was assessed pre- and post- DIID training using the Revised
Token Test (RTT).
Results: Although specific performance patterns varied among the
participants following treatment, improvements in the performance on
the Competing Sentences test and the Words in Noise test indicated
improvements in the weaker ear for both participants. Gains were also
documented on the RTT, demonstrated by more accurate and prompt
responses. These results indicate increased volitional direction of attention and efficiency of processing.
Conclusions: DIID training may be a useful treatment for auditory
processing deficits in aphasia.

J. SAVOIE, J. VILLERS & M. SHORT. Boston Naming Test
Performance among French-speaking Acadians in Canada.
Objective: The purpose of this study was to a) examine name agreement
on the Boston Naming Test (BNT-Kaplan, Goodglass & Weintraub,
2001) in French-speaking Canadians living in New Brunswick compared to French-speakers in Quebec (Roberts & Doucet, 2011) and b)
examined the effect of using different normative data when calculating
scores to determine levels of impairment (i.e., above average, average,
low average, borderline and impaired).
Participants and Methods: One hundred and nineteen participants
completed the study (mean age=44.3; mean years of education=14.4).
Participants completed a French-Canadian version of the Language
Experience and Proficiency Questionnaire (LEAP-Q; Marian, Blumenfeld & Kaushanskaya, 2007) followed by the administration of the
BNT in French for those identified as unilingual French-speakers and
counterbalanced French and English versions of the BNT for bilingual
French-speakers.
Results: Name agreement analysis was performed and revealed similar
frequency of correct items for many, but not all, items. Overall, classification levels differed significantly (t(118)=27.45, p<.001) when using
the current data set versus the BNT original norms. Seventy four percent
of participants were classified as impaired, compared to only 5.1%,
when using the original versus current normative data. A small number
of participants (n=7, 5.9%) retained their classification levels, while a
large number (n=73, 61.9%) changed three levels of classification (e.g.,
impaired to average).
Conclusions: In conclusion, slight differences in name agreement across
a French-Quebec sample and the current French-Acadian sample were
revealed, but overall difficulty level of items were more similar across
French samples (Acadian vs Quebec) than compared to English. Classification levels differed signficantly across normative data sets and
supports the need for separate norms for French-speakers. The study
further highlights the implications of proper normative data for diagnosis and assessment of language impairments.

Logopenic Progressive Aphasia in Patient with Meningioma:
Neuropsychological Evaluations Over Time.
Objective: Logopenic Progressive Aphasia (LPA) is a variant of Primary
Progressive Aphasia (PPA) characterized by word finding difficulties
and phonemic paraphasias, as well as impaired repetition, naming,
and sentence comprehension, while single word comprehension and
reading remain intact. LPA may also be associated with acalculia and
apraxia. This rare language disorder is poorly understood and clinicians
are rarely given an opportunity for serial evaluation. Additionally, as
many patients are already significantly impaired across domains at the
time of initial testing, it can be difficult to evaluate the nuances of language-dominant neurodegenerative disorders. The following presents
serial testing of a medically complex patient in order to illustrate the
characteristics of LPA in a typical patient.
Participants and Methods: A case study report of an older adult male
is presented with data from Neurology and Neuropsychology collected
at approximately yearly intervals spanning a three-year period. This patient had a complex medical history, including a history of a right-sided
frontal lobe meningioma and subsequent craniotomy, and neuroimaging
reports and other important medical information will be reviewed.
Results: Over time, the patient evidenced initial intact memory consolidation with mild declines over three years. However, there was remarkable decline in his expressive language abilities, including naming,
repetition, comprehension and spontaneous speech, while single word
comprehension remained intact. He also exhibited increased executive
dysfunction and frontal release signs. Full results, including neuroimaging results, will be discussed in the poster.

Conclusions: This case demonstrates the complexity of assessment and
diagnosis of neurodegenerative disorders, particularly those related to
language. In particular, this case highlights the need for serial neuropsychological evaluations and interprofessional collaboration to aid in
effective treatment for patients with complex medical histories.

Symposium 16. Disentangling Autism
Symptomology Across Pathologies:
Investigations of Shared Phenotypic Traits
Chair: Brian Willoughby

1:00–2:30 p.m.
B. WILLOUGHBY, D. COMAN, J. PINEDA, K. DOOLEY &
E. BRAATEN. Disentangling Autism Symptomology Across
Pathologies: Investigations of Shared Phenotypic Traits.
Symposium Description: Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is neurodevelopmental condition characterized by social communication impairment and restricted and repetitive behaviors. Children with ASD show
symptoms or “traits” commonly thought to be specific to autism, such
as sensory issues (e.g., tactile sensitivity), restricted interests (e.g., preoccupation with a particular topic), and social communication deficits
(e.g., poor conversational skills). However, the prevalence of these ASD
traits across other childhood disorders (e.g., ADHD, Psychosis, Anxiety)
remains unclear. The current symposium examines ASD traits across
other child psychiatric conditions. In the first presentation, Dr. Drew
Coman discusses the presence of sensory abnormalities across children
with ASD, Psychosis, Mood Disorders, ADHD, and anxiety. In the second
presentation, Dr. Jill Pineda will present on social deficits and restricted
and repetitive behaviors in children with ASD versus other clinical disorders. Lastly, Dr. Kimberly Dooley will share her investigation of the
ASD diagnosis as a potential moderator of the relationship between
social difficulties and internalizing/externalizing problems in children
and adolescents. Drs. Ellen Braaten and Brian Willoughby, who serve
as chair and discussant, will bring their research and clinical expertise
on ASD to highlight the implications of key findings. By demonstrating
that the traits thought to be “hallmarks” of ASD cut across several other
childhood conditions, the current symposium has implications for both
clinical practice and theoretical conceptualizations of neuropsychiatric
illness.

Spectrum Disorders (ASD): An Investigation of a Shared Phenotypic
Trait Across Other Major Psychiatric and Neurodevelopmental
Conditions.
Objectives: To investigate sensory abnormalities across probands with
formal diagnoses of Psychosis, ASD, Mood Disorders (MD), ADHD, and
Anxiety (ANX), and demonstrate both differences and commonalities
among these groups. To elucidate the relationship between sensory abnormalities and internalizing and externalizing problems across these
conditions and test for moderation.
Participants & Methods: 675 probands aged 6 to 18 years were recruited
as part of the Longitudinal Study of Genetic Influences on Cognition.
Diagnoses were confirmed and data were collected via neuropsychological evaluation. Parents completed a Developmental History Form
and the CBCL.

Forty Fourth Annual INS Meeting Abstracts
Results: Group differences in the total number of experienced sensory
abnormalities were observed, F(4, 622) = 13.88, p <.001, η2 = .08,
such that the ASD group had a higher frequency relative to only three
of the four other groups. Groups did differ on some, but not all sensory
abnormalities, including sensitivity to noise, χ2 (4, n = 675) = 5.99, p
= 0.20, temperature, χ2 (4, n = 675) = 3.83, p = 0.43, sensory seeking,
χ2 (4, n = 675) = 2.02, p = 0.73, and others (e.g., sensitivity to pain),
χ2 (4, n = 675) = 4.84, p = 0.30. Controlling for confounds, total frequency of sensory issues, R2 = .32, F(4, 404) = 75.13, p < .001, β =
0.16, t(404) = 3.64, p < .001, was associated with internalizing problems across sample. This relationship was not supported in Psychosis,
MD, or ANX. Tests of moderation and associations with externalizing
problems were not supported.
Conclusions: While certainly prevalent in ASD, sensory abnormalities
are not unique to this disorder relative to other groups (i.e., Psychosis).
Particular sensory problems (e.g., auditory, tactile, sensory-seeking)
are equally as common across conditions as well. Higher frequencies of
sensory processing issues may only be associated with higher levels of
internalizing disorders in youth with ASD and ADHD. Sensory issues
can be a “red herring” in assessment.

J. PINEDA, D. COMAN, N. DOTY, K. DOOLEY, H. DITMARS,
B. LEE, A. DOYLE & E. BRAATEN. Investigation of Restricted
and Repetitive Behaviors Across Clinical Populations.
Objective: While restricted and repetitive behaviors (RRBs) are most
strongly associated with an Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), research
has found that they can also occur in a number of other central nervous
system disorders (OCD, Schizophrenia), as well as typical development
(Turner, 1999, Frith & Done, 1990; Tracy et al., 1996). This shared
sequela over a number of other clinical disorders has important implications when assessing for symptoms associated with ASD. Furthermore,
research has found that several executive processes are highly related
to RRBs in ASD (Lopez, Lincoln, Ozonoff, & Lai, 2005). This study
examines the frequency of RRBs across a number of clinical populations, as well as the relationship between elevated levels of RRBs and
executive dysfunction.
Participants and Methods: 538 participants age 6-18 were recruited as
part of an ongoing investigation of youth presenting for psychological
assessment at a hospital-based clinic. Parents rated social impairment
and the presence of RRBs on the Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS),
and executive functioning on the Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function (BRIEF). Additionally, clinician determined presence of a
primary diagnosis of Psychosis, ASD, Mood Disorder, Attention Deficit
Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and Anxiety was considered. Frequency
and between-group differences were assessed for total SRS scores, as
well as RRBs rated on the SRS.
Results: While ASD had significantly higher rates of overall social impairment than most clinical populations, rates of social impairment in
Psychosis were not significantly different than ASD on the SRS; however, RRBs were significantly higher in ASD than all other populations.
In a linear regression model, elevated levels of RRBs predicted higher
rates of executive dysfunction.
Conclusions: Results suggest that RRBs may be helpful in differentiating
ASD from Psychosis and treatment of RRBs may be helpful across other
clinical disorders.

H. DITMARS, J. BLAIS, B. LEE, E. BRAATEN & A. DOYLE. Autism
Spectrum Disorder Diagnosis as a Potential Moderator of the
Relationship Between Social Impairment and Externalizing/
Internalizing Problems.
Objective: By definition, children and adolescents with an Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) have difficulties with social skills. Research has
also found that up to 50% of epidemiological and community samples
of patients diagnosed with ASD have a co-occurring anxiety disorder
(Kerns & Kendall, 2012), and there is evidence that a higher level
of anxiety is predictive of lower social skills (Chang, Quan, & Wood,
2012). Additionally, elevated externalizing symptoms are also common
among children with ASD. However, social skill deficits, internalizing
symptoms, and externalizing problems can occur in youth without an
autism spectrum disorder. This study examines an Autism Spectrum
Disorder diagnosis as a potential moderator of the relationship between
social difficulties and internalizing/ externalizing problems in children
and adolescents.
Participants and Methods: 57 participants aged 6-18 were recruited as
part of an ongoing investigation of youth presenting for psychological
assessment at a general hospital. Parents rated social impairment on
the Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS), internalizing problems on the
Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL), and externalizing problems on the
CBCL. Additionally, clinician determined presence of an Autism Spectrum Disorder was also considered.
Results: In linear regression models, youth internalizing/ externalizing
problems were not predicted by interaction between social impairment
and ASD diagnosis. The association between social difficulties and internalizing/externalizing problems was not impacted by an ASD diagnosis.
Conclusions: Results suggest that the impact between social difficulties
and psychopathology (specifically internalizing and externalizing symptoms) was similar for youth diagnosed with ASD and those who are not.

M.H. BEAUCHAMP, M.H. BEAUCHAMP, M. KEIGHTLEY,
B. BROOKS, K.O. YEATES & R. ZEMEK. Predictors and
Outcomes of Pediatric Concussion: Insights from the Prospective,
Multicenter 5P Project.
Symposium Description: Concussion, a form of mild traumatic brain
injury, is a highly prevalent public health problem, resulting in a range
of somatic, motor, cognitive and socio-emotional symptoms. Functional
changes in these domains can in turn lead to reduced quality of life in
both the short and long term. Children and adolescents may be especially sensitive to the effects of concussion due to the instability of
cognitive and social functions coming online during early development,
as well as their physiological vulnerability. Despite this, few well-powered studies have examined the predictors and outcomes of pediatric
concussion across a range of domains. The Predicting and Preventing
Postconcussive Problems in Pediatrics project (5P) aimed to identify
the key risk factors for developing post-concussive symptoms and to
determine the predictors of persistent neuropsychological, neuromotor
and behavioral problems. The goal of this symposium is to present an
integrated view of pediatric concussion via the findings of the 5P neuropsychological sub-study (n = 311, 6-18 years) at one and three months
post-injury. Dr Roger Zemek, emergency physician and 5P lead investigator, will give an overview of the main project and provide discussion

318
points pertaining to four individual presentations. First, developmental,
clinical and cognitive predictors of neuropsychological outcome will be
addressed. Second, we will explore neuromotor performance as indexed
by measures of grip-strength, balance, and manual coordination. The
third presentation will focus on psychological outcomes including anxiety and depression. Finally, we will consider how neuropsychological,
motor, and psychological indicators are associated with patient quality
of life after concussion. The symposium will provide knowledge on the
pre-morbid and clinical risk factors for poor outcomes after pediatric
concussion and an understanding of their association with the evolution
of injury in the first three months.

R. ZEMEK. Predictors of Neuropsychological Outcome after
Pediatric Concussion.
Objective: Pediatric concussion is not known to result in long-term cognitive and motor deficits (Yeates, 2010), but acute or transient difficulties may nonetheless affect functioning. Accurate outcome prediction is
useful for identifying children at risk for poor prognosis and optimizing
recovery. A sub-goal of the 5P study (Zemek et al., 2013) was to identify
predictors of persistent neuropsychological difficulties after concussion.
Participants and Methods: 287 participants (6-18 years, M=11.6,
SD=3.1, 109 female) completed cognitive and fine motor tasks one
month post-injury. Global outcomes were dichotomized via a Neuropsychological Impairment Rule (NPI, Beauchamp et al., 2015). Pre-morbid
(sex, prior concussion, learning disability, ADHD, etc), acute symptoms
(amnesia, loss of consciousness, etc) and acute testing (Post-Concussion
Symptoms Inventory, Standardized Assessment of Concussion) predictors were subjected to univariate logistic regression. Those significant
at the .01 level were entered into a three step hierarchical logistic
regression.
Results: The overall model significantly predicted NPI (p<0.01). In
the first step, pre-morbid variables contributed significantly, though
no individual variable contributed uniquely. Symptom variables introduced in the second step also contributed (χ2=8.73, df=3, p=0.03),
with an independent association between the presence of amnesia and
NPI (aOR=2.26, 95%CI: 1.04-4.90, p=.02). Consideration of acute
testing further contributed (χ2=8.86, df=1, p<0.01), with the SAC independently predicting NPI (aOR=0.72, 95%CI: 0.58-0.90).
Conclusions: A combination of pre-morbid and acute medical and cognitive factors predict neuropsychological outcome after pediatric concussion. These results contrast with reports that only factors pre-dating
injury predict cognitive outcome (ex: Babikian et al., 2013). Amnesia
and acute cognitive deficits may be associated with more persistent
neuropsychological difficulties and poor recovery.

N. DESIRE, K.O. YEATES & R. ZEMEK. Neuromuscular and
Neuromotor Performance following Pediatric Concussion.
Objective: Concussion is a common injury amongst youth. Muscle
weakness, decreased strength and impaired balance is commonly associated with more serious brain injuries, but remains relatively understudied in pediatric concussion. This study describes performance on
physical functioning measures in children and youth.
Participants and Methods: In a planned substudy, children aged
6-17 years with acute concussion were enrolled from the emergency
departments of 4 Canadian pediatric hospitals as part of a larger prospective multicentre cohort (5P Study). At 4 and 12 weeks post injury,

participants completed a battery of neuropsychological and physical
functioning tests including hand grip strength (a measure of neuromuscular performance), grooved pegboard (a neuromotor performance
task) on both dominant and non-dominant hands and the Balance Error
Scoring System (BESS). Performance was considered impaired if children scored 1.5 standard deviations (SD) below the normative mean.
Results: 311 children were enrolled, of which 25.6% and 19.9% were
impaired at 4 weeks on dominant and non-dominant hand grip strength,
respectively. By 12 weeks post-concussion those frequencies were 37.0%
and 15.5%, respectively. 13.3% and 11.2% were considered impaired
on the grooved pegboard test 4 weeks post-concussion for the right
and left hands, respectively. At 12 weeks post-injury these frequencies were 7.7% and 10.8%, respectively. There were no significant
associations between hand grip strength and neuropsychological test
scores, post-concussion symptom scores or balance scores taken pre- or
post-concussion. In contrast, left hand grooved pegboard performance
was significantly (albeit weakly) associated with the number of errors
on the tandem stance condition of the BESS at 4 weeks post-concussion
(r = -0.13, p < 0.05).
Conclusions: Neuromuscular performance was frequently impaired in
children 4 and 12 weeks post-concussion which could lead to increased
risk for re-injury.

R. ZEMEK. Psychological Functioning after Pediatric Concussion.
Objective: Psychological functioning after concussion is an important
area of clinical and research focus. Limited existing research suggests
that problems with anxiety and mood may be present early in recovery
and typically resolve over time. The objective of this observational study
was to examine psychological functioning in children and adolescents
who have sustained a concussion.
Participants and Methods: 311 youth (6-18 years, M=11.8, SD=3.1,
35.0% female) who completed neuropsychological testing at 4 and 12
weeks post-concussion. These participants were part of a larger multicentre, cohort study (Zemek et al., 2013). Psychological measures
included the anxiety/depressed and withdrawn/depressed subscales
from the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL), and the emotional distress
subscale from the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ).
Results: Mean T scores on CBCL subscales were within normal range
at both 4 and 12 weeks. There were not significant differences over time
in the proportion of youth who fell within the clinical ranges for anxiety
(week 4, 8.0%; week 12, 4.7%; p=.17) or depression (week 4, 4.7%;
week 12, 2.6%; p=.25). There were not significant differences between
boys and girls or between age groups (5-7, 8-12, or 13-18 years). Youth
with multiple prior concussions and youth who took longer than 1 week
to recover from their prior concussion had significantly worse anxiety,
depression, and emotional distress symptoms at 4 weeks post-injury
(ps<.001) but not 12 weeks. Youth with persistent post-concussion
symptoms had significantly more psychological problems at both 4
and 12 weeks (ps<.05).
Conclusions: Youth who sustained multiple previous concussions and
have taken more than 1 week to recover from a prior injury have more
psychological problems at 4 weeks, but not at 12 weeks post acute
concussion. Youth with persistent post-concussion symptoms at both 4
and 12 weeks have elevated psychological concerns.

& R. ZEMEK. Neuropsychological Functioning as a Predictor of
Quality of Life after Pediatric Concussion.
Objective: Neuropsychological functioning can be affected acutely in
pediatric concussion, but its relationship to quality of life in this population is uncertain. We sought to examine neuropsychological functioning
as a predictor of quality of life after childhood concussion.
Participants and Methods: At 4 weeks post-injury, 197 6-18 year old
children from the larger multicentre 5P study completed measures of
IQ, attention, executive function, memory, processing speed, and fine
motor skills. Results were classified as impaired or not impaired via
a published Neuropsychological Impairment Rule (NPI). Participants
also rated post-concussive symptoms (PCSI) at 4 weeks post-injury and
quality of life (PedsQL) at 12 weeks. Variables assessing demographics,
premorbid history, and acute clinical presentation were subjected to
univariate regressions predicting PedsQL scores. Significant univariate predictors were entered into hierarchical regression analyses, with
4-week symptom and NPI status added in the last two steps.
Results: The overall model significantly predicted the PedsQL total
score and all subscale scores. Demographic and premorbid history variables collectively accounted for significant variance in the PedsQL total
score and all subscales (R2 change = .15-.23), although no individual
variable was an independent predictor. Acute clinical presentation did
not predict PedsQL scores. Symptom status was a significant predictor
of the PedsQL total score and three of four subscales (R2 change = .02.04). NPI status did not predict PedsQL scores after controlling for all
other variables.
Conclusions: Demographics, premorbid history, and postconcussive
symptoms are significant predictors of quality of life among children
with concussion. When those variables are controlled, neuropsychological functioning is not associated with quality of life. The findings have
implications for the utility of neuropsychological testing after pediatric
concussion.

A.E. BLANKEN & D.A. NATION. Endophenotypes of Preclinical
Alzheimer’s Disease Empirically-Derived from Both Cognitive and
Cerebral Spinal Fluid Biomarkers.
Objective: Previous studies have established separate biomarker and
cognitive signatures of preclinical Alzhiemer’s disease (AD). The present study aimed to use a combination of markers to identify distinct
neurocognitive profiles of preclinical AD and compare their rates of
progression to dementia.
Participants and Methods: We performed hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) using Ward’s clustering linkage on baseline cognitive scores
(Boston Naming Test, AVLT, the Logical Memory, Categorical Fluency, Trails A & B) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarker (amyloid
beta 1-42 and p-tau) data from 367 normal control (NC) and 610
mild cognitive impairment (MCI) subjects from the Alzhiemer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI 1/GO/2) in order to objectively
determine subgroups characterized by cognitive performance and biomarker status. We computed ANOVAs to examine group differences in
cognitive performance and biomarker status, and Cox regression was
applied to investigate the effect of group membership on rate of disease
progression.
Results: Three different subtypes resulted from the HCA: a cognitively
normal (N=624) with normal biomarker status, an amnestic group
(N=216) with a biomarker profile consistent with preclinical AD, and a

319
mixed impairment group (N=137) had advanced cognitive impairment
in diverse domains and elevated biomarkers . The mixed impairment
group was significantly less impaired in memory and displayed less
biomarker elevation than the amnestic group. Decline towards dementia
was significantly more rapid for the two cognitively impaired groups.
Conclusions: A complete neurocognitive profile is important for AD
diagnosis and prognosis. The combination of neuropsychological test
scores and CSF biomarkers were useful for identifying groups with
distinct patterns of preclinical AD features. Disease characterization
using these, and possibly other AD biomarkers, may reveal clinically
unique subgroups of early AD.

CSF Biomarkers and Cognitive Decline in Autosomal Dominant
Alzheimer’s Disease.
Objective: Little is known about cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers and cognitive decline in autosomal dominant Alzheimer’s disease
(ADAD). Describing this relationship is critical for defining the transition from cognitive normality to the symptomatic phase of Alzheimer’s
disease (AD) and for establishing the efficacy of ADAD cohorts for
secondary prevention trials.
Participants and Methods: 167 participants from the Dominantly
Inherited Alzheimer Network (DIAN) observational study completed
comprehensive neuropsychological testing and CSF collection at baseline and returned for at least one additional visit. Groups were defined
by mutation status and severity of symptoms using the Clinical Dementia Rating Scale (CDR) and included CDR 0 Asymptomatic Mutation
Carriers (as-MC, n=56), CDR > 0 Symptomatic Mutation Carriers (sMC, n=54), and Non-Carriers (NC, n=57). Cognitive performance on
22 tests was used to form composite scores for cognitive domains and
a global composite measure. Linear mixed effects models examined
whether baseline CSF biomarkers predict cognitive decline in DIAN.
Results: Beta amyloidosis and neurodegeneration as measured by CSF
AB1-42, t-tau, and p-tau181 were strongly associated with longitudinal decline across nearly all cognitive domains. Asymptomatic mutation-carriers closer to their estimated year of symptom onset (EYO)
showed elevations in t-tau and elevated t-tau/Aβ1-42 ratios that were
strongly associated with declines in episodic memory and global cognitive performance, suggesting that cognitive decline accelerates when
substantial neurodegeneration is present.
Conclusions: In the DIAN population, cognitive decline in symptomatic
carriers and asymptomatic carriers appears to be related to tau-mediated
neurodegeneration as measured by CSF biomarkers. These findings are
similar to studies in sporadic AD and suggest that CSF AB42 is less sensitive than CSF t-tau and p-tau181 for the detection of cognitive decline.

state functional connectivity of the default mode network in
middle-aged individuals with a parental history of Alzheimer’s
disease.
Objective: Previous neuroimaging studies indicate that there is a long
preclinical phase of AD where cognitively-healthy, middle-aged individuals with AD risk factors display alterations in brain structure/function
in default mode network (DMN) regions many years prior to the onset
of cognitive decline. We used resting-state functional connectivity MRI
(rsfcMRI) to examine the influence of the APOE e4 allele on DMN functional connectivity in the adult children of persons diagnosed with AD.

320
Participants and Methods: Seventy middle-aged (40-65 years of age)
children of persons with AD underwent genetic testing, neuropsychological evaluation, and neuroimaging. There were 38 APOE e4 carriers
and 32 non-carriers. We examined the relationship between APOE genotype and seed-based rsfcMRI. Time series were extracted from 5mm
radius spheres in left/right hippocampus, posterior cingulate and medial
prefrontal cortices. Results were considered significant at p=.05, uncorrected; cluster size [k]=100.
Results: The e4 allele was associated with 1) greater connectivity between left hippocampus and right anterior medial temporal lobe, but
with reduced connectivity in bilateral precuneus; 2) greater connectivity
between right hippocampus and left inferior/middle temporal lobe, but
reduced connectivity in right posterior thalamus; 3) greater connectivity
between midline posterior cingulate and bilateral occipital, inferior/
middle temporal, and right parietal regions; 4) greater connectivity
between medial prefrontal cortex and bilateral occipital and left inferior
temporal regions, but reduced connectivity with left posterior cingulate
and lateral parietal regions.
Conclusions: The APOE e4 allele is associated with both greater and
reduced functional connectivity between DMN regions in middle-aged
individuals with a parental history of AD, indicating that preclinical
changes in brain connectivity can be observed prior to cognitive changes.
Future studies examining the interactive effects of parental history and
the APOE e4 allele are needed.

A. MINOR, S. MAYERS, T. HOHMAN, A.L. JEFFERSON &
K. GIFFORD. Social and cognitive factors relate to the presence
of subjective cognitive decline in non-demented older adults.
Objective: Subjective cognitive decline (SCD) may predict cognitive
decline and diagnostic progression to Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Little
research has examined factors that may increase or reduce SCD. The
current study examined how social activity or engaging in cognitive
compensatory strategies related to SCD in non-demented older adults.
Participants and Methods: Participants included 1120 cognitively
normal (NC; 69±8 years, 56% female) and 250 mild cognitive impairment (MCI; 76±10 years, 52% female) individuals from the Vanderbilt
Memory & Alzheimer’s Center participant registry. All completed a
Telephone Interview for Cognitive Status (TICS), 196-item SCD survey,
and depression screen (CESD). SCD was defined as the total score of
the SCD-survey with higher scores indicating more SCD. Diagnostic
status was determined using the TICS. Modifying factors included 1)
endorsement of “Do you participate in hobbies and activities as often
as usual?” and 2) use of compensatory strategies as measured by the
mnemonics subtest of the Memory Functioning Questionnaire. ANOVA
and regression related these factors to SCD, adjusting for age, education,
and depression.
Results: Lower cognition was related to more SCD (B=-6.2, p<0.001).
Decreased activity participation was related to higher SCD scores in
NC (F(1,1086=12.7, p<0.001) and MCI (F(1, 234=5.0, p=0.03). Engaging in more compensatory strategies related to higher levels of SCD
in NC (B=1.86, p<0.001) and MCI (B=1.90, p=0.001). There was no
interaction between participation and strategy use (F(1,1312)=0.03,
p=0.9) but individuals with high strategy use and low participation
showed the most SCD.
Conclusions: A protective factor for AD, engagement in social activities,
may minimize the presence of SCD. Utilization of more compensatory
strategies may increase the likelihood of an older adult reporting SCD
and could signal early cognitive problems. Further research into the
interplay between SCD and modifying factors is needed.

W.E. KLUNK. The Cognition-Mobility Interface is Associated with
Cerebral Amyloid Deposition in Clinically Normal Older Adults.
Objective: Amyloid-beta (Aβ) is deposited in the regions that control
cognition and mobility. We sought to study the association between Aβ
and the cognition-mobility interface (COMBINE) in clinically normal
elders.
Participants and Methods: Cognitively normal older adults enrolled in
a longitudinal Pittsburgh Compound-B (PiB) PET study to characterize
Aβ were screened for mobility impairment. Blinded to their Aβ status,
we measured usual gait speed on the Gait Mat II. We assessed the COMBINE by measuring RT and accuracy on motor sequencing, response
inhibition and working memory tasks and on dialing a phone while
standing and while walking. We compared the COMBINE, measured
by the magnitude of gait speed and cognitive performance decline while
walking, in high- and low- Aβ groups ((PiB(+) and PiB(-) respectively).
Multiple linear regressions explored the association between COMBINE
and global PiB retention.
Results: PiB(+) (n=16) and PiB(-) (n=12) groups were comparable
in age (75yrs), general cognition and physical function, white matter
hyperintensities, usual gait speed and on working memory, response
inhibition and motor sequencing task performance. The PiB(+) group
demonstrated greater gait speed decline than the PiB(-) group on the
response inhibition and motor sequencing tasks (both p=0.03) and while
dialing a phone (p=0.008). Greater global PiB-PET correlated with
greater gait speed decline during the motor sequencing and response inhibition tasks (both r=0.4, p=0.04) and the phone dialing while walking
tasks (r=0.39, p=0.04) but not with usual gait speed, standing cognitive
task performance or cognitive performance decline while walking. The
association between magnitude of gait speed decline while dialing a
phone was statistically significant (p=0.03) despite adjustments.
Conclusions: Gait speed decline on the response inhibition, motor sequencing and phone dialing tasks is associated with Aβ in older adults.
Dialing a phone while walking may serve as a “stress test” to screen
healthy older adults for high Aβ load.

Cognitive Complaints Predict Conversion to MCI and Alzheimer’s
Disease Dementia.
Objective: The clinical value of specific subjective cognitive complaints (SCC) in healthy people is unclear even though neuroimaging
and biomarker studies suggest SCC are early preclinical symptoms of
future objective cognitive decline. The purpose of this study was to
examine whether cognitively healthy older subjects with self-reported
“significant” complaints in memory, judgment, language, orientation,
and attention domains have greater risk of developing Mild Cognitive
Impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer’s disease dementia (AD) than those
without “significant” SCC.
Participants and Methods: This study utilized 10 years of longitudinal
data from the Boston University Alzheimer’s Disease Center research
registry. Registry participants are examined annually based on the National Alzheimer’s Coordinating Center’s Uniform Dataset and receive
diagnoses based on a multidisciplinary diagnostic consensus conference. Participants also receive structured interviews regarding SCC.
We identified 235 participants aged 55 and older who were initially
cognitively unimpaired. For each participant, we determined if objective
cognitive decline occurred (resulting in MCI or AD dementia diagnosis)
and whether a specific SCC domain preceded decline. Using logistic and
survival models, we investigated whether each SCC domain increased
the likelihood and rate of developing MCI or AD.
Results: A significant memory complaint but no other domain SCC
greatly increased the odds of conversion to AD dementia (odds ratio =

Forty Fourth Annual INS Meeting Abstracts
7.898, p-value < .01). Moreover, significant SCC in any domain other
than judgment increased the odds of having future objective cognitive
decline, including MCI. These findings were independent of the presence of psychiatric disorders (depression and anxiety), age, sex, and
education.
Conclusions: SCC are an early preclinical indicator of MCI and AD dementia and should be considered a meaningful early symptom of future
decline in individuals without current objective cognitive impairment.

and hemoglobin values relate to worse cognitive performance in
older adults: The Vanderbilt Memory & Aging Project.
Objective: Animal studies suggest that cerebral hematocrit declines in
aging. The purpose of this study is to assess whether lower hematocrit
(red blood cell volume) or hemoglobin (oxygen-transport metalloprotein
in the red blood cells) is related to neuropsychological performance in
older adults with normal cognition (NC) and mild cognitive impairment
(MCI).
Participants and Methods: Participants were drawn from the Vanderbilt Memory & Aging Project, a case-control longitudinal study investigating vascular health and brain aging. At enrollment, NC participants
(n=163, 72±7 years, 40% female) and MCI (n=165, 73±8 years, 41%
female) underwent fasting blood draw and neuropsychological assessment. Multivariable regression related hematocrit or hemoglobin (separately) to all neuropsychological outcomes, adjusting for age, diagnosis,
Framingham Stroke Risk Profile, creatinine clearance, body surface
area, and APOE4 status.
Results: Lower hematocrit level was related to worse performance on
Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA, p=0.003), Boston Naming Test
(BNT, p=0.02), Biber Figure Learning Test (BFLT) Discrimination
Trial (p=0.01), and Tower Test (p=0.01). Lower hemoglobin was related to worse performance on MoCA (p=0.001), BNT (p=0.02), BFLT
Long Delay Recall (p=0.03), BFLT Discrimination Trial (p=0.003),
and Tower Test (p=0.03).
Conclusions: Findings suggest that among adults age 60 and older both
lower red blood cell volume and lower oxygen-transport metalloprotein
are associated with worse global cognition, visuospatial memory, lexical
naming, and planning. Future work will assess whether longitudinal
changes in hematocrit or hemoglobin affect cognitive aging, structural
brain changes, or cerebral blood flow.
