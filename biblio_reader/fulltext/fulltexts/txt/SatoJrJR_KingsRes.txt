Abstract
Functional brain hubs are key integrative regions in brain networks. Recently,
brain hubs identified through resting-state fMRI have emerged as interesting
targets to increase understanding of the relationships between large-scale
functional networks and psychopathology. However, few studies have directly
addressed the replicability and consistency of the hub regions identified and
their association with symptoms. Here, we used the eigenvector centrality
(EVC) measure obtained from graph analysis of two large, independent
population-based samples of children and adolescents (7 to 15 years old; total
N = 652; 341 subjects for site 1 and 311 for site 2) to evaluate the replicability of
hub identification. Subsequently, we tested the association between replicable
hub regions and psychiatric symptoms. We identified a set of hubs consisting of
the anterior medial prefrontal cortex and inferior parietal lobule/intraparietal
sulcus (IPL/IPS). Moreover, lower EVC values in the right IPS were associated
with psychiatric symptoms in both samples. Thus, low centrality of the IPS was
a replicable sign of potential vulnerability to mental disorders in children. The
identification of critical and replicable hubs in functional cortical networks in
children and adolescents can foster understanding of the mechanisms
underlying mental disorders.

Introduction
Graph theory has been increasingly applied in the analysis of
connectivity in neuroimaging data. Graph-theory-derived centrality measures,
especially eigenvector centrality (EVC), can rank the relevance of a node in a
complex network (Zuo et al., 2012) in terms of strategic location. This feature is
particularly useful for exploring the etiology of mental disorders that are
associated with functional alterations at a network rather than a focal level
(Fornito et al., 2015; Sporns, 2014; He et al., 2016). However, there is currently
a lack of consistent findings from independent large samples in the literature
(Horga et al., 2014). In particular, few studies have investigated if central
functional brain regions in children and adolescents are replicable across
different sites of acquisition (Zuo et al., 2012). In addition, even fewer studies
have explored the replicability of associations between network-level disruptions
and dimensional psychopathology in childhood.
Previous studies of human structural and functional brain networks have
identified a set of highly connected brain regions (i.e., hubs) (Power et al.,
2013). These hubs are believed to play a central role in the flow of information
throughout the brain, integrating parallel and distributed networks (Gong et al.,
2009; Hagmann et al., 2008; Hwang et al., 2013). Structural connectivity studies
have shown that hubs are mainly located at integrative cortical areas in adults
(Power et al., 2013; Sporns et al., 2007). In the adult brain, functional cortical
hubs include the medial prefrontal cortex, posterior cingulate cortex (PCC),
precuneus, inferior parietal lobule (IPL; particularly the angular gyrus) and
medial temporal cortex (Buckner et al., 2009). Moreover, Betzel et al. (2014)
have noted that functional hub regions are affected by changes in white matter
connections and that the relationship between functional and structural
connectivity changes with age.
Two major gaps can be drawn from the current neuroimaging literature of
children and adolescents: (i) the replicability across different samples; and (ii)
the differential effects of hubs over neurodevelopment. Several resting-state
fMRI studies of large samples of children and adolescents have been carried
out, but in healthy developing children as opposed to clinical samples (Grayson

et al., 2014; Sato et al., 2015; Supekar et al., 2009; Uddin et al., 2011; Hwang
2013). Evidence for a typical developmental trajectory emerged from these
studies: large-scale networks apparently shift from a locally segregated to a
more distributed and integrated organizational pattern (Fair et al., 2008; Fair et
al., 2009; Fair et al., 2007; Fransson et al., 2011; Gao et al., 2009; Supekar et
al., 2009). Interestingly, in infants, hubs have been identified in primary
sensorimotor regions as opposed to the association cortex, where hubs have
been identified in adults (Fransson et al., 2011). Hwang et al. (2013) showed
that the connectivity between frontal hubs and other brain regions increases
from childhood to adolescence. However, Khundrakpam et al. (2013) described
developmental changes in the topological properties of the networks that
suggested an organizational shift towards a more random configuration.
Moreover, Zuo et al. (2012) demonstrated the test-retest reliability of EVC in
functional connectivity networks over a subject age range of 7-85 years old.
Therefore, despite the emergence of several brain regions as potential hubs of
intrinsic brain connectivity in children, few studies have investigated which
regions are most replicable across different samples (Horga et al., 2014). This
is a crucial point for progress in biological psychiatry. In addition, many findings
from early resting-state fMRI studies were limited by the issue of head micromotion artifacts (Power et al., 2012). These movement artifacts are also related
to age and influence functional connectivity estimates, complicating the
interpretation of results.
The fact that hub regions constitute potential points of vulnerability for
network disintegration is a key issue (Albert et al., 2000). Indeed, the
abnormalities associated with several brain disorders have been shown to
concentrate in hubs; such disorders include ADHD (dos Santos Siqueira et al.,
2014), autism (Ray et al., 2014) and schizophrenia (Tomasi and Volkow, 2014).
As such, hub disruption has been proposed as a general pathological
mechanism in brain disorders (Crossley et al., 2014; van den Heuvel and
Sporns,

2013).

Therefore,

description

of

atypical

neurodevelopmental

trajectories of the brain connectome appears crucial to unveil the neural
substrates of mental symptoms and disorders (Di Martino et al., 2014).

However, full characterization of these functional networks and possible
differences in their architecture in childhood has not yet been achieved.
Here, we first sought to explore the replicability of mapping regions with
high EVC values in children and adolescents. Then, we investigated the
hypothesis that diminished or “impaired” centrality of these hubs would reliably
correlate with psychopathological symptoms in two independent, populationbased cohorts of children and adolescents. For these purposes, we analyzed
resting-state fMRI data acquired using identical acquisition protocols from two
large samples of children and adolescents who were recruited at two different
centers in Brazil.
Materials and Methods
Subjects
The children and adolescents who participated in this study were part of
the ‘High Risk Cohort Study for Psychiatric Disorders in Childhood’ (HRC, N =
2512 children; for a detailed description see Salum et al., 2013, 2014). This is a
population-based sample of children from among the 9937 students of 57 public
schools in two Brazilian cities: São Paulo (site 1) and Porto Alegre (site 2). The
members of the HRC cohort were screened using a modified version of the
Family History Screen (Weissman et al., 2000). Nine hundred fifty-eight
subjects were randomly selected, and 1554 were selected based on their risk of
developing psychiatric disorders (using the same criteria at the two sites; Salum
et al., 2013, 2014); these individuals comprised the 2512 subjects of the HRC.
Among the total of 2512 volunteers, 741 subjects (and their
parent/guardian) accepted the invitation for MRI scanning session. Functional
MRI data were acquired from these subjects using the same acquisition
protocol at the two sites. Eighty-one participants were discarded due to an
incomplete session, missing data, observable excessive motion (as identified by
the system operator) or preprocessing errors (failure in registration to the
template/atlas).
Thus, 652 remaining subjects were considered in the analyses of the
current study. Because this was a community sample, participants were not

discarded depending on IQ. The mean age (years) ± standard deviation (sd) of
the participants was 10.81 ± 2.00 at site 1 and 10.58 ± 1.75 at site 2, with ages
ranging from 7 to 15 years at both sites. Three hundred forty-one subjects were
scanned at site 1 (165 males, 159 randomly selected) and 311 at site 2 (179
males, 139 randomly selected).
The local ethics committee approved this study. Written consent was
obtained from all of the parents (or legal guardians), and verbal assent was
obtained from all of the participants.

Assessment
IQ was estimated using the vocabulary and block design subtests of the
Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (in a household interview) and the
approach of Tellegen and Briggs (1967). The socioeconomic status of the
families was classified according to the Brazilian rating scale (ABIPEME, 2010;
low = E and D classes; medium = C and B classes; high = A class):
The parents/caregivers filled out a Portuguese-translated version of the
Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) (Achenbach and Rescorla, 2001) on the day of
scanning. This assessment tool provided scores for psychopathological
manifestations. The total CBCL score is a measure of overall psychopathology.
It represents the sum of points for 112 CBCL items (0, 1 and 2 points per item),
including the 8 syndromes described by the questionnaire (anxiety/depression,
withdrawal/depression, somatic, rule breaking, aggression, social problems,
thought problems and attention problems) as well as other symptoms not
classified with any syndrome. The total CBCL score is a common measure of
overall psychopathology. The analyses were carried out only for the total CBCL
scores and not for scores on all the subscales to reduce the number of multiple
comparisons and because the subscale scores are highly correlated with low
specificity.

Data Acquisition

Recreational activities were performed for desensitization on the day of
scanning. The neuroimaging data were acquired using two 1.5 T MR systems
(Signa HDX and HD from the same manufacturer - G.E., United States of
America) using the same parameters and protocols. The fMRI acquisition
protocol consisted of 180 EPI dynamic volumes with the following parameters:
TR = 2000 ms; TE = 30 ms; slice thickness = 4 mm; gap = 0.5 mm; flip angle =
80 degrees; matrix size = 80 x 80; reconstruction matrix = 128 x 128, 1.875 x
1.875 mm; NEX = 1; number of slices = 26; and total acquisition time = 6
minutes. Resting-state scans were acquired while the subject’s eyes were open
and fixated on a target. Alongside the functional images, T1-weighted scans
(3D FSPGR sequence) were collected to cover the whole brain, up to 160 axial
slices (TR = 10.91 ms; TE = in phase 4.2 ms; thickness = 1.2 mm; flip angle =
15 degrees; matrix size = 256 x 192; FOV = 24.0 x 18.0 cm; and NEX = 1).

Data Preprocessing
The neuroimaging data were preprocessed using AFNI (version
2011_12_21_1014) (Cox, 1996) and FSL software (version 5.0) (Jenkinson et
al.,

2012).

We

used

the

following

steps

(scripts

from

www.nitrc.org/projects/fcon_1000): discarding of the first four volumes of EPI;
skull stripping; head motion correction; despiking; rescaling to a grand mean of
10000; band-pass filtering (0.01 and 0.1 Hz); detrending; spatial smoothing
(FWHM = 8 mm); linear registration to the subject’s structural scan; structural
image non-linear registration to the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI152)
template; non-linear registration of functional scans; and regression out of
nuisance covariates (CSF, white matter, global signal and six linear motion
parameters). The scrubbing method proposed by Power et al. (2012) was
applied to minimize the impact of head motion. Scans (frames) were discarded
(flagged frame as well as one before and two after) if the corresponding framewise displacement (FD) or the temporal derivative of the RMS variance over the
voxels (DVARS) was greater than the 95th percentile of all subjects with
successful processing (FD > 0.5 mm and DVARS > 46.4).

Network Modeling
For each subject, the average BOLD signal was extracted from 325
similarly sized regions of interest covering the whole brain (Patel et al., 2014);
these ROIs were defined using previously established algorithms (Zalesky,
2011). Although some notable studies (Zuo et al., 2012) have used a voxel-wise
approach to construct connectomes, we opted to use a ROI-based approach for
two main reasons: (i) voxel-wise analyses would considerably increase the
positive correlations between regions due to spatial smoothing and data
redundancy; and (ii) the number of comparisons in subsequent statistical testing
would be increased from the order of hundreds to tens of thousands. A pairwise
Pearson correlation was calculated between every pair of ROIs, and these
correlations were then used to index the strength of functional connectivity.
A graph is a mathematical object that can be used to represent networks
in general (social, brain, transport networks, etc.). This representation facilitates
the extraction of some descriptive features and quantitative analyses. In the
current study, the ROIs are the graph nodes, and edges represent the
functional connectivity between them. To avoid arbitrary choices of functional
connectivity, we modelled an undirected weighted graph by using the absolute
value of the Pearson correlation coefficients as the weight of the connections.
This approach has some limitations because it considers correlated and “anticorrelated” networks in the same manner, which may make interpreting this
graph from a physiological perspective difficult. We discuss this limitation in the
Discussion section. In addition, short-distance correlations might be affected by
spatial smoothing, slicing and head movement (Grayson et al., 2014; Power et
al., 2013); thus, we discarded connections between ROIs that were less than 20
mm apart.
The EVC of a node is a metric obtained from graph analysis that
quantifies the relevance of a node (i.e., a brain region in this case) in the
context of the organization of connections of the network. In other words, some
nodes interact with the whole network more than others, and these key nodes
are named hubs. Thus, to investigate the hierarchical organization of the wholebrain network, we ranked all of the included ROIs according to their EVC. The

EVC of a brain region is proportional to the EVC of its connected regions
(Bonacich, 1987). In this sense, EVC also considers how the neighbors
(connected regions) of a node are connected to the network. This is a wellestablished method in graph analysis that is used to investigate the hierarchical
relevance of a node, or its ‘hubness’, in the context of the global features of a
network (Rubinov and Sporns, 2010). For each subject, the EVC of the nodes
was calculated by the eigenvector corresponding to the greatest eigenvalue of
the correlation matrix (in absolute values) between the BOLD signal of the ROIs
(i.e., if A is the bivariate correlation matrix, the EVC is the vector x such that Ax
= mx, for the greatest m).
In the current study, we focused solely on EVC as the metric used to
identify hubs for the following reasons: (i) EVC provides a global measure of
centrality that takes into account not only the neighbors of a node but also the
context of the whole network; (ii) this metric is based on connection strength
(weights) and not distance (and is thus a straightforward choice regarding
functional connectivity. Otherwise, a distance metric based on correlations must
be defined); (iii) EVC displays good test-retest reliability, as demonstrated by
Zuo et al. (2012), and is sensitive for functional connectivity changes in children
and adolescents (Sato et al., 2015a, 2015b); and (iv) exploring other centrality
measures would at least double the number of comparisons.

Data analysis
We analyzed each site of acquisition separately, which allowed us to
assess the reliability of our analyses across the two samples. We first
calculated the mean EVC rank across subjects for every ROI. Subsequently, we
identified the overlap (across sites) of the top 10% (21 out of 325) of regions
with the highest EVC ranks. Then, a Monte Carlo analysis was performed to
assess the significance of the number of overlapping regions, preserving the
correlation structure between regions at each site. Finally, to demonstrate that
the replicability across sites was not dependent on the 10% threshold, we also
repeated the overlap analyses for the regions with EVC ranks within the top 5%
and top 1%.

Once these top 10% EVC hub regions were identified, we tested the
hypothesis that the subjects with hubs with lower EVC ranks would be more
likely to have psychiatric symptoms. For each region (from 21 hubs), a
univariate general linear model (GLM) was fitted, considering the total CBCL
score as the dependent variable; the EVC rank as the main regressor; and
gender, age and degree of head motion (measured by the mean FD) as
nuisance variables. Although EVC was the main variable of interest, the
nuisance variables - mainly FD - were included as covariates not to assess their
significance but to take them into account as potential confounders. Moreover,
to reduce the number of comparisons, we excluded brain regions with
suspected influences of head motion. The 21 GLMs were also performed
without FD as a covariate. Thus, the brain regions for which the EVC p-value
difference (with and without FD as a covariate) was greater than 5% were
excluded from results. The Type I error for the remaining regions was set at 5%
(uncorrected for multiple comparisons).

Results
Figure 1 highlights a strong replication (Pearson’s r = 0.91, p < 0.001) of
the ranks of the mean EVC (across subjects) for brain regions in the two sites,
especially for regions with high and low EVC values; more variability was
observed in the intermediate values. Our main result was the overlap (across
sites) of 21 regions within the set of regions with EVC scores within the top 10%
(see Table 2). For the top 5% and 1%, the number of overlapping regions was
11 and 2, respectively. The p-value for the comparison of the number of
overlapping regions was less than 0.001 (Monte Carlo method), regardless of
the threshold (10%, 5% and 1%) considered.
As shown in Figure 2, the individual variability in the EVC scores of the
overlapping regions was relatively low, with similar results for both sites. Figure
3 shows brain maps of the hub regions that overlapped across the sites. Note
that regardless of the threshold considered, the anterior medial prefrontal cortex
(amPFC) and the IPL/intraparietal sulcus (IPS) were included among the most
relevant regions.

Regarding the GLM analyses of psychopathological manifestations, only
four regions were not strongly affected by the inclusion of head motion (FD) as
a covariate (Table 3). Among these four regions, the EVC rank of the right
intraparietal cortex (see Figure 4) was found to be negatively associated with
the CBCL score, a finding replicated at both sites (uncorrected p < 0.02 and
0.03 for site 1 and site 2, respectively). The box plots presented in Figure 4
(bottom) were built considering a quartile categorization of the mean EVC rank
(low if less than first quartile; high if greater than third quartile; typical
otherwise). The data were categorized this way solely for visualization purposes
(the statistical evaluation was carried out previously through a GLM in which
EVC was considered as a quantitative variable) because the association effect
is more evident in box plots than in scatter plots.
Regarding head motion, the mean FD (± sd) was 0.19 (± 0.29) for site 1
and 0.12 (± 0.12) for site 2. As expected, the EVC of the top 10% of regions
was significantly correlated (Pearson correlation) with the mean FD. However,
the Pearson correlation between mean FD and CBCL score was not significant
(p = 0.40 and 0.21 for site 1 and 2, respectively). In addition, we repeated both
the hub identification and CBCL analyses by considering only the subjects with
a mean FD < 0.2 mm. Only one of the previous 21 regions was not identified as
a replicable hub (the right Insula). The results of the CBCL analysis remained
the same (see Supplementary Table 1 for further details). We did not find any
significant association between EVC and estimated IQ in either of the two sites.
Finally, the findings were not altered by the inclusion of socioeconomic status
(SES) as an additional nuisance variable in the GLM analyses (Supplementary
Table 2).

Discussion
As integrative nodes, brain hubs play a key role in functional connectivity
networks. In the current study, we used two large and independent populationbased samples of children and adolescents to explore the consistency of the
identification of brain hubs under resting-state conditions and the associations
of these hubs with psychopathological symptoms. We first identified a set of

hubs that was replicated across both sites: the amPFC and the IPL/IPS. Within
this set of hubs, we found that a right IPS with lower EVC was associated with
the presence of psychiatric symptoms, a finding that was replicable across the
two samples.
In addition to the IPL/IPS and amPFC, other fairly consistent regions
(across gender and age) included the ventral medial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC),
medial temporal gyrus (mTG), precuneus and PCC. Many of these regions are
components of the default mode network (DMN) (Raichle et al., 2001; Raichle
and Snyder, 2007). The IPL/IPS and amPFC are associative areas and might
play a role as hubs in the cross-modal integration of cortical and subcortical
regions (Buckner et al., 2008). The amPFC is involved in social cognition (Wang
and Hamilton, 2014), metacognitive abilities for memory and perception (Baird
et al., 2013), evaluative judgment and self-referential processes (Zysset et al.,
2003). The IPS/IPL is part of the parietal cortex (Rademacher et al., 1992),
which has been characterized as a cross-modal hub of multisensory information
convergence (Seghier, 2013) and implicated in several cognitive processes.
Semantic processing and complex language functions frequently activate the
angular gyrus, for instance (Binder et al., 2009; Vigneau et al., 2006). In
addition, the right IPL is also involved in attentional maintenance, the encoding
of salient events (Singh-Curry and Husain, 2009), spatial cognition, internal
representations (Sack, 2009), social cognition (Buckner et al., 2008) and the
autobiographical memory system (Spreng et al., 2009). Thus, our findings
support crucial roles for the IPL/IPS and amPFC as integrative regions.
From a network dynamics perspective, the amPFC is part of the midline
core components of the DMN and may underlie the evaluation of experiences
with a high personal significance (Andrews-Hanna et al., 2010). In a detailed
study of the structural and functional changes that occur in the DMN, Supekar
et al. (2010) and Sato et al. (2015) showed that the connectivity between the
amPFC and PCC is immature in children. Our finding of a relative absence of
the PCC from the group of the most consistent hub regions, in contrast to the
amPFC, may be in line with this previous observation. Similarly, the IPS and IPL
are central integrative nodes of the frontoparietal component of the executive
control network (Dosenbach et al., 2007) and are thought to underlie top-down

control. Our results support a view in which the IPL/IPS and amPFC constitute a
stable (across the age range investigated) and replicable core of the
control/default mode network, with the PCC/precuneus and other parts of the
medial prefrontal cortex included as hubs.
Finally, we tested the hypothesis of an association between the
disruption of hub regions and the expression of psychiatric symptoms in
children and adolescents. As expected, lower values of centrality in a replicable
hub region, the right IPS, correlated with the increased expression of psychiatric
symptoms. Higher right IPS activity was previously found to be positively
correlated with better executive function among populations at risk for brain
disorders including mild cognitive impairment (Jacobs et al., 2012) and among
carriers of genes associated with predisposition to Parkinson’s disease (Thaler
et al., 2013). Moreover, right IPS activity was correlated with reduced symptom
severity in a subgroup of patients with schizophrenia (Bleich-Cohen et al.,
2014). This finding demands further investigation of the potential role of hub
impairment, particularly of right IPS, as a potential marker of vulnerability or as
part of the natural history of several neuropsychiatric pathologies.
Interestingly, in addition to the correlation of lower EVC values in the right
but not left IPS with psychiatric symptoms, the majority of hubs identified were
concentrated in the right hemisphere. Higher connectivity and centrality of the
right but not the left IPS was previously shown to be associated with improved
executive task performance (Marketti et al., 2015; Seeley et al., 2007).
Furthermore, there is evidence for asymmetric arrangements of large-scale
networks, including the DMN (Saenger et al., 2012). By simultaneously
acquiring EEG and fMRI, Biazoli et al. (2013) showed that BOLD activity in the
nodes of resting-state networks is correlated with an increased flow of
information from the right to the left hemisphere. Accordingly, stronger
connectivity was found in the right hemisphere, and causality measures
suggested a crucial functional role of this hemisphere during the resting state
(Medvedev, 2014).
Figure 3 highlights the replicated hubs in yellow, while the regions
depicted in red and green show the non-overlapping regions. Some of these

regions are nodes of the DMN, such as precuneus/posterior cingulate and right
temporal gyrus. In these cases, we believe the divergence between the two
sites may be due to sampling fluctuations. In addition, occipital and cerebellar
regions seem to be specific to one of the sites. Indeed, although the age and
gender distributions were similar between the two sites, the two samples
considerably differed in terms of psychiatric symptoms and levels of head
motion, as shown in Table 1. The participants at site 1 presented a wider range
of symptom severity and head motion, which may explain the between-sites
differences in brain hubs.
Finally, it is important to mention some of the limitations of the current
study. Although we used a scrubbing method, head motion artifacts may still
affect the analyses. This is an inherent challenge in neuroimaging studies
involving children, and the challenge is even greater when psychiatric
symptoms are present. We also tried to include FD as a possible confounder in
the GLM and discarded regions in which the p-value depended on FD.
However, head motion effects cannot be completely eliminated because these
artifacts may also be due to non-linear influences of motion on the signal or field
inhomogeneity. Despite reducing the number of comparisons by discarding the
analyses more prone to motion effects, the remaining four GLM analyses with
CBCL were not adjusted for multiple testing. Although the findings did not
persist after Bonferroni correction, the association between EVC and CBCL in
the IPS was replicated across the two sites when uncorrected p-values were
considered. In addition, we acknowledge that by using the absolute values of
the correlation coefficients as functional connectivity estimates, we could not
differentiate correlated and “anti-correlated” (negatively correlated) networks.
This assumption may not be an accurate representation of the underlying
neurophysiology, which may complicate the interpretation of the results. We
acknowledge that this approach is not optimal, but there is no established
framework (conceptual and methodological) for handling anti-correlated
networks in whole-brain analyses. When analyzing these data considering
solely the positive correlations between the ROIs, the results are very different
because the graph connectivity structure is altered. However, two of the main
resting-state networks are the default-mode and control networks (which were

part of our findings). Because the activities of both networks are negatively
correlated, using solely the connections with positive weights to define the
graphs would mask this antagonism. Moreover, some studies suggest that this
opposition is intrinsic, and the dynamic of cognitive control involves the union of
both systems (Fox et al., 2005; Hellyer et al., 2014). Finally, we emphasize that
one of the main limitations of the current study was the choice of parcellation
scheme. Indeed, the results are expected to vary according to the parcellation
atlas used because atlases differ with respect to the number of ROIs and the
size and location of the parcels. These differences strongly impact the
estimated functional connectomes. We opted to use an anatomical parcellation
based on predefined cortical and subcortical areas, but we recognize this is an
arbitrary choice.
In summary, our findings suggest that in late childhood and adolescence,
the amPFC and IPL/IPS play a role as integrative regions with high hierarchical
positions within the whole-brain network. Furthermore, we showed that
disruptions in the hierarchical position of the IPS are associated with
psychopathology.

These

results

point

towards

a

model

in

which

psychopathological manifestations are associated with disruptions of the typical
functional hierarchy of brain networks. Our findings are in agreement with
current hypotheses regarding the relationships between mental disorders and
abnormal connectomics (Fornito et al., 2015; Satterthwaite and Baker, 2015;
Sporns, 2014). Because this study is based on a pediatric sample, this result
might be explored as a potential feature that could be used to identify risk
factors in children and adolescents. Moreover, our sample is a community
sample based on a non-European/North American population from a developing
country, for which relatively few studies exist.

Figure 1: Scatter plot and Pearson correlation analysis of the mean EVC ranks
(of each brain region) between the two sites.

Figure 2: Analysis of inter-subject variability – Box plots (across subjects) of
the EVC ranks (within each site) of the 21 ROIs, separated by site. The ROIs
are the brain regions with mean EVC ranks within the top 10% and for which
this high centrality was replicated at the two sites of acquisition. The
coordinates of these brain regions are described in Table 2.

Figure 3: Brain regions with the top mean EVC scores across the two sites.
Overlapping regions are highlighted in yellow. The anterior medial prefrontal
cortex (superior frontal) and IPL/IPS were consistently included among the
regions with the top centrality ranks.

Figure 4: Association between EVC of the intraparietal cortex and
psychiatric symptoms – Brain map depicting the intraparietal cortex ROI (top)
and the significant association between its EVC rank and the symptom score
(bottom), which was replicated across the two sites.

Table 1: Demographical information in each site. The p-values comparing the
two sites were obtained by using two-sample t-tests (unequal variances) for
continuous variables and Pearson chi-square tests for SES, handedness and
gender.
