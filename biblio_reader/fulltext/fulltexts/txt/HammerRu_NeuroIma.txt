Finding neurobiological markers for neurodevelopmental disorders, such as attention deﬁcit and hyperactivity
disorder (ADHD), is a major objective of clinicians and neuroscientists. We examined if functional Magnetic
Resonance Imaging (fMRI) data from a few distinct visuospatial working memory (VSWM) tasks enables
accurately detecting cases with ADHD. We tested 20 boys with ADHD combined type and 20 typically developed
(TD) boys in four VSWM tasks that differed in feedback availability (feedback, no-feedback) and reward size
(large, small). We used a multimodal analysis based on brain activity in 16 regions of interest, signiﬁcantly
activated or deactivated in the four VSWM tasks (based on the entire participants3 sample). Dimensionality of
the data was reduced into 10 principal components that were used as the input variables to a logistic regression
classiﬁer. fMRI data from the four VSWM tasks enabled a classiﬁcation accuracy of 92.5%, with high predicted
ADHD probability values for most clinical cases, and low predicted ADHD probabilities for most TDs. This accuracy level was higher than those achieved by using the fMRI data of any single task, or the respective behavioral
data. This indicates that task-based fMRI data acquired while participants perform a few distinct VSWM tasks
enables improved detection of clinical cases.

1. Introduction
Attention-deﬁcit and hyperactivity-disorder (ADHD) affects 5–8% of
the worldwide childhood population, it has high comorbidity and it
shares symptoms with other behavioral and emotional disorders
(Boyle et al., 2011; Larson et al., 2011). ADHD prevalence rates vary
signiﬁcantly between and within countries, and depend on the ascertainment method and criteria utilized. Of particular concern is the
marked variability in diagnostic rates of ADHD in developed countries
(Getahun et al., 2013). This may reﬂect increased awareness of teachers
and parents to symptoms of ADHD in communities with a focus on
education and adequate health care. However, even within communities there is marked variability in rates of ADHD due to the subjective
nature of primarily descriptive (symptom-based) diagnostic procedures
(Asherson et al., 2012; Polanczyk et al., 2014; see also recent reports by
the US Center for Disease Control and Prevention). Such diagnostic
heterogeneity and its poor reliability have hampered efforts to
determine the pathophysiology of ADHD (Morgan et al., 2013).

Attempts have been made to ﬁnd neuroimaging-based biomarkers
of ADHD using structural Magnetic Resonance Imaging (Johnston
et al., 2014; Lim et al., 2013; Peng et al., 2013), resting-state functional
MRI (Hoekzema et al., 2014; Tomasi and Volkow, 2014), fMRI data
acquired during a single cognitive task (Hale et al., 2015; Hart et al.,
2014a; Hart et al., 2014b), or combinations of some of these techniques
(Anderson et al., 2014; ADHD-200 Consortium, 2012; Iannaccone et al.,
2015). These studies provide mixed insights regarding the possible
underlying neurocognitive deﬁcit of ADHD, and they report moderate
classiﬁcation accuracies (rarely exceeding 80%), insufﬁcient for clinical
diagnosis.
ADHD is characterized by behavioral symptoms and multiple cognitive deﬁcits associated with context dependent abnormal patterns of
neural activity distributed across multiple brain regions. Consequently,
ADHD is unlikely to be characterized by localized structural brain abnormalities robust enough to be detected using available structural imaging
techniques. It is also unlikely that signiﬁcant functional brain abnormalities characterizing ADHD would be evident regardless of the mental
state of the test subject, during the scan (Castellanos and Proal, 2012;
Hammer et al., 2015).
Key characteristics of ADHD include poor working memory, greater
reliance on external feedback, and abnormal reward processing. These

are associated with altered patterns of activity in distinct brain networks: (i) attention and working memory, comprising the dorsolateral
prefrontal cortex, parietal cortex and temporal cortices (Burgess et al.,
2010; Ehlis et al., 2008; Vance et al., 2007); (ii) executive functions
and cognitive control (including feedback processing and response
selection), comprising the dorsal, medial and ventral frontal cortices
(Booth et al., 2005; Clark et al., 2007; Sonuga-Barke and Fairchild,
2012); and (iii) reward-processing, comprising the orbitofrontal cortex,
anterior cingulate cortex and basal ganglia (del Campo et al., 2013;
Plichta et al., 2009; Volkow et al., 2009). Notably, there are substantial
individual differences in reactions to reward and feedback manipulation
in ADHD (Demurie et al., 2011; Dovis et al., 2015; Hammer et al., 2015;
Plichta and Scheres, 2014; van der Schaaf et al., 2013).
Accordingly, we hypothesized that using fMRI data from an
ensemble of visuospatial working memory (VSWM) tasks that differ
in the motivational context (determined by the availability of reward
and feedback) would increase the odds that abnormal patterns
of brain activity would be reliably detected in a larger proportion of
ADHD cases. We expected this to enable more accurate detection of
ADHD cases than the accuracies obtained by using fMRI data acquired
from any single VSWM task, or the accuracy based on the participant3s
respective behavioral performance.
Given the central role of VSWM in ADHD, we compared fMRI data
from four distinct VSWM tasks in boys with ADHD and typically
developed (TD) boys. Tasks differed in the availability of trial-by-trial
feedback (feedback versus no-feedback) and the participant3s expectation for signiﬁcant monetary reward (large versus small). All tasks
required tracking the spatial location of letters while ignoring the
letters3 identity, and executing timely responses. The manipulation of
feedback and reward provided different motivational contexts, each
requiring somewhat distinct executive skills found to be impaired in
children with ADHD.
We used a multimodal analysis based on relatively few brain regions
of interest, discovered using an independent univariate analysis
(Hammer et al., 2015; Morris et al., 2012; Mulligan et al., 2011; Thoma
and Henson, 2011). Using a sparse principal component analysis, we
further reduced the number of variables that were provided as input
to the classiﬁer. This substantially limited the odds of discovering an
overﬁtted ADHD classiﬁcation model, and simpliﬁed the interpretation
of the discovered model. We used a logistic regression (LR) classiﬁer,
which directly models the class conditional probabilities for each case
(i.e., calculating the predicted probability that a given child has ADHD)
by attempting to ﬁnd a model allowing a decisive classiﬁcation of as
many cases as possible. This attribute is important in clinical settings
where we aim to ﬁnd a model that allows classiﬁcation with conﬁdence
(Nouretdinov et al., 2011).

2. Materials and methods
2.1. Participants
Twenty boys with a diagnosis of ADHD combined-type (mean age in
years = 10.42 ± SD = 0.80) and 20 typically developed (TD) boys
(10.96 ± 0.91) participated in the experiment. Participants gave their
informed consent (and parental consent) in accordance with the policies of the Institutional Review Board (IRB) at Northwestern University.
At the time of the fMRI scanning session, ADHD youth were weaned off
stimulant medication for at least 24 h (12 participants used prescribed
stimulants on a regular basis during the time they participated in this
study). ADHD diagnoses were based on exceeding the clinical cut offs
on the ADHD rating scale (DuPaul et al., 1998) and the semistructured diagnostic interview, the Kiddie Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for School Aged Children: Present and Lifetime
(K-SADS-PL) version (Kaufman et al., 1997). A psychologist specializing

245

in ADHD reviewed all diagnoses. Mean total ADHD score was higher in
the ADHD group than in the TD group (Supplemental Table 1).
Participants were excluded if they had been diagnosed with a neurological disorder or were treated medically for a comorbid psychiatric
disorder. All participants were right-handed native English speakers
with normal or corrected to normal vision. Mean full-scale IQ scores
were within normal range in both groups, however the average IQ in
the ADHD group was lower than the average IQ in the TD group (Supplemental Table 1), which is not uncommon in ADHD studies
(e.g., Hart et al., 2014a).
2.2. Visuospatial working memory 2-back tasks
Participants performed four VSWM 2-back tasks while being
scanned in an fMRI scanner. Each task was 48 trials long. Before and
after each 2-back task the participant performed a ﬁxation task where
he was asked to press a key whenever the ﬁxation-cross changed its
color (which happened in 4/12 of the trials). Brain activity from the ﬁxation tasks was used as baseline. E-Prime ® 2.0 (Psychology Software
Tools, INC.) was used for stimuli presentation and for recording
participants3 responses (for more details about the experimental design,
see Hammer et al., 2015).
The two independent factors in the study were reward size (largereward versus small-reward) and presence of trial-by-trial feedback
(no-feedback versus feedback). In an earlier practice session, and at
the beginning of the scanning session, each participant was instructed
that the reward for each correct decision in the large-reward task was
10 times larger than in the small-reward task. In the trial-by-trial
feedback task, each key-press was followed by either a green square
(indicating a correct decision) or a red square (indicating an incorrect
decision) presented in the center of the screen. In the no-feedback
task, the participant was informed about his overall performance only
after concluding the task (Fig. 1). Order of the four tasks was
counterbalanced across participants.
2.3. MRI and fMRI data acquisition
Imaging data were acquired on a 3.0 Tesla Siemens Tim Trio scanner
using a 12-channel head coil. Gradient echo localizer images were
acquired to determine the placement of the functional slices. A susceptibility weighted single-shot EPI (echo planar imaging) method with
BOLD (blood oxygenation level-dependent) was used for functional
image acquisition with the following scan parameters: TR = 2000 ms,
TE = 20 ms, ﬂip angle = 80°, matrix size = 128 × 120, ﬁeld of
view = 220 × 206.3 mm, slice thickness = 3 mm (0.48 mm gap), and
number of slices = 32 (an effective functional voxel size of
2 × 2 × 4 mm). A total of 145 images (TRs) were recorded for each
scan. Slices were acquired in an interleaved manner. A high resolution,
T1 weighted 3D image was also acquired with the following parameters: TR = 2300 ms, TE = 3.36 ms, ﬂip angle = 9° matrix size =
256 × 256, ﬁeld of view = 256 mm, slice thickness = 1 mm, and
number of slices = 160. The acquisition of the anatomical scan took
approximately 9 min. Prior to the scanning session children were
trained in a mock scanner. This enabled conﬁrming that the participant
is capable of keeping his head still for the duration of the scanning
session. To minimize head movements in the scanner, gaps between
the participant3s head and the head-coil were ﬁlled with memory foam.
2.4. Image preprocessing
Data analysis was performed using MathWorks® Matlab, SPM8
(Statistical Parametric Mapping, Wellcome Trust Centre for Neuroimaging, London, UK), and IBM® SPSS. Preprocessing involved: (i) slice
timing; (ii) realignment of all functional images to the 24th image.
(iii) Co-registration of the functional and anatomical images; (iv) Normalization of the T1 image to the MNI305 template image, which is

two most distant fMRI images within a scan) in all translational
axes was no larger than the size of a voxel (i.e., 4 mm). There were
no signiﬁcant between-groups differences in any head translation
or rotation axes, all p N 0.25 (Supplemental Table 2). We also
conﬁrmed that it is unlikely that head movements underlie the
ADHD classiﬁcation results we got based on the brain activity data
(Supplemental Fig. 1).

2.6. Feature detection and dimensionality reduction based on the entire
participants3 sample

The four possible responses were: (i) hit — correctly responding that the location of the
current letter was identical to the 2-back letter; (ii) correct rejection (CR) — correctly
responding that the location of the current letter was different from the 2-back letter;
(iii) false alarm (FA) — incorrectly responding that the location of the current letter was
identical to the 2-back letter; and (iv) miss — incorrectly responding that the location of
the current letter was different from the 2-back letter when it was actually the same.

followed by 800 ms presentation of the Reward-Size symbol only. (C) A single trial in a
large-reward (symbolized by a picture of dollar bills) trial-by-trial feedback task. Letter
presentation was followed by 200 ms presentation of the Reward-Size symbol, which
was followed by the presentation of feedback for 600 ms (e.g., a green square indicating
a correct response).

most commonly used also for analyzing fMRI data of pediatric populations (e.g., Burgund et al., 2002; Ghosh et al., 2010; Peters et al., 2014;
Zhang et al., 2015). Linear and non-linear normalization parameters
were then applied to the functional images. (v) 4 × 4 × 8 mm full
width half maximum (FWHM) Gaussian kernel smoothing. (vi) We
conﬁrmed that movement was kept below 4 mm (in any of the x, y, or
z dimensions) within a scan using the ArtRepair software. Images (up
to 9 per scan) were realigned in ArtRepair, using interpolated values
from the two adjacent non-outlier images. Participants with extensive
head movements were rescanned (or excluded). For subsequent general linear model (GLM) analyses, the excluded noisy images were
deweighted. As reported in Supplemental Table 2, the two groups did
not differ in patterns of head movements, and the replacement of outlier
images primarily enabled reducing the signal to noise ratio in the fMRI
data of both groups. In order to further reduce within scan variability
in neural activity, only trials in which the participant responded correctly (hit and correct rejection) were modeled, with onset time-locked to
the beginning of each trial (Calhoun et al., 2005; Demir et al., 2014;
Hammer et al., 2015; Puschmann et al., 2013). This had only a small
quantitative impact on the reported ﬁndings. (vii) A high pass ﬁlter
with a cut-off of 256 s was applied.
2.5. MRI quality control and head movements estimate
Structural and functional brain images were inspected and found not
to have signiﬁcant image artifacts. We conﬁrmed that for each
participant maximal head displacement (the distance between the

Feature detection was based on a univariate GLM analysis, intended to
identify functional brain regions of interest (fROIs) that showed signiﬁcant activation or deactivation in all four VSWM tasks, contrasted with
all the ﬁxation tasks, using the brain activity data of the ADHD boys and
TD boys combined (total of 40 participants; see Chu et al., 2012; Friston,
2012 for discussions regarding optimal sample size). We found eight
fROIs showing signiﬁcant activation (VSWM N ﬁxation) and eight fROIs
showing signiﬁcant deactivation (ﬁxation N VSWM). We used a voxel
threshold of p b 0.01 (family wise error [FWE] corrected), and voxel cluster threshold of p b 0.01 (minimum cluster size of 50 voxels; FWE), where
each cluster had a single signiﬁcant peak at p b 0.05 (FWE). An anatomical
gray-matter mask (using the Talairach Daemon brain atlas gray-matter
mask, with dilate = 3), and a sphere mask with a radius of 15 mm
from each fROI peak voxel, constrained the fROI volume. These 16 ROIs
likely reﬂect the VSWM network in a broad childhood population, in
varying contexts (Fig. 2A).
For each participant we calculated the difference in mean Beta
values between each of the four VSWM 2-back tasks and the mean of
all ﬁxation tasks in each of the 16 fROIs (2-back–ﬁxation; ﬁxation−2back). Overall, given four VSWM tasks and 16 fROIs, the initial number
of features, characterizing each participant, was 64 (see Supplemental
Fig. 2 for activation proﬁles).
Given the relatively large initial number of features, and the high
correlations between some of the features (see Supplemental Fig. 3 for
the correlation matrix), we reduced the dimensionality of the data by
using a sparse principal component analysis (SPCA). This resulted
with a relatively small number of orthogonal principal components
(PCs), which together explained most of the variability in the data,
recalculated based only on the few features with the highest loadings
(Berthet and Rigollet, 2013; Ritchie et al., 2015; Zou et al., 2006). This
procedure has three major advantages: (i) SPCA enabled reducing the
number of variables fed to the classiﬁer to a number substantially smaller than the number of participants; (ii) recalculating the PCs based only
on features with the highest loadings enabled excluding lower weight
features that were likely to add mostly noise; and (iii) having each PC
being affected by relatively few features, where each feature affects at
most one PC, enabled better determining the underlying neurocognitive
mechanisms represented by each PC.
We used sparse loading selection based on thresholding of the
rotated loadings (loading threshold N 0.6; absolute weights N 0.1).
Loading rotation was based on the Varimax rotation method (Lu and
Zhang, 2012; Ma, 2013; Qi and Luo, 2015; Sjöstrand et al., 2006). The
use of this threshold resulted with 39 features (out of 64) affecting the
ﬁrst 10 PCs (PCs with eigenvalues N2), where each feature affected a
single PC (Fig. 2B). The ﬁrst 10 PCs explained approximately 70% of
the variability evident in the original 64 features. Each of the remaining
PCs explained less than 3% of the variability in the data. Interestingly, we
found each one of the ﬁrst 10 PCs to reﬂect brain activity from several
ROIs from the same VSWM task, but not brain activity in a speciﬁc ROI
in several tasks. The exception was PC-2, which was based on the
left and right middle frontal gyri in the two VSWM tasks without
feedback. This supports our hypothesis that functional brain-imaging
data from several distinct tasks is likely to add information useful for
classiﬁcation.

2.7. Logistic regression (LR) classiﬁcation algorithm
For the learning of the ADHD classiﬁcation model, we used a logistic
regression (LR) classiﬁer. The LR directly models the class conditional
probabilities for each case, attempting to decisively classify as many
cases as possible. A standard “jackknife” leave-one-out cross validation
(Zion Golumbic et al., 2013; Ponce-Alvarez et al., 2012) was used for
ﬁnding which of the 10 PCs signiﬁcantly contributed to classiﬁcation accuracy. In each cross validation iteration the LR classiﬁer was trained
based on the fMRI data of 39 participants, and then the goodness of ﬁt
of the learned model was evaluated based on the correlation between
the clinician diagnosis of the left-out participant (ADHD or TD) and
the LR classiﬁer predicted ADHD probability for this participant. This
procedure was repeated for all participants. The predictive power
from all iterations was averaged to determine which of the 10 PCs are
with statistically signiﬁcant predictive power, and for estimating the
predictive power of the ﬁnal model. The reporting of a classiﬁcation
model based only on signiﬁcant PCs has two advantages: (i) such a
model is less likely to be overﬁtted or biased due to being based on
too many predictors (PCs), and thus it provides a more conservative estimate of the classiﬁcation accuracies that can be achieved with the data
at hand and (ii) it further reduces the number of brain regions by which
the two groups of interest (i.e., ADHD vs. TDs) differ, enabling a more
parsimonious characterization of the differences in neurocognitive
mechanisms between the two groups (see Supplemental Fig. 5 for an
illustration of the data processing pipeline).

predicted probability values (PP N 0.67) assigned to most ADHD boys
(75%), and low values (PP b 0.33) assigned to most TD boys (80%;
Fig. 3), indicating a model with an excellent ﬁt (omnibus test for
model ﬁt, χ2(4) = 28.52, p b 0.0001). This accuracy level is not statistically different from perfect accuracy reﬂecting the clinician3s diagnosis
(100%), p = 0.12 (one-tailed Fisher exact test; testing the hypothesis
“LR classiﬁcation is the same as the clinician diagnosis”).
A permutation test shows that the classiﬁcation accuracies of the
above-described ADHD classiﬁcation model are unlikely to be discovered by chance. In each permutation, labels of half the cases from each
group were switched with the opposite group. The mean accuracy of
15 distinct permutations (62.0%) was signiﬁcantly lower than that of
the ADHD model (92.5%), p = 0.000 (exact test); t(14) = 14.97,

3. Results
3.1. ADHD classiﬁcation using the fMRI data from the four tasks
Running the LR with the leave-one-out cross validation showed a
statistically signiﬁcant contribution for ADHD classiﬁcation accuracies
for only four PCs (PC-2, p b 0.02; PC-3, p b 0.04; PC-4, p b 0.04; PC-8,
p b 0.02). Excluding each one of these four PCs from the classiﬁcation
model substantially impaired the classiﬁcation accuracies, whereas
adding any of the other six PCs did not increase the classiﬁcation
accuracies. The classiﬁcation accuracy of the model based on the four
statistically signiﬁcant PCs was 92.5%, with 95% sensitivity and 90%
speciﬁcity. Importantly, most of the classiﬁcation decisions had high

p b 0.0001 (one-tailed, one-sample t-test). Even the highest observed
accuracy of a permuted-labels model was close to being signiﬁcantly
lower (15%) than that of the ADHD model, p = 0.06 (one-tailed Fisher
exact test; testing the hypothesis “ADHD model is better than the best
permuted model”). The mean correct decisive classiﬁcation accuracies
(with PP b0.33 or PP N0.67) in the 15 permutations were 24.5%, versus
77.5% of the ADHD model, p = 0.000 (exact test), t(14) = 13.59,
p b 0.0001 (one-tailed, one-sample t-test; see also Supplemental Fig. 4).
3.2. ADHD classiﬁcation based on each single VSWM task
Notably, the four signiﬁcant PCs encompassed in the ADHD model
are based on fMRI data from all four VSWM tasks: PC-2 is based on
the two tasks without feedback; PC-3 is based on the small-reward
with feedback task; PC-4 is based on the large-reward with feedback
task; and PC-8 is based on the small-reward with feedback task
(Fig. 2). In the following analysis, we further investigated the utility of
using fMRI data from multiple VSWM tasks as compared with using
fMRI data from a single task. Here we used the threshold of eigenvalue
larger than one (keeping PCs that together explained more than 70%
of the variance in the data).
ADHD classiﬁcation accuracies based on the fMRI data from each
single task (Fig. 4; Table 1) were signiﬁcantly lower than the classiﬁcation accuracy of the model based on all four tasks (Fig. 3). The exception
was the classiﬁcation accuracy based on the fMRI data from the
small-reward with feedback task, which was 80%. However, here the
correct decisive classiﬁcation accuracy (with PP b0.33 or PP N0.67)
based on the fMRI data from the small-reward with feedback VSWM
task was 60%, which is signiﬁcantly lower (17.5%) than the four-task
classiﬁcation accuracy, p b 0.05 (one-tailed Fisher exact test).
3.3. ADHD classiﬁcation based on behavioral data
Feeding the LR classiﬁer with the behavioral data from all four tasks
resulted in an overall accuracy level of 75% (70% sensitivity; 80% speciﬁcity; omnibus test for model ﬁt, χ2(4) = 12.37, p b 0.01). This overall
accuracy level is signiﬁcantly lower (17.5%) than the accuracy based

on the fMRI data from the four tasks, p b 0.04 (one-tailed Fisher exact
test; testing the hypothesis “fMRI model is better than the behavioral
model”). Moreover, here only 57.5% of the classiﬁcation decisions
were both accurate and decisive, with high predicted probability values
of being a boy with ADHD (PP N 0.67) assigned to only 50% of the ADHD
boys, and low values (PP b 0.33) assigned to only 65% of the TD boys
(Fig. 5B). This accuracy level is signiﬁcantly lower (20%) than the decisive classiﬁcation accuracy based on the four signiﬁcant PCs (based on
four tasks), p b 0.04 (one-tailed Fisher exact test).
Performance levels in the four tasks were highly correlated, where a
boy that exhibited low performance in one task likely exhibited low
performance in the other tasks. Moreover, we found high correlations
between the behavioral performances in the four VSWM tasks and
PC-2 (Fig. 5C). That is, the brain activity represented by PC-2 (right
and left MFG, tasks without feedback) explains much of the observed
variability in the behavioral data. On the other hand, the behavioral
performances had low correlations with PC-3, PC-4 and PC-8, hence
the additional diagnostic information provided by these PCs to the
classiﬁcation model. Feeding the LR classiﬁer with both the behavioral
and fMRI data (10 PCs) resulted in exactly the same model as when
feeding it with only the fMRI data.
4. Discussion
4.1. Summary
We show that using a logistic regression (LR) classiﬁer, which
received as input brain imaging data that was acquired while children
perform four distinct VSWM tasks, enabled an ADHD classiﬁcation
accuracy of 92.5% (Fig. 3). Classiﬁcation accuracies that were based on
the fMRI data from all four tasks were signiﬁcantly higher than those
obtained using the fMRI data from any single task. We found that the
brain regions in which boys with ADHD exhibited altered pattern of
brain activity differed from one task to the other. The corresponding
behavioral data from the four VSWM tasks enabled an classiﬁcation

Participants who were misclassiﬁed based on the data from one
VSWM task were not necessarily misclassiﬁed when using the data
from other VSWM tasks (Fig. 4). When the LR classiﬁer was fed with
the PCs calculated based on the four VSWM tasks together, we observed
a substantial improvement in the classiﬁcation accuracy (Fig. 3). This is
consistent with the underlying theorem of ensemble-based classiﬁcation (Rokach, 2010; Klöppel et al., 2012). As expected based on this
theorem, classifying participants by using several measurements for
each participant (e.g., fMRI data from few distinct VSWM tasks),
where each measurement enables a better than chance classiﬁcation
accuracy, and where there is a substantial degree of independency between the measurements (e.g., distinct cognitive tasks), enabled higher
classiﬁcation accuracies compared to accuracies achieved by using the
data from each single measurement.

4.2. Theoretical contribution
Our ﬁndings are with important theoretical contribution, providing
additional support to the idea that the manifestation of neurocognitive
abnormalities in ADHD is context dependent (Dovis et al., 2013;
Hammer et al., 2015). Speciﬁcally, in the absence of trial-by-trial feedback, altered activity patterns characterizing ADHD were most evident
in the bilateral middle frontal gyri (MFG), speciﬁcally the right-MFG
(see PC-2 weight in Fig. 3; see feature weights in Fig. 2B). The MFG is
believed to play an executive role in the visuospatial working memory
network, and a primary role in volitional (top-down) allocation of
attention (Burgess et al., 2010; Ehlis et al., 2008; Vance et al., 2007).
We found that in VSWM tasks without feedback, boys with ADHD
exhibited lower levels of activity in the MFG as compared with TD
boys. This may indicate poor VSWM and poor capacity in allocating
attention to target stimuli in children with ADHD, manifested when
feedback is absent (see Cortese et al., 2012; Fassbender et al., 2011 for
related ﬁndings).

The fMRI data from the small-reward with feedback VSWM task also
had a considerable contribution to ADHD classiﬁcation (PC-8 and PC-3;
Fig. 3; Fig. 4B). Here, boys with ADHD exhibited altered brain activity in
a network (PC-8) that primarily included the bilateral orbitofrontal
cortex (bi-OFC) and the left fusiform gyrus (left-FFG). The OFC has
been reported to play two primary roles that have potential relevance
to the current task: Together with the inferior frontal gyrus, the anterior
insula, the superior temporal cortex and the temporoparietal junction,
the OFC is part of the ventral attention network, acting as a bottom-up
saliency detection system determining subjective and contextdependent susceptibility to unexpected salient stimuli (Corbetta et al.,
2008; Vossel et al., 2014; Weissman and Prado, 2012). The OFC was
also found to be involved in the processing of reward-related information (Schoenbaum and Roesch, 2005; Pauli et al., 2012). It is suggested
that the OFC is involved in monitoring which recent actions were
rewarded, and predicting which future actions are most likely to be
rewarded (Kahnt et al., 2010). The left-FFG was found to be involved in
letter identiﬁcation and reading (McCandliss et al., 2003; Dehaene and
Cohen, 2011; McNorgan et al., 2013). Here we found greater deactivation
in these two brain regions in TD boys, as compared to boys with ADHD,
primarily in the small-reward with feedback VSWM task. This may indicate that boys with ADHD fail in suppressing task irrelevant information
(letter identity in a task that requires monitoring the spatial location of
letters, and visual feedback indicating insigniﬁcant reward).
The features with signiﬁcant loadings on PC-3 (small-reward with
feedback) were the two fROIs in the right medial/superior prefrontal
gyrus (right-MeFG- and right-MeFG+, Fig. 2B), the left-MFG, the
right superior temporal gyrus (right-STG), the right anterior insula
(right-AntIns), and the right supramarginal gyrus. These brain regions
are involved in feedback processing (Ferdinand and Opitz, 2014),
bottom-up attention and in sensory integration (Prado et al., 2011;
Weissman and Prado, 2012). The loadings on PC-3 (and PC-8), indicate
that in the small-reward with feedback condition children with ADHD
are likely to exhibit altered suppression of irrelevant visual features

(FFG), altered visuospatial processing (precuneus), altered sensory
integration (STG and supramarginal), altered bottom-up attention control (OFC), altered feedback processing and top-down attention control
(MeFG and MFG), and altered synchronization between bottom-up and
top-down attention control (AntIns).
The fMRI data from the large-reward with feedback VSWM task had
the smallest contribution to ADHD classiﬁcation (57.5% accuracy, with
only a trend toward a signiﬁcant model ﬁt; Fig. 4B). Altered activity in
ADHD in this VSWM task was evident in PC-4 (Fig. 3), which included
the right inferior parietal lobe (right-IPL), the right-AntIns, the
right-MeFG (the activated right-MeFG fROI; see Fig. 2) and the right
precuneus. These fROIs partially overlap (right-AntIns and rightMeFG) with those included in PC-3 (small-reward with feedback).
This implies that the right-AntIns and right-MeFG are associated with
altered feedback processing in ADHD (regardless of reward expectation). This is consistent with earlier ﬁndings showing that the
right-AntIns and the right-MeFG (together with the anterior cingulate)
mediate between the central executive network and brain regions
involved in risk/gain prediction, where response selection is required
(Menon and Udin, 2010; Preuschoff et al., 2008; Späti et al., 2014;
Taylor et al., 2009). Early studies showed that children with ADHD
exhibit poor cognitive control associated with lower levels of neural
activity in the anterior insula, as compared with TDs (Cubillo et al.,
2010; Morein-Zamir et al., 2014).

classiﬁcation methods. Future studies should speciﬁcally explore
machine-learning methods based on whole brain data, from multiple
tasks, which automatically detect brain regions in which the targeted
clinical population exhibits abnormal patterns of brain activity
(e.g., Ryali et al., 2010).
4.4. Conclusions
We show that fMRI data acquired while participants perform a few
distinct cognitive tasks enables substantial improvement in the detection of ADHD cases, as compared with the use of fMRI data from a single
task (or corresponding behavioral data). Showing that fMRI data enables better classiﬁcation accuracies than the corresponding behavioral
data suggests that even ADHD cases that exhibited normal-like VSWM
performance were likely to be characterized by substantially altered
pattern of brain activation. This provides a proof-of-concept that
scanning subjects while they perform an ensemble of distinct cognitive
tasks is likely to payoff, enabling greater accuracies and higher conﬁdence diagnosis of clinical cases. We suggest that this approach can be
used for diagnosing other clinical populations, and possibly also for dissociating between distinct clinical populations who share behavioral
symptoms. This would require using cognitive tasks that target the
neurocognitive deﬁcits characterizing the clinical condition of interest,
or a battery of tasks that may enable dissociating between distinct
neurocognitive abnormalities.

4.3. Limitations and future research
We show that using fMRI data from four distinct VSWM tasks
enabled substantially better classiﬁcation accuracies than the use of
fMRI data from a single VSWM task. Nevertheless, the current investigation was limited to the manipulation of feedback and reward in VSWM
tasks, where many characteristics of the four tasks were identical. It is
possible that an even better ADHD classiﬁcation can be achieved by
using other, perhaps more demanding cognitive tasks that require
other cognitive skills impaired in ADHD (e.g., tasks with speciﬁcally
greater response inhibition demands; Booth et al., 2005; Rubia et al.,
2005). Moreover, the duration of each VSWM task we used here was
48 trials long (~100 s). It is possible that these tasks can be shortened
(e.g., reduced to 32, or even fewer trials) without compromising
classiﬁcation accuracies. As part of the development of a practical
diagnosis tool, future investigations should aim to identify an optimized
ensemble of cognitive tasks that would yield the highest classiﬁcation
accuracies in the shortest scanning time possible. This would enable
reducing scanning costs and potential discomfort to the scanned
subjects. Future investigation may also involve looking for an ensemble
of tasks that enable differentiation between children with ADHD
from other clinical populations, with shared symptoms. The use of
multi-task-based fMRI data may also enable earlier diagnosis of ADHD,
prior to the onset of clear behavioral symptoms, which in turn may
enable earlier intervention.
In order to be of practical clinical use, task-based fMRI diagnosis requires the scanned participants to accurately perform a cognitive task
while keeping still throughout a relatively long scan. Thus, a multitask-based fMRI diagnosis session may not be practical for very young
children or individuals with severe cognitive deﬁcits. However, mild
ADHD and moderate ADHD are much more common and represents
more of a diagnostic dilemma for clinicians. In contrast, severe or very
early onset ADHD would likely have a more distinct etiology. Future developments should ideally involve an integrative use of multi-taskbased fMRI, resting-state fMRI and structural imaging. This would likely
enable an effective diagnosis of most clinical cases, and the detection of
the onset of some clinical condition in early childhood. Ideally, future
imaging-based diagnostic tools may enable ﬁner differentiation of
ADHD subgroups, assisting clinicians in customizing intervention.
It is likely that similarly high (or even higher) classiﬁcation
accuracies can be achieved by using other machine-learning based
