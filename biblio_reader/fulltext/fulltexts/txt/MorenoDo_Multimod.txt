Introduction

Methods

The frontal lobe poses substantial challenges for establishing meaningful subdivisions. Nonetheless, the availability of several non-invasive large-scale datasets offers
the possibility for multimodal description of the convergence of parcels. Structural connectivity, measured
in-vivo in humans through diffusion-MRI (dMRI), characterizes the potential for information exchange between
different regions, while functional (fMRI) connectivity,
measured by correlated changes in the intrinsic BOLD
activity has been demonstrated to be highly consistent
with task coactivation literature. These modalities are related and partially complementary but not completely
overlapping. While they have shown positive correlations [1] some recent studies have come to challenge
long-held assumptions about the nature of brain connectivity [2]. Contrasting the information obtained from
these three modalities is therefore an important step towards characterizing and deepening the understanding
of brain organization within complex regions. Here we
compare maps obtained within the frontal lobe from
both dMRI tractography similarity matrices and correlation of fMRI time series from the NKI Enhanced Rockland
Sample [3], as well as the coactivation maps derived
from the NeuroSynth database [4].

• fMRI and dMRI (50 subjects) data from the NKI E. R. sample: structural (MPRAGE, TR=1900ms, 1mm voxel); three restingstate scans (BOLD EPI: TR=2500ms, 3mm voxel, 5’ duration; TR=1400ms, 2mm voxel, 10‘ min; TR=645ns, 3mm voxel, 10’)
and diffusion (TR=2400ms, TE=85ms, Multi-band accel.=4, 137 directions, 2mm voxel, b=1500 s/mm², 5’ duration).
• Resting-state fMRI datasets were aligned, bandpass-filtered, and motion-corrected with Nipype-mediated pipelines
[5]. MNI-registered, non-smoothed rs-fMRI data was sampled to FreeSurfer’s fsaverage5 surface template. r-values
were Fisher’s z-transformed and averaged across runs. Post-processing methods were adopted from Kelly et al [6].
• MRtrix was used to obtain spherical deconvolution based tractography from each voxel in the WM/GM interface to the
whole WM as target area, then the similarity between all pairs of tracts was computed as non-centered correlation [7].
The resulting matrix was also projected to the fsaverage5 surface.
• Task-based fMRI meta-analytic data from NeuroSynth was used for the co-activation meta-analysis. Co-activation maps
were extracted based on the correlation between the presence of activation at that vertex, and every other vertex of
the brain [8] (https://github.com/r03ert0/cmtool).
• The individual matrices from all three modalities were clustered into distinct regions using k-means and spectral clustering algorithms from scikit-learn toolbox [9], as well as averaged matrices across subjects. Individual partitions for
each cluster number solution were compiled across subjects using a consensus measure and then reclustered.

Discussion
Clustered cortical parcellations offer a medium for comparing the different methods for characterizing the
connectome. By integrating neuroimaging software
via Nipype, we have written a modular pipeline used to
cluster subregions of the frontal lobe. The pipeline allows
us to explore various combinations of analytic and preprocessing strategies, and offers the possibility of flexible
investigation of cortical parcellation across modalities
and datasets.
