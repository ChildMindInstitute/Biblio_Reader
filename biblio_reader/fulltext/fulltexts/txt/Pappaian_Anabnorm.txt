Abstract
Autism is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by poor social abilities, communication deficiency and
restricted behavioural patterns. Recently, scholars started to consider the possibility of detecting biological markers
for better and faster diagnosing autism. This problem has been approached from different perspectives considering
biochemical, neurophysiological, and neuroanatomical markers. Following this perspective, our intent was to
investigate whether a structural brain signature of autism can be detected in children by using a whole brain
morphological analysis. To this aim, we selected 43 male children with autistic spectrum disorder and 46 male
controls, matched for age. Structural brain images (T1 image), intelligence scores (Full IQ, Verbal IQ, Performance
IQ), and Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS) scores were considered for analyses. Source-Based
Morphometry, a multivariate method based on Independent Component Analysis to detect maximally independent
cortical networks of gray matter differences was applied to autistic and control brains. Results showed a statistically
different network between ASD children and controls, including several cerebellar regions (Inferior Semi-lunar
lobule, Tuble, Uvula, Pyramis, Declive, Cerebellar Tonsil) and the Fusiform Gyrus, confirming, but, also expanding
previous results. In addition, separate temporal, frontal, and parietal networks were found to be significantly
correlated with the Stereotyped Behaviour ADOS scores. These morphologic differences may be particularly useful
in paving the way for future objective methods to diagnose autism.

Introduction
Kanner defined autism as a disease characterized by three main
deficits: poverty of social relations, communication deficiency and
behavioural stereotypy with restricted interests. Recently, the
Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition
(DSM 5, 2013), included the diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder
(ASD) inside the neurodevelopmental disorders, building on the fact
that this pathology seems to have a neurobiological substrate. Indeed,
scientific research provided growing evidence that autism may be
associated with specific neurological and biological markers. One day
such biomarkers could help clinicians making earlier and more
objective diagnosis. In fact, autism is characterized by a large
heterogenity of symptomatic and phenotypical manifestations that
make a diagnosis based on observable signs very difficult [1-3].
Moreover, very often these signs appear at a late stage. The timing of
the diagnosis of autism is fundamental. According to Lord and
colleagues, autism could be diagnosed from about 18 months of age
[4,5]. However, in the vast majority of cases such diagnosis is not done
before of an age of 5-6 years, and this is probably due to the lack of
objective markers. Earlier detection of autism can lead to better
responses to interventions [5,6]. Recently there is a growing interest
among clinicians and scholars to find the possibility of isolating
objective biological markers for autism [6,7]. The problem has been
approached from different perspectives: behavioral, biochemical,
neuroanatomical, neurophysiological, immunological, and even

hormonal. While some biochemical biomarkers have been clearly
identified, research is now focused on the possibility of finding genetic,
metabolic and neurological markers [8]. About the neurological
markers, some encouraging data is emerging. For example, Bosl et al.
[9], showed abnormal EEG patterns in babies between 6 and 24
months with histories of autism in family. Authors suggest these
patterns may point out a functional endophenotype related to ASD
risk. In another study, researchers investigated plasticity in motor
cortex under a low-intensity repetitive transcranical magnetic
stimulation (rTMS) in young ASD. The results showed a greater
reduction in the amplitude of motor evoked potentials in the diseased
group compared to those of typical controls 20 min after stimulation
[10]. This result may indicate a marker of cortical plasticity to be used
in the diagnosis of autism [10]. Functional and structural magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI) studies, described a series of abnormalities
in the autistic brain. Among others, differences were found in the
cerebellum (abnormal grey matter thickness compared to typical
subjects), in the amygdala (abnormal constant activation in the first
years), larger right volume of amygdala associated with difficulties and
criticality in social and communication [2,8,11,12]. More recently,
Hyde et al. [11] found several brain regions differences in grey matter
between autistic and control individuals: the Inferior Frontal Cortex,
Superior Temporal Sulcus, Cingulate Gyrus, Middle Occipital Gyrus,
Fusiform Gyrus, and Inferior Parietal Lobule.
One problem with these results was that no whole brain analyses
where carried out, thus resulting in partial and puzzling findings. Only
recently, Grecucci and colleagues (in prep) used a novel approach to
structural MRI data analysis called Source-Based Morphometry
(SBM), that is a multivariate method to detect activation patterns of

gray matter distributed over several large and independent cortical
components [13,14]. With this methodology, Grecucci found
abnormalities in large temporal, frontal and cerebellar networks in
adult autistics (age 18-39) as compared with controls [13].
Building from Grecucci’s work, our intent was to extend the
previous results to younger autistic individuals using the same whole
brain approach. The relevance of the present study stems from the fact
that if these markers are visible at a younger age, they may be used in
the near future by clinicians to diagnose autism at an earlier stage.

Methods
43 male subjects with autistic spectrum disorder (mean age=9.84;
SD=1.24) and 46 male controls (mean age=10.03; SD=1.38), were
selected from Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE)
database. Since our interest in the present study was on children, the
age of the samples ranged between 6 and 12 years old. We considered

only subjects with no artifactual MRI images and complete cognitive
tests scores. Beside structural magnetic resonance images (T1 image),
intelligence scores (Full IQ, Verbal IQ, Performance IQ) derived from
the Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence (WASI), the Differential
Ability Scales (DAS), and the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children
(WISC) were considered. In addition, we considered the Autism
Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS) scoring for autistic sample
(specifically Social, Communication and Repetitive Behavior scores)
only for the ASD group. All demographic informations are presented
in Table 1. Data were chosen from four different research centers,
including NYU Langone Medical Center, University of California in
Los Angeles, Yale Child Study Center, School of Medicine in University
of Pittsburg. The scanners were used from the same manufacturer (e.g.
3T Siemens TrioTim, Siemens Allegra). All information is available on

SBM, a multivariate approach useful to identify automatic voxels
composition or activation pattern in the brain, was applied to
structural images. Although often used with functional data, an
independent component analysis approach applied to structural data
can be very useful in identifying grey matter patterns in a whole brain

software
(http://
www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/software) and dedicated toolboxes were
used. After the initial check of data quality (in order to avoid critical
artefacts as head-motion effect, ghosting, stripes that could potentially
affect the results), images were segmented in grey matter, white matter
and cerebrospinal fluid. Following Ashburner and Friston [15],
alignment and normalization to MNI space with smoothing (fullwidth at half maximum of Gaussian smoothing kernel [8, 8, 8]) was
then applied. After pre-processing, images were ready to be analyzed
with SBM. In order to implement SBM, Independent Component
Analysis (ICA) was applied. ICA breaks up the mixed signal coming
from images of both groups together, recognizing maximally spatially
independent sources revealing patterns of variation that occur in

structural MRI images automatically. GIFT software (http://
mialab.mrn.org/software/gift) was used to compute ICA applying
Infomax algorithm with ICASSO method [16,17]. We then performed
two sample t-test on loading scores to identify sMRI differences
between the two groups for every component. Moreover, we looked for
correlations between components and cognitive tests’ scores (in
addition to ADOS scores for autistic children).

Results
No differences were found in age (t(88)=1.98, p=0.335), Full IQ
(t(88)=1.98, p=0.410), or Performance IQ (t(88)=1.99, p=0.280)
between groups. Only Verbal IQ resulted significantly different
between groups (t(88)=1.98, p=0.012). Verbal and language difficulties
characterizing autistic spectrum legitimize this diversity in the two
samples. ICA returned 16 Independent Components (Figure 1).
Notably the number of components to look for was suggested by the
GIFT toolbox based the well-known Akaike’s information criterion
and not selected based on a priori knowledge.

Only IC2 resulted to be significantly differed between groups
(p=0.0493*). This network included several cerebellar regions: Tuber,
Pyramis, Inferior Semi-Lunar Lobule showed the widest extension at
the cortical level, but also a small portion of the right Fusiform Gyrus.
Although essentially bilateral, these activations resulted a bit more
intense on the right hemisphere (Figure 2). Specific details about IC2’s
composition are available in Table 2.

voxels above the threshold of |Z|>2.5 are shown.
ICA returned other interesting components that showed mild
statistical trends between groups. In particular, IC6 (p=0.0794) showed
differences again in cerebellar regions such as: Inferior-Semi Lunar
Lobule and Cerebellar Tonsil, bilaterally. This confirms the role of
Cerebellum as a crucial region for autism, confirming previous results
with older ASD individuals [13]. IC8 (p=0.0781), showed differences in
the left Middle Temporal Gyrus, Superior Temporal Gyrus, Insula and
Inferior Temporal Gyrus. Figure 1 for graphical details of these
components.
We also checked for correlations with IQ and ADOS scores. We
found a positive correlation (r=0.3820; p=0.0115) between IC5 (that
includes Insula, Superior Temporal Gyrus, Inferior Frontal Gyrus,
Extra-Nuclear, Inferior Temporal Gyrus, Middle Temporal Gyrus, SubGyral, Fusiform Gyrus), and Stereotyped Behavior ADOS score.

Discussion
In this study, we used Source-Based Morphometry to investigate the
presence of abnormal neural circuits in children with autistic spectrum
disorder (age 6-12) compared with typical development peers. T1 MRI
images of 89 male subjects (43 diseased and 46 control subjects) from
ABIDE online database were considered [18]. SBM, a multivariate
approach was used to study grey matter differences between samples
[14]. This method is based on the detection and decomposition of
mixed signal coming from structural images by the Independent
Components Analysis (ICA). Because of that, SBM is a powerful tool
to detect dissimilarities in gray matter between subjects not in terms of
regions of interest (as in other type of analysis like Voxel-Based
Morphometry), but in terms of different networks. This data-driven
approach allows us to make a wide-ranging reasoning not being
anchored to regions of interest pre-selected before the analysis. Indeed,
ICA works autonomously on the entire brain. There is no theory that

guides the analysis, rather, theory follows the analysis. This is a great
advantage as compared to standard analyses (such as Voxel-based
Morphometry) used in previous studies. In this way, a data-driven
method is able to provide a way to gather signal information from
different voxels so as to identify unpredictable patterns [14]. Results
showed a significantly different independent component (IC2)
between groups. IC2 included a large network in the cerebellum,
bilaterally. The involvement of the cerebellum as a neural region
involved in autism is not new. As already mentioned, Amaral et al.
considered cerebellum as compromised in autism: in post-mortem
studies, the 79% of examined autistics’ cerebellums showed a lower
density of Purkinje cells [19-22]. In their review paper, authors pointed
out that cerebellum may be generally larger in autistic than healthy
people, although this difference can be justified by the stated increase
in brain volume typical for this disorder [23,24]. There is evidence on
the involvement of cerebellum in many cognitive functions, as it is
widely interconnectioned with the thalamus and with several cortical
regions [25-27]. Nowadays, cerebellum is strongly considered engaged
in an umbrella of cognitive functions such as language, auditory
processing, visuospatial perception, verbal memory, sequencing and
executive functions [25,27,28]. In light of these evidences, we may
hypothesize that cerebellar network found in our autistic sample could
be directly involved in the phenotypic and symptomatic manifestations
of this disorder. Although we did not find any correlation between IC2
and IQ nor ADOS scores, a recent study showed that cerebellar deficits
correlated with social and communication deficits and stereotyped
behaviour [29]. In the same study, grey matter volume in Right Crus
I/II of cerebellar regions resulted to be smaller than in controls, and
predicted the impaired performance in ADOS test. Authors found also
differences between groups in several cerebellar parts as right Crus 1/2,
Vermis VIIIA, Vermis VIIIB, Vermis VIIIB, Vermis IV and others [29].
We also found a second cerebellar network (IC6), including the
Inferior Semi-Lunar Lobule and the Cerebellar Tonsil, that showed a
trend toward significance further confirming the role of cerebellar
regions in autism. IC8, that included wide left temporal circuit with
additional small areas in frontal, occipital and parietal lobes showed
again a trend. Notably, a similar temporal-frontal circuit was found by
Grecucci et al. [13] (in prep) with older ASD individuals, thus
confirming the role of wide cortical networks in ASD pathophysiology,
and the importance of a distributed whole brain approach when
studying autism. Finally, we found an interesting correlation between a
fronto-temporal network (IC5, including the right Insula, Superior
Temporal Gyrus, Inferior Frontal Gyrus, Extra-Nuclear, Inferior
Temporal Gyrus, Middle Temporal Gyrus, Sub-Gyral, Fusiform
Gyrus), and ADOS Stereotype Behaviour scores [13]. This large
network may integrate emotional aspects (limbic areas as insula in
temporal lobe) with planning and organizational ones (frontal
regions), deficitary in individuals suffering from ASD. One hypothesis
is that large networks of areas contribute to social and behavioral
deficits displayed by ASD individuals and the need for a more global
approach when studying this pathology.
Although these results can be considered as preliminary, they clearly
stress the importance of the cerebellum as a key region for
understanding ASD. We expanded previous results by showing that
abnormalities in this region appear earlier than showed in previous
studies with older ASD individuals [13]. Future studies will explore the
functional aspects of this region and how it is specifically associated
with the deficits presented by autistics. Moreover, we provided
evidence of the usefulness of a whole brain approach such as SBM as
compared to previous region specific approaches.
