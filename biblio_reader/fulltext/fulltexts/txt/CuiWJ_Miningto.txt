ABSTRACT. Compared to other placental mammals, humans have unique
thinking and cognitive abilities because of their developed cerebral cortex
composed of billions of neurons and synaptic connections. As the primary
effectors of the mechanisms of life, proteins and their interactions form the
basis of cellular and molecular functions in the living body. In this paper, we
developed a pipeline for mining topological structures, identifying functional
modules, and analyzing their functions from publically available datasets. A
human brain-specific protein-protein interaction network with 1482 nodes
and 3105 edges was built using a MapReduce based shortest path algorithm.
Within this, 7 functional cliques were identified using a network clustering
method, 98 hub proteins were obtained by the calculation of betweenness
and connectivity, and 5 closest relationship to clique connector proteins
were recognized by the combination scores of topological distance and
gene ontology similarity. Furthermore, we discovered functional modules
interacting with TP53 protein, which involves several fragmented research
study conclusions and might be an important clue for further in vivo or in
silico experiments to confirm these associations.

INTRODUCTION
During the process of gene expression in the human brain, from transcription to translation,
any critical change will lead to a change in the physiology and behavior of a neuron. Numerous
research efforts have attempted to disclose the working mechanisms of the brain both from the
viewpoint of physiological structure using imaging technologies (Amunts et al., 2014; Di Martino et
al., 2014) and that of gene expression using genome-wide association studies (Hernandez et al.,
2012; Medland et al., 2014).
System biology and biological interaction networks have led to new paradigms in these
analyses. The discovery of the key changes in genes or proteins that regulate the responses of the
brain to external stimuli or lead to neuropsychiatric disorders can accelerate the pace of gene and
drug treatments. Protein interaction is crucial for building the networks in the brain that underlie
these phenomena (Amunts et al., 2014). Neural networks are formed by the interconnection of
specific neurons in the brain. The molecular mechanisms involved in creating these connections,
however, are poorly understood (Zilles and Amunts, 2013).
In this paper, we developed a pipeline for mining topological structures, identifying
functional modules, and analyzing their functions. A human brain-specific protein-protein interaction
network (PPIN) with 1482 nodes and 3105 edges was built using a MapReduce-based shortest
path algorithm. Within this, 7 functional modules were identified using the molecular complex
detection (Mcode) algorithm (Bader and Hogue, 2003), 98 hub proteins were obtained by the
calculation of betweenness and connectivity, and 5 closest relationship to clique connector (CRCC)
proteins were recognized by the combination of scores of topological distance and gene ontology
(GO) similarity. Furthermore, we discovered functional modules interacting with the TP53 protein,
which involves several fragmented research study conclusions, and might be an import clue for
further in vivo or in silico experiments to confirm or build upon these associations.

MATERIAL AND METHODS
PPI network construction for human brain-specific genes
Gene expression datasets such as those from the Genomics Institute of the Novartis
Research Foundation, serial analysis of gene expression, and expressed sequence tags are
very widely used as data sources for classifying housekeeping (HK) and tissue-specific (TS)
genes. For a given gene, applying predefined thresholds of its expression levels usually allows
its identification as HK or TS. However, because of the noise contained in expression datasets
and human involvement in defining the thresholds, the reliability of the identifications is often not
high. In this paper, we attempted to rectify this problem by obtaining brain-specific genes from two
sources: scientific publications from PubMed and known tissue-specific databases such as TisGeD
(Xiao et al., 2010) and TiGER (Liu et al., 2008). From this, we finally obtained a total of 56 brain
tissue-specific genes.
Tissue-specific genes generally exhibit high expression in the corresponding tissue
of living organisms. The external environment, which is primarily reflected in the transcription
and expression of non-specific-tissue genes, exerts a considerable influence in the process of
biological regulation. Proteins encoded by tissue-specific genes are instead greatly influenced
by their associated proteins. To examine these for the brain, we developed a MapReduceGenetics and Molecular Research 14 (4): 12437-12445 (2015)

based Dijkstra shortest path algorithm (cloudSPA) to extract associated proteins from the whole
human PPI data repository (http://string-db.org/), and then constructed a highly-associated
PPIN.
A PPIN can be represented as an undirected weighted graph. Nodes represent proteins,
edges denote interactions between proteins, and weights indicate the tightness of such interactions.
To construct the brain-specific PPIN, firstly, we constructed a PPIN G0≤ N0, E0, W0 >, in which N0
represented the tissue specific protein set, E0 was the interaction set of proteins in N0, and W0 was
the associated strength set of interactions in E0.
Secondly, on the basis of the G0, the full human PPI was partitioned into several PPINs.
Then, we queried the strong correlation paths between tissue-specific proteins in these networks
using cloudSPA. All strong correlation paths were retrieved and added into G0 to construct a PPIN
G1≤ N1, E1, W1 >, which still contained many redundancy connections. Thirdly, we discarded those
non-shortest paths (non-strong-correlation paths) between tissue-specific proteins in G1, and
finally constructed a PPIN G2≤ N2, E2, W2 > (tissue specific PPIN), which was a PPIN with strong
correlations and few redundancies of data.

Identifying date hub proteins
Hub proteins and functional modules are usually regarded as two key players in a PPIN.
Joy et al. (2005) pointed out that the hub proteins might act as important links between these
modules. Interactions between these topological structures play an important role in maintaining
the steady state of life systems.
A date hub represents a protein with high connectivity and low co-expression. The terms
degree and betweenness are used to describe a date hub. For every node v in a PPIN, degree
centrality (DC) is defined as in Equation 1:

(Equation 1)

where deg(v) = {e| e∈E ⋀v∈V} is the number of links for node v.
Betweenness assesses the number of shortest paths passing through a given node. The
concept derives from the analysis of social networks. A node with high betweenness centrality is
more likely to be located on the shortest paths between multiple node pairs in the network and
therefore more information should be passed through it. This means that betweenness centrality
will easily lead to congestion and be more likely to become the bottleneck of a network. For every
node v, betweenness centrality is defined as in Equation 2:

(Equation 2)

where σ(s, t) is the number of shortest paths from s to t; and σ(s, t│ v) is the number of shortest
paths passing through v from s to t.

Essential genes are those indispensable for the survival of an organism, and their functions
are therefore considered a foundation of life. Date hub proteins are identified by the proportion of
proteins encoded by essential genes.
Proteins in a PPIN are divided into four groups: high betweenness, high connectivity; low
betweenness, high connectivity; high betweenness, low connectivity, and low betweenness; low
connectivity.
Here, we used a threshold α to describe whether a protein was high connectivity and low
co-expression (high betweenness). The best α is chosen when the proportion of proteins encoded
by essential genes is the largest, as shown in Figure 1.

Figure 1. Identification of date hub proteins. The y-axis represents the proportion of proteins encoded by essential
genes and the x-axis reflects the threshold, when α = 0.12, that the proportion of proteins encoded by essential genes
is the largest. HBHC, high betweenness, high connectivity; LBHC, low betweenness, high connectivity; HBLC, high
betweenness, low connectivity; LBLC, low betweenness, low connectivity.

Mining functional modules
Functional modules consist of proteins that participate in a particular cellular process while
binding each other at different times and places (Schwikowski et al., 2000; Spirin and Mirny, 2003).
Proteins inside a module have strong functional relevance. Cellular functions, such as signal
transmission, are carried out by “modules” made up of many species of interacting molecules
(Hartwell et al., 1999). Identifying functional modules is similar to detecting communities (clusters)
in a network. To date, there are many clustering algorithms developed to find such groups; for
instance, Mcode (Bader and Hogue, 2003), highly connected subgraph (Hartuv and Shamir, 1999),
and restricted neighborhood search clustering (King et al., 2004). We performed the clustering
analysis using above methods, and carried out functional enrichment analysis on the results. Only
the results that were generated using the Mcode algorithm demonstrated rich GO sets. Thus, we
adopted the Mcode algorithm to identify the functional modules in the PPIN.

Identification of CRCC proteins
Date hubs are considered to connect different modules. To obtain a better understanding
of the biological function of date hub proteins as key connectors in the PPIN, we combined the
topological distance and the GO similarity to measure the relationships as shown in Equation 3:
(Equation 3)
where TDS(V, C) is the score of topological distance, indicating the shortest distance from the
date hub to its corresponding modules. GSS(V, C) is the score of GO similarity. AvgTDS(C) and
AvgGSS(C) are the average topological and average GO similarity scores, respectively.

RESULTS
PPIN of human brain-specific genes
The final PPIN of human brain-specific genes is shown in Figure 2. It consists of 1482
nodes and 3105 edges. The features of its topological properties are shown in Table 1. From the
table, we can observe that the PPIN follows the law of a small-world network (Telesford et al.,
2011). The values of path length, centralization, and density indicate that the whole network is
quite sparse.

Functional modules
A total of 7 functional modules were identified (Table 2). We performed functional
enrichment analysis on those clusters, and all of them matched rich GO terms. For example, the
functions of cluster 1 primarily included metabolic processes such as the Wnt signaling pathway,
TGF-β signaling pathway, and ubiquitin mediated proteolysis. Functions of cluster 2 primarily
consisted of responses to external stimulation including the B cell receptor, Toll-like receptor, and
T cell receptor signaling pathways. Cluster 3 was found to mainly regulate biological processes; its
functions included the gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) signaling pathway and the calcium
signaling pathway. The function of cluster 4 was the regulation of cell protein metabolism. Cluster
5 played a significant role in immune response and immune regulation. The functions of cluster
6 primarily included RNA splicing, nuclear mRNA splicing via spliceosomes, and RNA splicing
via transesterification reactions. The functions of cluster 7 mainly included certain fundamental
cellular functions such as forebrain development, lymphocyte activation, adherent junctions, focal
adhesion, synaptic transmission, and positive regulation of cell communication.

conclusions (1-3) proposed in different papers as cited. Gray represents the function of the clusters. Blue indicates
the hub protein.

The protein encoded by TP53 (p53) acts as a tumor suppressor. The nuclear accumulation
and transcriptional activity of β-catenin has been shown to be modulated by p53, and the inhibition
of p53 expression can promote nuclear accumulation and the transcriptional activity of β-catenin
which affects the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) (Wang et al., 2013). Activation of p53
accelerates the degradation of β-catenin and then inhibits the Wnt signaling pathway (Zheng and
Xu, 2009). In turn, the Wnt signaling pathway induces EMT through inhibiting the degradation
of β-catenin in the cytoplasm as well as phosphorylation mediated by glycogen synthase kinase
(Gsk3β) (Giles et al., 2003). As mentioned previously, functions of cluster 1 include the Wnt
signaling pathway and functions of cluster 7 include some fundamental cellular functions such as
adherent junctions that are related to EMT. Obviously, the expression of TP53 affects the content
of β-catenin and further regulates these two functional modules.
Along the same lines, the CCNB1 gene encodes a cell cycle protein. Cluster 6 plays a role
in transcription and cluster 7 primarily comprises some basic cellular functions such as cell cycle
progression, gene expression regulation and transcriptional regulation. Thus, CCNB1 is clearly
closely related to these two modules.
The protein encoded by SMAD4 can serve as a tumor suppressor. SMAD directly
participates in signal transduction of the TGF-β superfamily and is an important mediator of
TGF-β superfamily members for their participation in life activities (Li et al., 2011). TAK1 was
originally identified as a mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase (MAP3K) activated by
TGF-β (Yamaguchi et al., 1995) and was characterized as a central player in multiple immune and
inflammatory signaling pathways including cytokine receptors, Toll-like receptor, T-cell receptor,

and B-cell receptor-mediated signaling (Sato et al., 2005; Schuman et al., 2009; Shinohara and
Kurosaki, 2009; Chen, 2012; Sakurai, 2012) (cluster 2). On the other hand, research by Scheel
et al. (2011) shows that TGF-β is able to induce EMT, which is closely related to the function of
adherent junctions and focal adhesion (cluster 7).
NDN is an imprinted gene and one of the many actions of Nhlh2 might be through necdin,
a downstream target of Nhlh2 that was shown to augment GnRH gene transcription by interrupting
Msx repression (Miller et al., 2009) (cluster 3). There are no obvious research results that illustrate
the relationship between NDN and cluster 7. However, cluster 7 mainly comprises some basic
cellular functions and many functions of NDN are inseparable from synaptic transmission, the
positive regulation of cell communication, and cell mobility (cluster 7).
The RPS16 gene encodes a ribosomal protein that is the main component of the ribosome,
which is essential in protein biosynthesis. Although we were unable to identify evidence to verify
the relationship between RPS16 and its corresponding clusters, we might predict that it plays a role
in the response to external stimuli and regulation of cell biological processes.

DISCUSSION
Hub proteins act as important links between functional modules. We can both verify
some relevant published conclusions and predict some as-yet unknown biological processes.
Meanwhile, some relevant conclusions can be integrated to describe a complete biological process
that is significant for understanding PPIN robustness and integrity. With the rapid development of
science and technology, increasing numbers of biological experiments can be completed efficiently.
If conclusions in these papers cannot be efficiently utilized and incorporated, that would be a
great loss. Therefore, the question of how to integrate them remains a challenging problem. Our
discovery might provide a clue to achieving this goal.
On the other hand, we note that the results of the enrichment analysis focus primarily on
basic functions and rarely contain brain tissue-specific functions. One reason for this might be that
the majority of brain function modules play a role in basic biological processes. Another reason could
be the small set of data currently known to be related because we are not very certain regarding the
mechanisms of cognition and thinking, and we intend to examine this issue further in future studies.
