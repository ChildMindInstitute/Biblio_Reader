In classical statistics, much thought has been put into experimental design and data collection.
In the high-dimensional setting, however, experimental design has been less of a focus. In this
paper, we stress the importance of collecting multiple replicates for each subject in this setting.
We consider learning the structure of a graphical model with latent variables, under the assumption that these variables take a constant value across replicates within each subject. By collecting
multiple replicates for each subject, we are able to estimate the conditional dependence relationships among the observed variables given the latent variables. To test the null hypothesis of
conditional independence between two observed variables, we propose a pairwise decorrelated
score test. Theoretical guarantees are established for parameter estimation and for this test. We
show that our proposal is able to estimate latent variable graphical models more accurately than
some existing proposals, and apply the proposed method to a brain imaging dataset.

1. I NTRODUCTION
Experimental design and data collection have been the subjects of extensive research (Box
et al., 2005; Montgomery, 2008). For instance, randomised clinical trials are conducted to determine the treatment effect of a new drug, and sample size calculations are performed to determine
the smallest number of patients needed to give sufficient power to detect the treatment effect. In

contrast, in the high-dimensional setting, statisticians are usually not involved in experimental
design and data collection. Given a cost constraint, investigators often try to obtain the largest
possible number of subjects; that is, replicates are typically not collected for each subject. In this
paper, we show that collecting replicates aids when learning an undirected graphical model with
latent variables.
In an undirected graphical model, each node represents a random variable, and an edge connecting a pair of nodes indicates that the two variables are conditionally dependent, given all
the other variables. The Gaussian graphical model has been studied extensively (Meinshausen &
Bühlmann, 2006; Yuan & Lin, 2007; Friedman et al., 2008; Rothman et al., 2008; Peng et al.,
2009; Ravikumar et al., 2011; Cai et al., 2011; Sun & Zhang, 2013). Other authors have considered extensions to the case in which each node-conditional distribution belongs to a univariate
exponential family (Ravikumar et al., 2010; Yang et al., 2015; Lee & Hastie, 2015; Chen et al.,
2015). Others have considered estimating conditional dependence relationships using semiparametric or nonparametric approaches (Liu et al., 2009, 2012; Fellinghauer et al., 2013; Voorman
et al., 2014).
However, in many scientific studies, we observe only a subset of the relevant variables. For
instance, in the context of a gene expression study, certain patients may have undiagnosed disease
or some unknown risk factors. If the heterogeneity among patients is ignored, then the estimated
conditional relationships among the genes may be distorted. This is made apparent in recent work
on Gaussian graphical modelling in the presence of latent variables (Chandrasekaran et al., 2012),
which showed that after marginalizing over the latent variables, the conditional independence
graph corresponding to the observed variables may be dense.
In this paper, we propose an estimator and develop theory for the semiparametric exponential
family graphical model with latent variables. This work builds upon an unpublished 2014 technical report by Yang et al. (arXiv:1412.8697), in which the semiparametric exponential family
graphical model was introduced. We assume that these variables are constant across replicates
within a given subject and that we have at least two replicates per subject. We exploit the replicates in order to construct a nuisance-free loss function that does not depend on the latent variables. In addition, we propose a pairwise decorrelated score test of the null hypothesis that two
variables are conditionally independent, given all the other variables.

2·1. Review of the semiparametric exponential family graphical model
We provide a brief review of the semiparametric exponential family graphical model proposed in Yang et al. (arXiv:1412:8697). Let X be a p-dimensional random vector and let
X−j = (X1 , . . . , Xj−1 , Xj+1 , . . . , Xp )T . The p-dimensional random vector X follows the semiparametric exponential family graphical model if, for any node j, the conditional density of Xj
given X−j satisfies

T
p(xj | x−j ) = exp xj βj,−j
x−j + fj (xj ) − Aj (βj , fj ) ,
(1)
where βj,−j encodes the conditional dependence relationships between the jth node and the
other nodes, fj (·) is an unknown function, and Aj (·) is the log-partition function. Because fj (·)
is unknown, obtaining the maximum likelihood estimator of (1) may be infeasible. To estimate
βj,−j , we can instead construct a loss function that does not depend on fj (·).
Let Xi and xi be the random variables and data corresponding to the ith subject, respectively.
(·)
Let x·j = (x1j , . . . , xnj )T , and let xj and z·j be the order and rank statistics of x·j , respec-

Latent variable graphical models

tively. For instance, if x·j = (1, 5, 2)T , then xj = (1, 2, 5)T and z·j = (1, 3, 2)T . Furthermore,
let x·,−j denote an n × (p − 1) matrix obtained by stacking the vectors x·k for k 6= j. The joint
conditional density of the jth variable given the others can be decomposed as
n
o n
o
(·)
(·)
p(x·j | x·,−j , βj,−j , fj ) = p z·j | x·,−j , xj , βj,−j p xj | x·,−j , βj,−j , fj ,
the product of the conditional density of the rank statistics given the order statistics, and the
density of the order statistics. The former does not depend on fj (·): the key insight is that the
rank statistics given the order statistics have no information about fj (·). Rather than estimating
βj,−j from the joint conditional density that involves the unknown function fj (·), we can estimate
βj,−j by maximising the conditional density of the rank statistics.
However, computing the conditional density of the rank statistics may be computationally
prohibitive. Thus, we can consider the conditional density formed by a single pair of samples,
and construct a nuisance-free likelihood function by multiplying the conditional densities of the
n(n − 1)/2 pairs of samples. This approach is also considered in Ning et al. (2016) in the context
of semiparametric regression.

variables, respectively.

where fj (xj ) is some possibly unknown function and Aj (βj , fj ) is the log-partition function.

jth node and all the other observed and latent variables, respectively. In particular, βjk = 0 if
and only if the jth and kth nodes are conditionally independent, given all the other nodes.

We provide two special cases of (2), and consider them in Section 4.

Example 1. The Gaussian graphical model with latent variables: let X = (XOT , XHT )T ∼
N (0, Σ), where Σ ∈ R(p+h)×(p+h) and let Θ = Σ−1 . For j ∈ O, the conditional density of Xj
given all the other variables is

2·3. From replicates to a nuisance-free loss function
Recall that we are interested in estimating the conditional dependence relationships among the
observed variables given the latent variables, βj,O\j . Due to the presence of the possibly unknown
function fj (xj ) and the latent variables xH in (2), it is not possible to directly maximise (2) with
respect to βj,O\j . By collecting multiple replicates per subject, and assuming that the latent
variables are constant across replicates for a given subject, we construct a loss function that does
not depend on the latent variables and the unknown function.
Let Ri be the number of replicates for the ith subject. To simplify bookkeeping, we assume that
R1 = · · · = Rn = R, though this assumption is not critical. Suppose that Xir , the random vector
for the rth replicate for the ith subject is distributed as in (3), for i = 1, . . . , n and r = 1, . . . , R.
0
Throughout the paper, we assume that Xir and Xir0 are independent, while Xir and Xir may be
dependent. Let xri = {(xriO )T , (xriH )T }T be the data corresponding to the rth replicate of the ith
subject. We make two assumptions on the replicates.
0

Assumption 1. The latent variables are constant across replicates, that is, xriH = xriH = xiH
for all 1 ≤ r0 ≤ r ≤ R.
Assumption 2. Given the
the R replicates are mutually independent. That is,
QRlatent variables,
1
R
r
p(xiO , . . . , xiO | xiH ) = r=1 p(xiO | xiH ).

Assumptions 1 and 2 are plausible in many scientific settings. For instance, consider a gene
expression study in which the expression levels of thousands of genes are measured for a number of subjects. Certain subjects may have unknown risk factors that might be associated with
their gene expression levels. In this setting, the observed variables are the genes, and the latent
variables represent unknown risk factors. Assumption 1 is satisfied if the disease status or the
unknown risk factors do not change across time. Assumption 2 is likely to be satisfied, if the
gene expression levels are measured in multiple independent clinical visits.
We now construct a nuisance-free loss function using an approach similar to the one outlined
in Section 2·1, by exploiting the fact that R replicates are available for each subject. Under

exponential family graphical model (Equation (3.1) in Yang et al. (arXiv:1412.8697)), both of

However, in the high-dimensional setting, the score test statistic is not asymptotically normal,

test to test the null hypothesis given in (8). The test is constructed so that the effect of the nuisance parameters is asymptotically negligible. The decorrelated score test has been previously
considered in Ning & Liu (2016), Ning et al. (2016), and Yang et al. (arXiv:1412.8697).

a symmetric matrix M ∈ Rd×d , we let kM k∞ = max1≤j,j 0 ≤d |Mjj 0 |. Also, let Λmin (M ) and
Λmax (M ) denote the minimum and maximum eigenvalues of M , respectively.

3·2. Parameter estimation
We provide an upper bound on the estimation error of β̂j,O\j obtained from solving (7). We
study the asymptotic regime in which both n and p are allowed to grow, with R and h fixed.
Proofs are deferred to the Supplementary Material. We first state an assumption on the first
moment of the random variables and the local smoothness of the log-partition function.

2009). We now establish upper bounds on the estimation error of β̂j,O\j .

Theorem 1 generalises Theorem 4.4 in Yang et al. (arXiv:1412.8697). Interestingly, we obtain
the same rate of convergence even when latent variables are present. Our rate of convergence

Latent variable graphical models

does not depend on the number of latent variables h. Theorem 1 holds with high probability
conditioned on the event A. For binary or categorical variables, A holds with M constant. In the
case of sub-exponential random variables, it can be shown that A holds with high probability,
with M = C log2 p for a sufficiently large constant C.
The upper bounds on the estimation error in Theorem 1 depend on the quantities κ2min , REmin ,
and ρq,min . These conditions can be bounded below by a positive constant when the random
variables follow a multivariate Gaussian distribution.

4. S IMULATION S TUDIES
4·1. Overview and competing proposals
∗ 6= 0 if and only if the jth and kth nodes are conditionally
Recall from Definition 1 that βjk
dependent, given all the other variables. To evaluate the performance across different methods,
we define the true positive rate as the proportion of correctly identified non-zeros, and the false
positive rate as the proportion of zeros that are incorrectly identified to be non-zeros. To examine
the finite-sample performance of the pairwise decorrelated score test, we test the null hypothesis
∗ = 0. The type I error and power are calculated as the proportion of falsely rejected H
H0 : βjk
0
and correctly rejected H0 , respectively.
Five approaches are compared in our simulation studies: our proposal; the low-rank plus
sparse latent variable Gaussian graphical model (Chandrasekaran et al., 2012); the semiparametric exponential family graphical model in Yang et al. (arXiv:1412.8697); the graphical lasso
(Friedman et al., 2008); and the neighbourhood selection procedure (Meinshausen & Bühlmann,
2006; Ravikumar et al., 2011). Our proposal, Meinshausen & Bühlmann (2006), Ravikumar et al.
(2011), and the semiparametric exponential family graphical model yield asymmetric estimates
of the edge set. To symmetrise the edge set, we consider both the intersection and union rules
described in Meinshausen & Bühlmann (2006), and report the best results for the competing
proposals. We report our results using only the union rule.
Since the competing methods cannot accommodate replicates, we apply them to all nR observations, treating the replicates as independent samples. Our proposal, Friedman et al. (2008),
Meinshausen & Bühlmann (2006), Ravikumar et al. (2011), and the semiparametric exponential

family graphical model each involves one tuning parameter. We applied a fine grid of tuning
parameter values to obtain the curves shown in Figs. 1–4. There are two tuning parameters for
Chandrasekaran et al. (2012). We set the second tuning parameter to equal ten times the first,
and consider a fine grid of the first. Similar results were obtained for different ratios of the two
tuning parameters.

where ΘO,O , ΘO,H , and ΘH,H encode the conditional dependence relationships among the observed variables, between the observed and latent variables, and among the latent variables. We
construct ΘO,O by randomly setting 10% of the off-diagonal entries to 0·3. For ΘO,H and ΘH,H ,
we randomly set 80% of the off-diagonal entries to 0·3. To ensure the positive definiteness of Θ,
we set Θjj = |Λmin (Θ)|+0·2 for j = 1, . . . , p + h. Finally, we set Σ = Θ−1 .
We first generate the latent variables xiH for the n subjects from N (0, ΣH,H ). We then
simulate the R replicates for each subject from the conditional distribution of the observed
−1
variables N (ΣO,H Σ−1
H,H xiH , ΣO,O − ΣO,H ΣH,H ΣH,O ). The results for n = 100, p = 100, h =
{2, 5, 10}, and R = 10, averaged over 100 datasets, are presented in Fig. 1.
In general, our proposal outperforms Friedman et al. (2008), Meinshausen & Bühlmann
(2006), and the semiparametric exponential family graphical model, which do not model the
latent variables. As shown in Fig. 1(a), our proposal has performance similar to Chandrasekaran
et al. (2012), even though this is intended for the Gaussian setting which holds here, whereas
our approach is semiparametric. As we increase the number of latent variables, the low-rank assumption of Chandrasekaran et al. (2012) is increasingly violated. Our proposal, which does not
rely on the low-rank assumption, outperforms Chandrasekaran et al. (2012) when h is large.
Next, we investigate the role of the number of latent variables h and replicates R in the performance of our proposed method. We vary the ratio of R and h, while keeping n = 100 and
p = 100 fixed. In addition, to study the tradeoff between n and R, we keep p = 100 and h = 3
fixed, and vary n and R with nR = 600. The results, averaged over 100 datasets, are shown in
Fig. 2. From Figs. 2(a)–(b), we see that our proposal’s performance improves as we increase the
ratio R/h. From Fig. 2(c), we see that the performance of our method improves when R > 2.
This suggests that for a fixed experimental budget, that is, keeping nR fixed, it may be beneficial
to collect more than two replicates per sample.
Our proposal relies on Assumption 1, which states that the latent variables are constant
across replicates. We perform a sensitivity analysis by allowing the latent variables to vary
across replicates within each subject. Let zir be a h-vector with each element independently
drawn from a uniform distribution U [−, ]. We simulate the rth replicate for the ith obser−1
r
vation from N {ΣO,H Σ−1
H,H (xiH + zi ), ΣO,O − ΣO,H ΣH,H ΣH,O }. We consider five values of
 = {0, 1, 1·5, 2, 2·5}. Results averaged over 100 datasets are in Fig. 3, which shows that our
proposal is robust to small perturbations of the latent variables.
We now perform the pairwise decorrelated score test described in Algorithm 1, in order to
∗ = 0. The pairwise decorrelated score test involves two tuning

described in Section 4 of Guo et al. (2015). The results for n = 100, p = 50, h = 5, and R = 10,
averaged over 100 data sets, are presented in Fig. 4. Our proposal outperforms that of Ravikumar
et al. (2011), which does not model the latent variables.
As in Section 4·2, we perform the pairwise decorrelated score test of the null hypothesis
∗ = 0. We set λ = 0·005 in (10), so that the estimates ŵ
H0 : βjk
w
jk and ŵkj are sparse. The
tuning parameter λ in (7) is again chosen by cross-validation. The type I error and power for
p = 50, R = 10, and h = 5, over a range of sample sizes, are in Table 1. We see that the pairwise
decorrelated score test is able to approximately control the type I error rate at level α = 0·05.

5. A PPLICATION TO ADHD-200 DATA
We applied our method to the ADHD-200 data (Biswal et al., 2010). The data consist of
resting state functional magnetic resonance images on 197 subjects who have been diagnosed
with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and 491 control subjects. The number of images for
each subject ranges from 76 to 276. Covariates such as age, gender, site, and intelligence quotient

are also available. Similar to Power et al. (2011) and Qiu et al. (2016), we use 264 seed regions
of interest to define the nodes in the graphical model.
We treat the images for each subject as replicates, and treat the covariates such as age and gender as latent variables. However, certain covariates such as age and gender serve as confounders
that may alter the conditional dependence relationships among the variables. For instance, Qiu
et al. (2016) showed that the brain networks at ages 7, 12, and 22 years are quite different. Biswal
et al. (2010) showed that males and females have different brain connectivity networks. Thus,
standard techniques for estimating graphical models that do not model the latent variables may
yield inaccurate network estimates.
After removing subjects with missing values, we consider 465 control subjects in the dataset.
For computational purposes, we choose R = 10 replicates randomly for each subject. Assumption 2 may not hold, since the replicate brain images for a given subject are very likely to be
dependent. We standardize each seed region to have mean zero and standard deviation one for
each subject. Our proposal (7) involves one tuning parameter λ. For visualization, we set λ = 0·2
so that the estimated network is sparse, but in practice, λ can be chosen by cross-validation. We
then symmetrise our estimates using the intersection rule described in Section 4. This yields an
estimated network with 376 edges. Figs. 5(a)–(c) show coronal, sagittal, and transverse snapshots
of the estimated brain connectivity network.
We compare our proposal to that of Friedman et al. (2008), which does not model the latent
variables. We perform their proposal by treating the replicates as independent observations. For
ease of comparison, the tuning parameter for Friedman et al. (2008) is chosen to yield 376 edges.
The coronal, sagittal, and transverse snapshots of the estimated brain connectivity network from
Friedman et al. (2008) are plotted in Figs. 5(d)–(f).
The two estimated networks are somewhat different. For instance, we see from Figs. 5(b)
and 5(e) that the lower region of the brain connectivity network estimated by their proposal is
more densely connected than that of our proposal. This might be a consequence of marginalizing
over the latent variables, as discussed in Chandrasekaran et al. (2012). In contrast, edges in the
network estimated by our proposal seem to be more spread throughout the network.

6. D ISCUSSION
Our proposal can be generalised beyond estimating latent variable graphical models. For instance, in the context of regression, unmeasured confounders may remain constant across replicates. Without adjusting for these confounders, it can be shown that the estimated regression
coefficients for the observed variables are biased. Using the ideas laid out in this paper, one can
estimate the parameter of interest accurately by treating the confounders as nuisance parameters.

Our model requires that the replicates are mutually conditionally independent given the latent
variables; this is laid out in Assumption 2. In future work, it would be interesting to study whether
that assumption can be relaxed.
An R package latentGraph will be made available on CRAN.
