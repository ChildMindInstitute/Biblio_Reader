Abstract
Sharing drafts of scientific manuscripts on preprint hosting services for early
exposure and pre-publication feedback is a well-accepted practice in fields
such as physics, astronomy, or mathematics. The field of neuroscience,
however, has yet to adopt the preprint model. A reason for this reluctance might
partly be the lack of central preprint services for the field of neuroscience. To
address this issue, we announce the launch of Preprints of the R-fMRI Network
(PRN), a community funded preprint hosting service. PRN provides
free-submission and free hosting of manuscripts for resting state functional
magnetic resonance imaging (R-fMRI) and neuroscience related studies.
Submissions will be peer viewed and receive feedback from readers and a
panel of invited consultants of the R-fMRI Network. All manuscripts and
feedback will be freely available online with citable permanent URL for
open-access. The goal of PRN is to supplement the “peer reviewed” journal
publication system – by more rapidly communicating the latest research
achievements throughout the world. We hope PRN will help the field to
embrace the preprint model and thus further accelerate R-fMRI and
neuroscience related studies, eventually enhancing human mental health.

Introduction
Before submitting manuscripts to traditional journals for peer
review and publication, researchers in some fields routinely distribute the manuscripts as preprints within their field. In this
way, they receive early feedback, which may help in preparing
articles for definitive submission as well as rapidly propagating
novel ideas to their fields. The well-known central repository for
preprints, arXiv (http://arXiv.org), was founded in 1991 by Dr.
Paul Ginsparg for the field of physics. It gradually expanded to
include astronomy, mathematics, computer science, nonlinear science, quantitative biology, and statistics as scientists in these fields
began to embrace preprints (Ginsparg, 2011). arXiv now hosts
close to one million fulltext preprints (983,739 as of November 1,
2014). Registered users of arXiv can submit manuscripts (multiple
versions are allowed) and all users can freely browse, view and cite
any articles. Although arXiv lacks rating systems or a feedback
mechanism to let users recommend papers of interest to peers or
to provide feedback to authors, it is still an invaluable resource for
the fields it serves.
However, researchers’ attitude toward preprints, varies depending
on the field. The field of neuroscience has yet to adopt the practice
of releasing preprints. Instead, neuroscientists commonly circulate
their manuscripts to collaborators and colleagues for feedback
before submission, but distribution is private and limited to small
groups. The reason for such limited sharing might partly be the
lack of central preprint services for the field. Only in 2013 did
two preprint services dedicated to biology emerge for the field of
life science (Callaway, 2013; Van Noorden, 2012). The two preprint services, PeerJ Preprints (https://peerj.com/preprints/) started
by PeerJ, Inc. and bioRxiv (http://biorxiv.org) launched by Cold
Spring Harbor Laboratory, are providing preprint hosting services
with online feedback and comment systems. It is expected that
early feedback will be helpful for authors in revising and improving
their articles for later peer review process of traditional journals.
Furthermore, commenters can be acknowledged for their contributions in later publication. However, it is only the dawn of neuroscience preprints -- bioRxiv and PeerJ Preprints have only received

56 and 38 neuroscience papers, respectively (as of 11/1/2014, see
Table 1). More efforts to facilitate adoption of the preprint model
appear to be needed.
A subfield of neuroscience, neuroimaging, especially that which
focuses on resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging
(R-fMRI), has emerged as field which is embracing innovations
such as open data sharing (e.g., ADHD-200-Consortium, 2012;
Biswal et al., 2010; Di Martino et al., 2014; Hall et al., 2012;
Mennes et al., 2013; Milham, 2012; Mueller et al., 2005; Satterthwaite et al., 2014; Van Essen et al., 2013; Zuo et al., 2014), open
software sharing (e.g., Bellec et al., 2012; Rubinov & Sporns,
2010; Sikka et al., 2014; Song et al., 2011; Taylor & Saad, 2013;
Whitfield-Gabrieli & Nieto-Castanon, 2012; Xia et al., 2013;
Chao-Gan & Yu-Feng, 2010; Zang et al., 2012; Zuo & Xing, 2014)
and sharing of learning resources (e.g., Training Course in fMRI
(http://sitemaker.umich.edu/fmri.training.course) and The R-fMRI
Course (http://rfmri.org/Course)). As a method to investigate ongoing brain activity in basic, translational and clinical neuroscience
studies, R-fMRI has become an increasingly prevalent research
area especially in recent years (Fornito & Bullmore, 2012; Fox &
Raichle, 2007; Kelly et al., 2012; Van Dijk et al., 2010) considering
its sensitivity to characterize developmental, aging and pathological
features (Andrews-Hanna et al., 2007; Fair et al., 2008; Greicius,
2008; Zuo et al., 2010), subject-friendly data collection procedures in clinical samples, and high comparability and consistency
across studies and sites (ADHD-200-Consortium, 2012; Biswal
et al., 2010; Mennes et al., 2013; Tomasi & Volkow, 2012). This
field has expanded exponentially, now exceeding more than 1000
studies published per year (Figure 1). Given the emerging traditions
of openness in this field, and an increasing number of researchers
involved, we believe that the field can benefit from a preprint service that provides peer viewing and commenting.
Accordingly, we are announcing a preprint publication model for
catalyzing R-fMRI and related neuroscience studies. We have
designed PRN as a community funded, open-access, free-submission, “peer viewed,” preprint service. The goal of PRN is to

supplement the “peer reviewed” journal publication system by
supporting more rapid communication of the latest research observations throughout the world.

Implementation
We have implemented the PRN service based on the success of
The R-fMRI Network (RFMRI.ORG). The R-fMRI Network
(RFMRI.ORG) has been designed as a framework to support
R-fMRI studies. The R-fMRI Network comprises R-fMRI
researchers (the nodes) who are connected by sharing (the edges)
with each other. Through the network, imagers can efficiently
share ideas, comments, resources, tools, experiences, data, and
increasing knowledge of the brain. Researchers (nodes) with basic
neuroscience, methodological, or clinical backgrounds can connect with each other in the network. The R-fMRI Network currently has more than 5000 registered members, aiming to enhance
collaborations among researchers, especially to translate our
knowledge of basic neuroscience and methodology to clinical
applications (bench to bedside).
The R-fMRI Network (RFMRI.ORG) is designed with a forum system and an integrated mailing list based on drupal (http://drupal.
org) and mailman (http://www.gnu.org/software/mailman/). As an
online forum system, The R-fMRI Network allows researchers to
propose research ideas, discuss controversial issues, request help in
using software, share experiences, report preliminary results, initiate collaborations and even seek jobs. The R-fMRI Network hosts
several instances of R-fMRI software (e.g., DPABI, DPARSF and
GraphVar), online learning resources, open data links, and gathers
the latest R-fMRI related studies from PubMed. All new posts are
sent to all R-fMRI Network registered users via an integrated mailing list, and users can comment on any post by directly replying to
the mailing list.
The PRN has been built based on the existing infrastructure of
RFMRI.ORG. Submission of a manuscript is as easy as posting a forum post with the paper title as the post title, manuscript
title page and abstract as the post content and a PDF version of
the fulltext manuscript as an attachment of the post. The preprint
manuscript will have a permanent online URL with a convenient

All submissions to PRN are preprint submissions, thus authors
can freely revise and submit unrevised or revised manuscripts to
formal “peer reviewed” traditional journals which allow preprints.
PRN only checks the format of manuscripts, and contacts the
corresponding author to confirm his/her approval of submission. As
a preprint service, PRN has no peer review process and no editing
service.

Open-access
All PRN articles are freely available online after submission.
Readers can freely read, download and comment on articles. Like
other posts at the R-fMRI Network, all submissions are dated, citable with a permanent URL and indexed by Google. Furthermore,
each PRN submission has a unique URL with a time stamp such as
http://rfmri.org/PRN_140828001.
The PRN does not ask the copyright of the work to be transferred,
however, the PRN requires sufficient rights to distribute submitted articles in perpetuity as documented at http://rfmri.org/PRN_
140831001. In general, the authors should grant the PRN a nonexclusive and irrevocable license to distribute the article, or certify
the work is either under Creative Commons Attribution license, or
the Creative Commons Attribution-Noncommercial-ShareAlike
license.

Free-submission
Unlike other open-access journals, submission to PRN is free of
charge.
“Peer viewed”
Articles at PRN will be peer viewed by interested readers and also
by consultants. The PRN has enrolled a panel of consultants – each
obligated to comment on three PRN papers per six-month period.
On a monthly basis, PRN will rate “consultants’ choice” and “readers’ choice” articles. Furthermore, PRN will rate the most active
articles, i.e., those which elicited the most comments and revisions –
as a way to spur feedback and revision of articles.
Community funded
The PRN is a community funded effort. We encourage all researchers to make a small contribution at http://rfmri.org/HelpUs to help
the PRN effort, but this is completely voluntary.

Compatibility with traditional formal journals
A major concern is that traditional formal journals may refuse to
publish manuscripts which were previously made available online
on a preprint server. To address this concern, a cross-field discussion on preprints has been initiated with editors-in-chief of journals in neuroscience, physics and mathematics. An editor-in-chief
in physics responded that arXiv is invaluable for doing research
in physics, and is scanned by most physicists every day. Several

F1000Research 2014, 3:313 Last updated: 18 MAR 2015

editors-in-chief of Neuroscience journals have confirmed that
their journals do accept preprint manuscripts. Based on the information of Sherpa-Romeo (http://www.sherpa.ac.uk/romeo), we
have organized a table of PRN compatible journals (http://rfmri.
org/PRN_20140921001). The authors should pay a close attention
to the table (http://rfmri.org/PRN_20140921001) before submitting
preprint manuscripts to PRN, to avoid jeopardizing their subsequent
submission to PRN-incompatible journals.

Conclusions
We have launched PRN as a preprint service for catalyzing R-fMRI
and related neuroscience studies. By empowering this preprint
system with an online commenting system and mailing list notification system to promote the newest studies to the R-fMRI
community, as well as inviting R-fMRI experts as consultants to
comment on preprint manuscripts, we hope PRN will help the
field embrace the preprint model and thus accelerate R-fMRI and
neuroscience related studies, eventually enhancing human mental
health.

I wholeheartedly support novel approaches to publishing, especially those run by scientists for scientists
and free of commercial interests. Even though I believe a news article would be a better place for PRN to
advertise itself, I am happy to review this paper as a "Software Tool Article". I believe addressing the
following issues will make the manuscript better:
1. Discussion of "peer review" is very confusing. Putting the term in inverted quotes does not improve
readers understanding. In one paragraph you write "As a preprint service, PRN has no peer review
process and no editing service." just to follow by "Articles at PRN will be peer viewed by interested
readers and also by consultants."
2. There is a lot of future tense used in the paper. This combined with no signs or examples of the
platform being used gives the impression that you are describing features you plan to implement
rather than existing and mature software solution.
3. It would be good to show how does this service compare to using other existing preprint servers
combined with peer review platforms such as Publons or PubPeer.
4. Could anyone review a preprint using your platform?
5. Will the review be public and signed or anonymous?
6. Are the preprints indexed by Google Scholar (in contrast to just Google Web)?
7. I could not find a link to the code of your platform (this is a formal F1000Research requirement).
I have read this submission. I believe that I have an appropriate level of expertise to confirm that
it is of an acceptable scientific standard, however I have significant reservations, as outlined
above.

I found it is a great idea to have this kind of service for neuroimaging. One comment that can improve the
acceptability of this preprint service is: should the service require authors to notice the normal journals
that this manuscript has been archived in PRN? And should PRN share the review comments for the
accepted preprints with the standard journals?

Thank you very much for your comments!
We request the authors to reveal that the papers have been archived in PRN while submitting to
preprint compatible journals.
We will share the comments with traditional journals, and encourage the authors to to enclose with
their submission. The PRN is trying to work together with publons (publons.com) to get credits for
the commenters/reviewers.
Thanks,
