Highlights

• Differences in the middle frontal gyrus seemed to be trait-dependent.

Abstract
Obesity is associated with structural and functional alterations in brain areas that are often
functionally distinct and anatomically distant. This suggests that obesity is associated with
differences in functional connectivity of regions distributed across the brain. However, studies
addressing whole brain functional connectivity in obesity remain scarce. Here, we compared
voxel-wise degree centrality and eigenvector centrality between participants with obesity (n=20)
and normal-weight controls (n=21). We analyzed resting state and task-related fMRI data
acquired from the same individuals. Relative to normal-weight controls, participants with obesity
exhibited reduced degree centrality in the right middle frontal gyrus in the resting-state
condition. During the task fMRI condition, obese participants exhibited less degree centrality in
the left middle frontal gyrus and the lateral occipital cortex along with reduced eigenvector
centrality in the lateral occipital cortex and occipital pole. Our results highlight the central role of
the middle frontal gyrus in the pathophysiology of obesity, a structure involved in several brain
circuits signaling attention, executive functions and motor functions. Additionally, our analysis
suggests the existence of task-dependent reduced centrality in occipital areas; regions with a role
in perceptual processes and that are profoundly modulated by attention.

1. Introduction
Obesity is a chronic multifactorial health problem defined by excessive adiposity or body fat.
Although obesity is not usually strictly considered a brain disorder, multiple lines of
neurobiological research have revealed the existence of structural and functional brain alterations
associated with obesity (Dagher, 2012). Relative to normal-weight participants, obese
populations exhibit lower gray matter volume, cortical thickness and glucose metabolism in the
prefrontal cortex (Pannacciulli et al., 2006, Willeumier et al., 2011 and Marqués-Iturria et al.,
2014). In striatal structures, individuals with obesity seem to exhibit lower dopamine D2/D3
receptor availability (Wang et al., 2001 and De Weijer et al., 2011; but see Eisenstein et al.,
2013) and increased gray matter volume (Horstmann et al., 2011). Additionally, functional
neuroimaging studies have observed differences between participants with obesity and normalweight controls during reward processing. In response to food stimuli, participants with obesity
exhibited higher activation of the parahippocampal gyrus/amygdala, putamen and superior
frontal gyrus, along with lower activation of the insula and occipital areas (Nummenmaa et al.,
2012, Brooks et al., 2013 and García-García et al., 2014). To summarize, relative to normalweight controls, participants with obesity seem to present a widely distributed pattern of
structural and functional brain differences. This raises the question whether obesity is also
associated with alterations in the functional connectivity between brain regions. In this article,
we apply graph-theoretic measures of functional connectivity to both resting-state and task
functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data to address this issue.

Functional brain connectivity describes the relations between distinct brain areas based on the
correlation between fMRI time series (e.g., Lohmann et al., 2013). In obesity research, several
groups have examined functional connectivity by applying seed-based analysis or independent
component analysis (ICA). Studies using seed-based analysis have reported obesity-related
differences in connectivity between the hypothalamus and the medial prefrontal cortex and
striatum (Lips et al., 2014 and Kullmann et al., 2014a). Studies on ICA have shown that, relative
to lean counterparts, overweight and obese individuals displayed alterations in the default mode
network (Tregellas et al., 2011 and Kullmann et al., 2012), increased connectivity within the
salience network (Garcia-Garcia et al., 2013a and Kullmann et al., 2013) and decreased
connectivity within networks that include visual brain areas (Kullmann et al., 2013 and GarciaGarcia et al., 2013b).

Seed-based functional connectivity and ICA methods have proved extremely useful in examining
connectivity patterns for individual brain regions or specific components of interest. However,
studies are beginning to adopt the view of the brain as a complex large-scale network
characterized by interregional interactions. Along this line, graph theory offers a powerful
3

approach for studying complex whole brain functional connectivity patterns (Bullmore and
Sporns, 2009). As previously mentioned, studies have provided evidence that obesity is
associated with functional differences in a widespread number of regions and components (e.g.,
Brooks et al., 2013; Kullmann et al., 2013). Therefore, the use of methodological frameworks
accounting for the complexity of brain organization might certainly enrich our understanding of
the brain's role in obesity.

Functional centrality is a graph-theoretic measure that assesses the connectivity of nodes
(anatomical parcellations ranging from single voxels to extended brain regions) with the entire
network (Rubinov and Sporns, 2010). As such, centrality measures facilitate the localization of
functionally important brain regions based on the connection patterns associated with them
(Buckner et al., 2009 and Zuo et al., 2012). Two commonly used measures of centrality are
degree centrality and eigenvector centrality. Degree centrality indexes the total number of
connections for a given node (Buckner et al., 2009). Eigenvector centrality, on the other hand,
favors nodes that are strongly correlated with other nodes that are themselves central within the
network (Lohmann et al., 2010). Differences in degree centrality can be considered ‘local’, given
that this metric captures the amount of direct connections with a given node (Zuo et al., 2012).
Differences in eigenvector centrality, on the other hand, can be generally regarded as ‘global’ in
the sense that this metric captures ‘indirect’ functional connectivity (Zuo et al., 2012). In the
field of obesity, differences in whole-brain functional connectivity have been scarcely addressed,
with only one study examining obesity-related differences in eigenvector centrality. The authors
found an age-dependent association between eigenvector centrality in the cerebellum and
visceral fat distribution. The association was negative in the case of participants younger than 46
years and positive in participants older than 64 years (Raschpichler et al., 2013). This study was
insightful in identifying brain regions that exhibit centrality differences in obese participants.
However, more research is needed to characterize obesity-specific alterations in network
centrality, especially among young adults.

Functional connectivity can be analyzed using task-free (or resting-state) and task-based fMRI
protocols. Previous research on functional connectivity has shown that task-related co-activation
patterns correspond well with brain systems that are measured at rest (Smith et al., 2009 and
Mennes et al., 2010). However, there is also evidence that task-based acquisitions may capture
specific dynamic neural responses in regions with a key role in task processing (Buckner et al.,
2009 and Mennes et al., 2013). Here, we compared participants with obesity and normal-weight
controls in degree centrality and eigenvector centrality. To capture a broader repertoire of
functional activity, we analyzed resting-state and task fMRI data acquired form the same
subjects. Previous studies have reported regional structural or functional brain changes
emphasizing the role of the prefrontal cortex in obesity. As such, we expected to find lower
4

functional centrality in obesity in the prefrontal cortex. Additionally, previous studies in food
processing suggest regional obesity-related differences extended to other brain areas, such as the
amygdala, insula or occipital cortex. Therefore, for the task fMRI condition, we expected to
observe further differences in these areas in participants with obesity.

2. Methods
2.1. Participants
Forty-one participants [20 participants with obesity (14 women); 21 normal-weight participants
(12 women)] aged 20–40 years were included in the study. Participants were included in the
obesity group if their body mass index (BMI) was ≥30 kg/m2 and in the normal-weight group if
their BMI was between 18.5 and 25 kg/m2 (exclusion criteria are detailed in the Supplementary
material). Before the scan, participants rated their subjective degree of hunger on a 10 cm visual
analog scale. The study was approved by the institutional ethics committee of the University of
Barcelona and was conducted in accordance with the Helsinki Declaration. Written informed
consent was obtained from each participant before the study began.

This study forms part of a broader line of research that aims to characterize obesity-related
differences in brain structure and function. Some of the participants in this report have been
included in other publications addressing different research questions. Previously, we examined
dopaminergic polymorphisms and executive functions (Ariza et al., 2012; 90% of the current
sample and 47 additional participants), cortical thickness (Marques-Iturria et al., 2013: 90% of
the sample; Marqués-Iturria et al., 2014: 100% of the current sample and 20 additional
adolescent participants) and functional brain components extracted from ICA analyses (GarciaGarcia et al., 2013a and Garcia-Garcia et al., 2013b: 71% and 88% of the current sample,
respectively). Here, we combine for the first time resting-state data and task-related fMRI data
from the same subjects to examine the patterns of functional connectivity associated with obesity
with a voxel-based network centrality approach.

2.2. MRI acquisition
Two hundred forty resting-state volumes were collected using a multi-slice gradient-echo EPI
sequence [echo time (TE): 19 ms; repetition time (TR): 2000 ms; 3-mm slice thickness; 40 slices
per volume; 25% interslice gap; 90° flip angle; 220 mm field of view (FOV); matrix size
128×128; voxel size: 1.7×1.7×3.0 mm³] covering the whole brain. Resting-state scanning was
followed by fMRI task data acquisition. Two hundred ten T2-weighted volumes were acquired
using a multi-slice gradient-echo EPI sequence (TE: 19 ms; TR: 2000 ms; 3-mm slice thickness;
5

40 slices per volume; 25% interslice gap; 90° flip angle; 220 mm FOV; matrix size: 128×128;
voxel size: 1.7×1.7×3.0 mm³) covering the whole brain.

A T1-weighted structural image was also acquired for each subject with the MPRAGE 3D
protocol (TE: 2.98 ms; TR: 2300 ms; 1-mm slice thickness; 50% interslice gap; 9° flip angle;
inversion time: 900 ms; 256 mm FOV; matrix size: 256×256; voxel size: 1.0×1.0×1.0 mm³).

The task protocol was a 7-min block design experiment in which participants were presented
visual stimuli subdivided into four categories: high-calorie food, low-calorie food, neutral nonfood and rewarding non-food images. Detailed information on the task fMRI protocol is
presented in Garcia-Garcia et al. (2013b) and in the Supplementary material. Since the duration
of the task was not long enough to permit the examination of centrality in each of the conditions
separately, the whole time-series of the fMRI task was used for the centrality analyses.

2.3. Preprocessing
All functional data were preprocessed using AFNI (Analysis of Functional Neuroimages;
http://afni.nimh.nih.gov/afni/; Bethesda, MD) and the FMRIB Software Library (FSL)
(www.fmrib.ox.ac.uk; Oxford, UK). Preprocessing was based on the fcon1000 scripts (available
at: http://fcon_1000.projects.nitrc.org). Specifically, preprocessing steps included: (i) discarding
the first six volumes from each subject; (ii) skull-striping of initial anatomical T1 scan; (iii) slice
time correction; (iv) motion correction; (v) 6-mm full width at half-maximum (FWHM) spatial
smoothing; (vi) mean-based intensity normalization of all volumes by the same factor; (vii)
linear and quadratic detrending; (viii) segmentation of skull-stripped T1 images into white matter
(WM), grey matter (GM) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) masks; (ix) linear registration of WM
and CSF signals to native functional space; (x) linear registration of the WM/CSF masks to
Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) space; (xi) masking WM/CSF masks with MNI binarized
tissue prior maps; (xii) thresholding WM mask at a probability of 0.66 and CSF mask at a
probability of 0.4; (xiii) band pass temporal filtering (0.005–0.1 Hz); (xiv) regression of the eight
nuisance signals (WM, CSF and six motion parameters).

The output of these preprocessing steps was a 4D residual functional volume in native functional
space, for each participant. The 4D native data were registered to the MNI152 template with 3mm resolution using affine transformation.

6

2.4. Centrality measures
After preprocessing, we analyzed degree centrality and eigenvector centrality using the LIPSIA
software package (Lohmann et al., 2001). Degree centrality attributes a greater value to a voxel if
it has strong connections with many other voxels in the brain. Let A denote an n×n similarity
matrix with non-negative values only, where entries aij contain a pairwise similarity measure
between the time series in voxels i and j. The degree xi of a node i is defined as
𝑥𝑖 = ∑

𝑎𝑖𝑗

𝑗

Eigenvector centrality, in contrast, identifies nodes that are connected to other nodes that are
themselves central within the network (Lohmann et al., 2010). Nodes with this property are
usually referred to as hubs ( Rubinov and Sporns, 2010). As above, let A denote an n×n
similarity matrix with non-negative values only. The eigenvector centrality xi of node i is
defined as the i-th entry in the normalized eigenvector x belonging to the largest eigenvalue λ of
similarity matrix A:
𝑛

1
𝐴x = 𝜆𝑥𝑜𝑟equivalen, 𝑥 = 𝐴𝑥, and𝑥𝑖 = 𝜇 ∑ 𝑎𝑖𝑗 𝑥𝑗
𝜆
𝑗=1

with proportionality factor μ = 1/λ.

Following the approach by Zuo et al., (2012), we restricted our functional connectivity analysis
to GM only, using a mask that contained all n voxels with GM tissue probability of 20% or
higher. This GM template was released as part of tissue priors in SPM8
(http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/sortware/spm8).

Degree centrality requires a thresholded similarity matrix. We used a Pearson's correlation
coefficient thresholded at r≥0.5. In general, Pearson's correlation might include spurious relations
in the similarity matrix, an effect that might be enhanced in the current analysis given the
relatively large number of GM voxels in the brain. To alleviate this problem, we chose this
relatively high correlation threshold. In the case of eigenvector centrality, we did not threshold
the n×n similarity matrix as this is not required by the method (Fig. 1). Before the statistical
analysis, we transformed the individual centrality maps to ensure Gaussianity.

7

Figure. 1. Schematic illustration of the analyses. We examined differences between participants
with obesity and normal-weight individuals in functional centrality. In those areas showing
group differences in centrality, we additionally conducted group comparisons using seed-based
analyses.

2.5. Seed-based connectivity analyses
To examine in more detail the connectivity patterns of the identified centrality changes,
centrality analyses were complemented by seed-based analyses, choosing as regions of interest
areas showing group differences in centrality measures. Seeds were constructed by drawing a 6mm radius sphere around the center voxels of these regions, and the time series for each seed
was extracted from the preprocessed data. Time series were averaged across all voxels in each
seed's sphere. For each individual dataset, the correlation between the time series of the seed and
every other voxel in the brain was determined. This analysis was implemented using 3dfim+
(AFNI) to produce for each subject individual correlational maps of all voxels that were
positively or negatively correlated with the seed's time series. Finally, individual correlation
maps were converted to Z-value maps using Fisher's r-to-z transformation.

8

Since we thresholded the n×n association matrix in degree centrality at r≥0.5, seed-analyses
derived from results in degree centrality were only reported if the average functional correlation
between regions was r≥0.5 as well.

2.6. Statistical comparisons
We conducted all the following analyses using SPM8.
First, we assessed general differences in functional centrality between resting-state and
task conditions. To do so, we conducted a voxel-wise paired t-test comparing the two
fMRI acquisitions across all participants.
Second, we compared obese and normal-weight subjects with the individual eigenvector
and degree centrality maps for the fMRI resting-state and task conditions separately.
Third, for the seed-based analysis, we compared the individual correlational maps
between groups (Fig. 1).
In all analyses, we entered as covariates sex and the subjective degree of hunger. Groups differed
on subjective degree of hunger, so we controlled for the possible effect of this variable.
Additionally, we decided to covay by sex given that previous studies have shown a sex effect in
centrality measures (e.g., Zuo et al., 2012).
We considered as significant results at p<0.001 uncorrected that additionally met a FDR
correction at a cluster level p<0.05 (thresholds obtained with SPM8).

3. Results
3.1. Demographic data
Participants with obesity and normal-weight controls were comparable in age, sex distribution,
years of education, vocabulary scalar score from the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-III,
anxiety, depression and toxic habits. They differed significantly in BMI and on the symptom
scale of the BITE test, a measure of compulsive eating behavior. Despite reporting being in a
similar fasting condition, participants with obesity reported diminished subjective degree of
hunger relative to normal-weight individuals (Table 1). Supplementary material presents a
further characterization of the participants including menstrual cycle phase and time of day at
which the scan was conducted.

3.2. Differences between the fMRI resting-state and task conditions
We tested for possible differences in functional centrality between the fMRI resting-state and
task conditions for all subjects. For degree centrality, the contrast resting-state fMRI>task fMRI
showed higher degree centrality in the precuneus, posterior cingulate cortex and medial frontal
10

pole. The opposite contrast (task fMRI>resting-state fMRI) revealed an increased degree
centrality in the occipital pole, lateral occipital cortex and fusiform cortex.

For eigenvector centrality, the contrast resting-state fMRI>task fMRI showed increased
eigenvector centrality in the precuneus, angular gyrus, precentral and postcentral cortices,
cuneus, posterior cingulate, middle temporal gyrus and right lateral occipital cortex. The contrast
task fMRI>resting-state fMRI yielded increased eigenvector centrality in the right lateral
occipital cortex, right lateral frontal pole and cerebellum (Supplementary Table S3 presents the
coordinates of these analyses).

Additionally, we examined which brain areas exhibited the highest degree and eigenvector
centrality for each acquisition. The results are presented in the Supplementary material (Table
S4).

3.3. Centrality measures during the resting-state acquisition
Relative to controls, participants with obesity exhibited lower degree centrality in the right
middle frontal gyrus during the resting-state condition (Fig. 2a; Table 2).

3.4. Centrality measures in the fMRI task acquisition
In the fMRI task acquisition, obese compared with lean participants exhibited lower degree
centrality in the left lateral occipital gyrus and in the left middle frontal gyrus (Fig. 2b). In
addition, participants with obesity showed smaller eigenvector centrality values in the lateral
occipital cortex and in the left occipital pole (Table 2 and Fig. 3a).

Fig. 3. Group differences in eigenvector centrality in the task acquisition. During the fMRI task
condition, participants with obesity exhibited diminished eigenvector centrality in the occipital
pole and lateral occipital cortex (LOC). We further examined connectivity differences on these
areas using seed-based analysis. Participants with obesity exhibited lower connectivity between
the occipital pole and the cerebellum, frontal lobe and thalamus. They also exhibited lower
connectivity between the LOC and the superior parietal cortex as well as between clusters inside
the LOC. We considered as significant results at p<0.001 uncorrected that additionally met an
FDR correction at a cluster level p<0.05.

3.5.1. Seeds from degree centrality
We did not find significant group differences with a mean correlation value r≥0.5.

3.5.2. Seeds from eigenvector centrality
Participants with obesity exhibited diminished connectivity between the seed located in the
lateral occipital cortex and the cerebellum, frontal pole and thalamus. They also exhibited lower
connectivity between the occipital pole and the lateral occipital cortex, and right superior parietal
lobe (Fig. 3b; Supplementary Table S5).

4. Discussion
In the present study, we compared obese participants with normal-weight individuals on
measures of whole-brain degree centrality and eigenvector centrality. We conducted the analyses
separately on fMRI resting-state data and fMRI task data acquired in the same subjects. Our
results suggest that, relative to normal-weight subjects, obese participants show a diminished
functional connectivity of the middle frontal gyrus and the lateral occipital cortex with the entire
brain network.

In recent years, previous studies have used ICA-based analysis to examine functional
connectivity in participants with obesity. Specifically, these studies have found differences
between participants with obesity and normal-weight controls in the functional connectivity of
several segregated functional networks, including the salience network (Garcia-Garcia et al.,
2013a and Kullmann et al., 2013), default mode network (Kullmann et al., 2012; Tregellas et al.,
2011) and visual networks (Garcia-Garcia et al., 2013b and Kullmann et al., 2013). Findings in
ICA can be associated with the principle of segregation (or modularity) in functional
connectivity, a principle that refers to the organization of the brain into a set of components (or
independent functional networks) whose constituent regions exhibit dense interconnections
(Sporns, 2013). In contrast, results in functional centrality, as applied in the current study, can be
related to the principles of functional integration and influence. The principle of integration
addresses how the network as a whole becomes interconnected and describes the ability to
rapidly combine specialized information from distributed brain regions (Rubinov and Sporns,
2010 and Sporns, 2013). The principle of influence refers to the importance of a given network
node in this process (Sporns, 2013). Therefore, the current study extends the previous work on
parcellated functional components by suggesting that obese individuals might have a reduced
16

functional integration, i.e., diminished information exchange, of the middle frontal gyrus and the
lateral occipital cortex with the entire brain network.

The middle frontal gyrus is a key structure in selective attention, working memory, inhibitory
control and monitoring (Fuster, 2002). It is located in the lateral prefrontal cortex and is heavily
interconnected with motor, auditory and visual areas (Fuster, 2008 and Barbey and Patterson,
2011). Studies of intrinsic functional connectivity have shown an involvement of the middle
frontal gyrus in several circuits encompassing a broad array of functional domains, including the
fronto-parietal network, the premotor network and the supplementary motor network (Laird et
al., 2011). Consistent with the involvement of impulse control in eating, studies in eating
behavior have found an increased activity of the middle frontal gyrus in conditions that require
an enhancement of attention control processes, such as during increased mental effort in order to
restrict food intake, as previously shown for healthy and lean participants (Hare et al., 2009 and
Hollmann et al., 2011). Given the complexity of whole-brain networks, results of functional
connectivity analyses often remain difficult to interpret. If one assumes behavioral relevance of
altered functional architecture, the obesity-related decreases in degree centrality in the middle
frontal gyrus might point at obesity-related deficiencies in inhibitory control. However, this
hypothesis needs to be further addressed with specific fMR-suitable tasks that directly target
inhibitory control processes, such as Stop Signal or Go/No-go tasks. We further analyzed the
functional connectivity of the middle frontal gyrus with the rest of the brain by means of seedbased analyses. However, we did not observe group differences in this analysis. The lack of
group differences might indicate that the lower degree centrality of the middle frontal gyrus is
related to a lower total sum of connections rather than fewer strong connections to very localized
areas. We observed obesity-related differences in the middle frontal gyrus both during the
resting-state condition and during the task paradigm. This indicates the robustness of the finding
and suggests the interesting possibility that alterations of the neural integration of the middle
frontal gyrus may reflect a trait feature of obesity instead of constituting a state-dependent result.

The occipital cortex is organized hierarchically and is highly connected with many other cortical
and subcortical areas, such as the middle temporal lobe, the parietal cortex, the thalamus and also
lateral prefrontal areas, via long-range projections (Haxby et al., 1994). Visual areas respond
robustly to visual food cues compared with neutral stimuli (e.g., Kroemer et al., 2013a; Huerta et
al., 2014). Additionally, hunger seems to have a powerful impact in primary sensory areas.
Studies presenting visual food stimuli have observed an increased activity in the occipital cortex
associated with a state of food deprivation (LaBar et al., 2001 and Stockburger et al., 2009) and
with high levels of the orexigenic peptide ghrelin (Malik et al., 2008 and Kroemer et al., 2013b).
As such, it has been proposed that hunger signals may facilitate perceptual processes and
selective attention towards food stimuli (LaBar et al., 2001 and Stockburger et al., 2009). In the

field of obesity, studies have reported obesity-related blunted activation in these areas in
response to food stimuli (Nummenmaa et al., 2012). As such, it is possible that the diminished
functional centrality in occipital areas may also underlie a reduced brain activity in these areas
during the visualization of food stimuli in obesity.

In our study, group differences in centrality in occipital areas were only statistically significant
during the fMRI task condition. It is well known that resting-state functional connectivity is
closely associated with task-related neuronal responses (Cole et al., 2014 and Smith et al., 2009).
Nevertheless, brain connectivity shows dynamic variations in regions with a key role in task
processing (Buckner et al., 2009). Accordingly, Buckner et al. (2009) compared high centrality
brain regions between a task-free condition and a semantic categorization task. While the overall
topography of such regions was similar between task-free and task-based conditions, regions in
the prefrontal and temporal cortex showed an increased degree centrality in the semantic
categorization task. In a similar vein, we observed that, across all subjects, the fMRI task
condition was associated with higher functional centrality in visual areas relative to the restingstate condition. This fact might have increased the sensitivity of the fMRI task for detecting
significant group differences in occipital areas. Conversely, relative to the task condition, the
resting-state condition was associated with higher functional centrality in areas ascribed to be
part of the default mode network, including mid-line cortical areas, such as the precuneus,
posterior cingulate or medial frontal pole (e.g., Greicius et al., 2003).

Functional connectivity differences in prefrontal and occipital areas have been previously
observed in studies on eating disorders. Patients with a current or past diagnosis of anorexia
nervosa exhibited lower degree centrality in the inferior frontal gyrus (Kullmann et al., 2014b),
lower connectivity within visual networks (Favaro et al., 2012), and higher connectivity of the
inferior frontal gyrus and precuneus within the default mode network (Cowdrey et al., 2012).
Patients with bulimia nervosa presented lower functional connectivity between the paracentral
lobule and the occipital cortex (Lavagnino et al., 2014). These alterations in the functional
connectivity of prefrontal, parietal and occipital areas were interpreted as suggestive of possible
alterations in inhibitory control behavior (e.g. Cowdrey et al., 2012; Kullmann et al., 2014b),
ruminative behavior (Cowdrey et al., 2012), visuospatial difficulties (Favaro et al., 2012) and
dysfunction in body-image processing (Lavagnino et al., 2014). The results in eating disorders
and the current results in obesity may suggest that alterations in the functional connectivity of
prefrontal and occipital areas could be associated with abnormal eating behavior. However,
future studies addressing individual differences in the continuum between normal and abnormal
eating behavior are needed to confirm this conclusion.

Our study presents several limitations that need to be acknowledged. (i) Eigenvector centrality
and degree centrality are based on an n×n similarity matrix representing pairwise correlations.
Such a matrix might contain spurious correlations. Specifically, despite a seemingly high
correlation between them, two regions a and b might not be directly connected if the covariance
between them can be explained by a third region c ( Varoquaux and Craddock, 2013). (ii)
Sample sizes were relatively small, albeit comparable to those in other studies on obesity.
Nonetheless, this fact may have limited the statistical power of the analyses, and it hampered the
analysis of potentially interesting interactions between gender and obesity. (iii) The fMRI task
consisted of four different rewarding conditions. Given the short duration of the task, however, it
was not feasible to examine functional centrality separately for each of the conditions. Future
studies should address this issue. (iv) Participants with obesity scored lower in subjective degree
of hunger, which could reflect the behavior of eating in the absence of hunger. To alleviate the
influence of this group difference, the factor was included as a covariate in the analyses. (v)
Finally, we ensured that both acquisitions (resting-state and task conditions) were long enough to
permit functional centrality analyses. Nevertheless, the total duration of the resting-state and the
task fMRI acquisition were different, which may have introduced subtle changes in the
functional connectivity dynamical fluctuation.

In sum, here we compared whole-brain functional connectivity between obese and normalweight subjects through the use of graph-theoretic network centrality measures. Our results
suggest that participants with obesity might exhibit state-independent diminished functional
integration of the middle frontal gyrus with the entire network, as well as task-dependent reduced
centrality of the lateral occipital cortex.
