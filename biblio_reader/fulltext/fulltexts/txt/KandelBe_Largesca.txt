Many studies of the human brain have explored the relationship between cortical thickness and cognition,
phenotype, or disease. Due to the subjectivity and time requirements in manual measurement of cortical thickness, scientists have relied on robust software tools for automation which facilitate the testing and reﬁnement of
neuroscientiﬁc hypotheses. The most widely used tool for cortical thickness studies is the publicly available,
surface-based FreeSurfer package. Critical to the adoption of such tools is a demonstration of their reproducibility,
validity, and the documentation of speciﬁc implementations that are robust across large, diverse imaging
datasets. To this end, we have developed the automated, volume-based Advanced Normalization Tools (ANTs)
cortical thickness pipeline comprising well-vetted components such as SyGN (multivariate template construction), SyN (image registration), N4 (bias correction), Atropos (n-tissue segmentation), and DiReCT (cortical
thickness estimation). In this work, we have conducted the largest evaluation of automated cortical thickness
measures in publicly available data, comparing FreeSurfer and ANTs measures computed on 1205 images from
four open data sets (IXI, MMRR, NKI, and OASIS), with parcellation based on the recently proposed Desikan–
Killiany–Tourville (DKT) cortical labeling protocol. We found good scan–rescan repeatability with both
FreeSurfer and ANTs measures. Given that such assessments of precision do not necessarily reﬂect accuracy or
an ability to make statistical inferences, we further tested the neurobiological validity of these approaches by
evaluating thickness-based prediction of age and gender. ANTs is shown to have a higher predictive performance
than FreeSurfer for both of these measures. In promotion of open science, we make all of our scripts, data, and
results publicly available which complements the use of open image data sets and the open source availability
of the proposed ANTs cortical thickness pipeline.

such topics of interest as autism (Chung et al., 2005), athletic ability
(Wei et al., 2011), male-to-female transsexuality (Luders et al., 2012),
obesity (Raji et al., 2010), and Tetris-playing ability in female adolescents (Haier et al., 2009). Although these ﬁndings are subject to debate
and interpretation (Gernsbacher, 2007), the availability of quantitative
computational methods for extracting cortical thickness measures has
proven invaluable for developing and reﬁning fundamental neuroscience hypotheses.
Computational methods for analyzing the cortex may be broadly
characterized as surface mesh-based or volumetric (Clarkson et al.,
2011; Scott et al., 2009). Representative of the former is the FreeSurfer
cortical modeling software package (Dale et al., 1999; Fischl and Dale,
2000; Fischl et al., 1999, 2002, 2004) which owes its popularity to public
availability, excellent documentation, good performance, and integration with other toolkits, such as the extensive FMRIB software library
(Smith et al., 2004). Similar to other surface-based cortical thickness estimation approaches (e.g., Davatzikos and Bryan, 1996; Kim et al., 2005;

Introduction

Q6

Magnetic resonance imaging-based structural analysis of the human
brain plays a fundamental role in identifying the relationship between
cortical morphology, disease, and cognition. Such research has yielded
insight concerning cortical variability and its developmental correlates
including those associated with normal aging (Walhovd et al., 2013)
and gender differences (Luders et al., 2006). Conditional abnormalities
from Alzheimer's disease and frontotemporal dementia (Dickerson
et al., 2009; Du et al., 2007) to Parkinson's (Jubault et al., 2011) and
Huntington's disease (Rosas et al., 2005) also demonstrate sensitivity
to cortical thickness assessments. Additional explorations have included

outer cortical surface. Other volumetric algorithms employ coupled
level sets (Zeng et al., 1999), model-free intelligent search strategies
either normal to the gray–white matter interface (Scott et al., 2009),
or using a min–max rule (Vachet et al., 2011). Most relevant to
this work is the DiReCT (Diffeomorphic Registration-based Cortical
Thickness) algorithm proposed in Das et al. (2009) where generated
diffeomorphic mappings between the gray/white matter and exterior
cortical surfaces are used to propagate thickness values through the cortical gray matter.
The general lack of availability of published algorithms (Kovacevic,
2006) (not to mention critical preprocessing components) is a strong
deterrent to the use or evaluation of these algorithms by external
researchers. For example, one recent evaluation study (Clarkson et al.,
2011) compared FreeSurfer (a surface-based method) with two volumetric methods, viz., Das et al. (2009) and Jones et al. (2000). Whereas the
entire FreeSurfer processing pipeline has been made publicly available,

MacDonald et al., 2000; Magnotta et al., 1999), the outer cortical and
gray/white matter surfaces from individual subject MR data are
modeled with polygonal meshes which are then used to determine
local cortical thickness values based on a speciﬁed correspondence
between the surface models.
Image volumetric (or meshless) techniques vary both in their
algorithms as well as in the underlying deﬁnitions of cortical thickness.
An early, foundational technique is the method of Jones et al. (2000) in
which the inner and outer surface geometry is used to determine the
solution to Laplace's equation where thickness is measured by integrating along the tangents of the resulting ﬁeld lines spanning the boundary
surfaces. Subsequent contributions improved upon the original formulation. For example, in Yezzi and Prince (2003), a Eulerian partial differential equation approach was proposed to facilitate the computation of
correspondence paths. Extending the surface-based work of MacDonald
et al. (2000), the hybrid approach of Kim et al. (2005) uses the discrete
Laplacian ﬁeld to deform the white matter surface mesh towards the

great detail (speciﬁcally in terms of suggested parameters), both
volumetric methods were implemented and run by the authors of the
evaluation (not by the algorithm developers) using unspeciﬁed parameters with relatively small, private data sets, making the comparisons less
than ideal (see Tustison et al., 2013 for further discussion concerning the
issue of instrumentation bias and scientiﬁc reproducibility in the use and
evaluation of software). Further complicating such comparisons is the
potential for bias, such as interpolation artifacts when converting surface
to volume data or vice versa (Klein et al., 2010).
We provide below a brief description of our proposed pipeline,
which produces a volumetric cortical thickness map from an individual
subject's T1-weighted MRI. Additionally, we note that it is freely available as part of the Advanced Normalization Tools (ANTs) software package. This includes all the necessary preprocessing steps consisting of
well-vetted, previously published algorithms for bias correction
(Tustison et al., 2010), brain extraction (Avants et al., 2010a), n-tissue
segmentation (Avants et al., 2011b), template construction (Avants
et al., 2010b), and image normalization (Avants et al., 2011a). More importantly, we provide explicit coordination among these components
within a set of well-documented shell scripts which are also available
in the ANTs repository where parameters have been tuned by ANTs developers (N.T. and B.A.).
Here we demonstrate the use of the described framework in processing 1205 publicly available, T1-weighted brain MR images drawn
from four well-known data sets. For comparative evaluation we also
process the same data using the standard FreeSurfer cortical thickness
processing protocol. Similar to previous work (e.g., Clarkson et al.,
2011), we are able to report repeatability assessments for both
frameworks using subsets of the data with repeated acquisitions. However, repeatability (or, more generally, precision) is not conceptually
equivalent to accuracy and, thus, does not provide a complete perspective for the determination of measurement quality. Although FreeSurfer

validation has included histological (Rosas et al., 2002) and imagedrawn (Kuperberg et al., 2003) comparisons, such manual assessments
were extremely limited in terms of number of subjects and the number
of cortical regions. In addition, there was no mention in these studies of
the number of human observers making these measurements or discussion of quality assurance. Alternatively, without ground truth, other
forms of evidence can be adduced (e.g., Bouix et al., 2007) in making
comparative inferences. In this work we use demographic-based assessments (based on well-studied relationships between cortical thickness
and age/gender) to show that ANTs outperforms FreeSurfer-based
thickness estimation for these data in terms of prediction.

A comparative evaluation between FreeSurfer and ANTs was run on
four publicly available data sets: IXI, MMRR, NKI, and OASIS. In addition
to these data, we used a subset of the MindBoggle-101 data labeled
using the Desikan–Killiany–Tourville (DKT) protocol (Klein and
Tourville, 2012) to deﬁne the regions of interest (ROI) in the analysis.
This latter data set was not included in the thickness analysis. All ﬁve
data sets are described below.

Public data for thickness estimation evaluation
Diverse and publicly available data sets collected from multiple
sites with a mixture of 3 T and 1.5 T T1-weighted brain images
were analyzed using the ANTs and FreeSurfer pipelines. Subjects in
this data set span the age range from 4 to 96 years old. This strategy
tested robustness to variation in head position, brain shape, defacing,
image contrast, inhomogeneity, imaging artifacts, ﬁeld strength, and
the broad variation in extracerebral tissue. Failure can occur in initial

IXI. Initially, we processed 581 T1-weighted images from the IXI data
set, but only 563 subjects (313 females, 250 males) were included in
the post-processing analysis due to missing demographic information,
which would have prevented an accurate estimate of the age at the
time of image acquisition. These data were imaged at three sites with
several modalities acquired (T1-weighted, T2-weighted, proton density,
magnetic resonance angiography, and diffusion tensor imaging). The
database also includes demographic information such as date of birth,
date of scan, weight, height, ethnicity, occupation category, educational
level, and marital status.

MMRR. The Multi-Modal MRI Reproducibility Resource (MMRR) data
set, was originally described in Landman et al. (2011) consisting of 21
subjects (10 females, 11 males) and features a rich set of modalities,
as well as repeated scans.

NKI. In support of open science, the 1000 Functional Connectomes Project was initiated on December 11, 2009 by various members of the MRI
community seeking to form collaborative partnerships among imaging
institutions for sharing well-documented multimodal image sets accompanied by phenotypic data. One such contribution is the Nathan
Klein Institute (NKI)/Rockland sample, consisting of 186 T1-weighted
images (87 females, 99 males).

OASIS. The initial Open Access Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS) data set
consisted of 433 T1-weighted images. We processed all of these data,
but 100 were excluded from our analysis due to probable Alzheimer's
disease (CDR N 0) and an additional 20 repeat scans were excluded,
resulting in 313 individual subject scans included in the normal group
statistical analysis (118 males, 195 females). Ages were between 18
and 96 and all subjects are right-handed.

Each component, including both software and data, is brieﬂy detailed below with the relevant references for additional information. Although other preprocessing components are possible (e.g., noise
reduction as in Smith, 1996), the major steps constituting the ANTs
pipeline are limited to those enumerated above.
The coordination of all the algorithmic components is encapsulated
in the shell script antsCorticalThickness.sh with subcomponents
delegated to antsBrainExtraction.sh and antsAtroposN4.sh. A representative script command is reproduced in Listing 1 for a single IXI subject
to demonstrate the simplicity and mature status of what we propose in
this work and a comparison with the analogous FreeSurfer command.

Anatomical template construction
Certain preprocessing steps, such as brain extraction and segmentation, rely on templates and corresponding spatial priors. In addition, normalizing images to a standard coordinate system reduces
intersubject variability in population studies. Various approaches
exist for determining an optimal template, such as the selection
of a preexisting template based on a single individual (e.g., the
Talairach atlas; Talairach and Tournoux, 1988) or a publicly available
average of multiple individuals (e.g., the MNI template by Collins
et al., 1994 or the ICBM template by Mazziotta et al., 1995), or an average template constructed from the individuals under study. The
work of Avants et al. (2010b) explicitly models the geometric
component of the normalized space during optimization to produce
such mean templates. Coupling the intrinsic symmetry of SyN
pairwise registration (Avants et al., 2011a) and an optimized
shape-based sharpening/averaging of the template appearance,
Symmetric Group Normalization (SyGN) is a powerful framework
for producing optimal population-speciﬁc templates. The ﬁve templates used in this evaluation study are represented in Fig. 2.

Brain extraction
Brain extraction using ANTs combines template building, highperformance brain image registration, and Atropos segmentation with
topological reﬁnements. An optimal template (Avants et al., 2010b),
i.e., a mean shape and intensity image representation of a particular cohort, is ﬁrst constructed using structural MRI data. Template construction iterates between estimating the optimal template and registering
each subject to the optimal template. In this work, we perform the additional step of building separate templates for each cohort and propagating the probabilistic mask to each cohort template using registration of
the T1-weighted templates (cf Fig. 2). A probabilistic brain extraction
mask for the new template can then be generated by warping an
existing mask to the template or by averaging the warped, whole
brain labels of subjects registered to the new template, if such labels
are available. Further reﬁnements include thresholding the warped
brain probability map at 0.5 and dilating the resulting mask with a
radius of two voxels. Atropos is used to generate an initial three-tissue
segmentation estimate within the mask region. Each of the three tissue
labels undergoes separate morphological operations including holeﬁlling and erosion. These results are then combined to create the brain
extraction mask which is further reﬁned by additional dilation, erosion,
and hole-ﬁlling operations.
In previous work (Avants et al., 2010a) we compared an earlier version of our extraction method with publicly available brain extraction
algorithms, including AFNI's 3dIntracranial (Ward, 1999), FSL's BET2
(Smith, 2002), FreeSurfer's mri_watershed (Ségonne et al., 2004), and
BrainSuite (Dogdas et al., 2005). Our hybrid registration/segmentation
approach performed with an accuracy comparable to FreeSurfer and a
parameter-tuned version of BrainSuite. Fig. 3 presents a visual comparison of results derived with the current ANTs brain extraction method
and results obtained using FreeSurfer.

Atropos six-tissue segmentation
In Avants et al. (2011b) we presented an open source n-tissue
segmentation software tool (which we denote as “Atropos”) that attempts to distill over 20 years of active research in this area, in particular some of the most seminal work (e.g., Ashburner and Friston, 2005;
Zhang et al., 2001). Speciﬁcation of prior probabilities includes spatially
varying Markov Random Field modeling, prior label maps, and prior
probability maps typically derived from our template building process.

N4 bias ﬁeld correction
Critical to quantitative processing of MRI is the minimization of ﬁeld
inhomogeneity effects which produce artiﬁcial low frequency intensity
variation across the image. Large-scale studies, such as ADNI, employ
perhaps the most widely used bias correction algorithm, N3 (Sled
et al., 1998), as part of their standard protocol (Boyes et al., 2008).
In Tustison et al. (2010) we introduced an improvement of N3, denoted as “N4”, which demonstrates a signiﬁcant increase in performance and
convergence behavior on a variety of data. This improvement is a result of
an enhanced ﬁtting routine (which includes multi-resolution capabilities) and a modiﬁed optimization formulation. For our workﬂow, the
additional possibility of specifying a weighted mask in N4 permits the
use of a “pure tissue” probability map (described below) calculated
during the segmentation pipeline for further improvement of bias ﬁeld
estimation.
N4 is used in two places during the individual subject processing (cf
Fig. 1). It is used to generate an initial bias-corrected image for use in
brain extraction. The input mask is created by adaptively thresholding
the background from the foreground using the algorithm of Otsu
(1979). Following brain extraction, six-tissue (cerebrospinal ﬂuid,
cortical gray matter, white matter, deep gray matter, brain stem, and
cerebellum) segmentation involves iterating between bias ﬁeld correction using the current pure tissue probability map as a weight mask and
then using that bias-corrected image as input for the Atropos segmentation step (described below).

MindBoggle-101 data for ROI deﬁnitions
In Klein and Tourville (2012) the authors proposed the DKT cortical
labeling protocol—a modiﬁcation of the popular Desikan–Killiany protocol (Desikan et al., 2006) to improve cortical labeling consistency and to
improve FreeSurfer's cortical classiﬁcation of 31 cortical regions per
hemisphere, listed in Table 1. Forty manually labeled brains were used
to construct the DKT40 Gaussian classiﬁer atlas, which is now bundled
with current versions of FreeSurfer and used to automate anatomical labeling of MRI data. Since the regional thickness values generated by
FreeSurfer follow this protocol, these anatomical labels provide a common standard for comparison between ANTs and FreeSurfer.
The work of Klein and Tourville (2012) also resulted in a publicly
available set of manually edited labels following the DKT protocol in
101 T1-weighted brain images from different sources, including a subset of 20 images from the OASIS data set (speciﬁcally, the test–retest
data). These 20 images are used in the MALF step that deﬁnes the volumetric cortical regions for each subject.

Additional capabilities include handling of multivariate data, partial volume modeling (Shattuck et al., 2001), a memory-minimization mode,
label propagation, a plug-and-play architecture for incorporation of
novel likelihood models which include both parametric and nonparametric models for both scalar and tensorial images, and alternative
posterior formulations for different segmentation tasks.
Due to the important interplay between segmentation and bias correction, we perform multiple N4 ⇌ Atropos iterations. A pure tissue
probability weight mask generated from the posterior probabilities is
derived from the segmentation step. Given N labels and the corresponding N posterior probability maps {P1, …, PN} produced during segmentation, the N4 weight mask is created at each N4 ⇌ Atropos iteration from

One of the key insights of the original N3 development is the observation that inhomogeneities cause the intensity values of pure tissue
peaks to spread in the intensity histogram as though convolved with a
Gaussian. A core contribution of N3 is the proposed corrective step of
deconvolving the intensity histogram to accentuate the tissue peaks,
coupled with a spatial smoothing constraint. The pure tissue probability
mask is used in N4 to weight more heavily the inﬂuence of voxels corresponding to pure tissue types (as determined by the segmentation) during the deconvolution process while minimizing the contribution of
regions such as the gray/white matter interface where peak membership is ambiguous.
Atropos enables prior knowledge to guide the segmentation process
where template-based priors are integrated into the optimization with
a user-controlled weight. Modulating the likelihood and prior contributions to the posterior probability is essential for producing adequate
segmentations. Atropos weights the likelihood and priors according
to P(x|y) ∝ P(y|x)1 − αP(x)α where α is a user-selected parameter

which weights the tradeoff between the likelihood and priors terms. A
weighting of α = 0.25 is the default value based on our extensive experimentation with different parameter weights.
Since cortical thickness estimation only requires the cortical gray
and white matter, the deep gray and white matter (both labels and posterior maps) are combined to form a single “white matter” set. This
white matter set and the cortical gray matter are the only results from
the segmentation step that are used by the DiReCT algorithm (described
below).
To generate the priors for each T1 template, we used the multi-atlas
label fusion (MALF) algorithm of Wang et al. (2013) in conjunction with
a labeled subset of the OASIS data set.1 First, we normalized the labeled
OASIS subset to the template. We then performed MALF on the template
using the normalized labeled data as input. This resulted in a labeled,
parcellated template consisting of 100 + labels deﬁning the different
brain regions. We then condensed this template-speciﬁc labeling to
the six needed for our analysis, viz., cerebrospinal ﬂuid (CSF), gray matter (GM), white matter (WM), deep gray matter, brain stem, and cerebellum. For example, all cortical regions were assigned a single label
representing the gray matter.
These binary masks were then smoothed using Gaussian convolution with a one voxel-width kernel. Since the labelings did not describe
the extracerebral CSF, we augmented the CSF prior image with the CSF
posterior output from running each template through the segmentation
component of the above-described pipeline. This new CSF prior was
then subtracted from each of the other ﬁve prior probability images
and limited to the probability range of [0,1]. The prior probabilities for
the ﬁve templates used in this evaluation are given in Fig. 4.

Traditional assessment approaches, such as manual labeling, are
inadequate for evaluating large-scale performance. We therefore sought
to minimize failure rate, quantify the repeatability of cortical thickness
measures, and determine whether the ANTs pipeline reveals biologically plausible relationships between the cortex, gender,3 and age and
how its performance compares to the current de facto standard of
FreeSurfer-derived thickness estimation. Collectively, these surrogate
measurements allow us to establish data-derived relative performance
standards. Additionally, for completeness, we include timing results as
that factors into usability.

Given the documented variability in FreeSurfer results with version
and operating system (Gronenschild et al., 2012) (as we would expect
with our own ANTs pipeline), all data were processed using the same
ANTs and FreeSurfer versions on the same hardware platform. Processing
was performed using the Linux (CentOS release 6.4) cluster at the University of Virginia (http://www.uvacse.virginia.edu) using single-threading
with a maximal requested memory footprint of 8 Gb for ANTs and 4 Gb
for FreeSurfer. The development version of ANTs was used for processing
(git commit tag: 69d3a5a6c7125ccf07a9e9cf6ef29f0b91e9514f, date Dec.
11, 2013). FreeSurfer version 5.3 x86_64 for CentOs was downloaded on 5
December, 2013 (“freesurfer-Linux-centos6_x86_64-stable-pub-v5.3.0”,
release date: 15 May, 2013). The brain extraction and segmentation
results from both pipelines were visually inspected to screen for major
problems. No manual changes were made for any component of either
pipeline and no change was made to the settings of either processing
pipeline.

Age prediction assessment

437

Despite good repeatability with both ANTs and FreeSurfer, such
measures do not provide an assessment of accuracy or even relative utility. For example, strong priors can yield good repeatability measures but
potentially at the expense of data ﬁdelity thus compromising the quality
of models (statistical or otherwise) built from such results. Given that
ground truth is not available for these data or for the many studies
looking at brain morphology, an indirect method (or set of methods)
is required for determining the quality of thickness estimation.
For our ﬁrst assessment, we modeled age versus regional cortical
thickness values to determine which framework produces better predictive thickness estimates. We ﬁrst subdivided the thickness data
into training and testing subsets with an even split between the two
subsets.4 We then used the training data to create two models for
each pipeline: 1) standard linear regression and 2) random forests (a
non-parametric machine learning technique) (Breiman, 2001), for estimating age from both ANTs and FreeSurfer thickness values in the testing data.

linear model is

DiReCT cortical thickness estimation

have been made and incorporated into the program KellyKapowski.2
The more recent implementation has made numerous advances including multi-threading, written in rigorous ITK coding style, and has been
made publicly available through ANTs, complete with a unique command line interface design developed speciﬁcally for ANTs tools.

Comparison of the ANTs and FreeSurfer percent variability errors for
the 62 DKT regions for both the OASIS and MMRR scan–rescan data sets
is given in Fig. 5. Mean values are given in Table 2. Although the variance
is slightly greater for the set of ANTs measurements, statistical testing
per cortical region (two-tailed paired t-test, corrected using false discovery rate) did not indicate non-zero mean differences for either approach for any region.
We also calculated the intraclass correlation coefﬁcient (“ICC(2,1)”
in the notation of Shrout and Fleiss, 1979) to assess scan/rescan reliability. The ANTs thickness pipeline produced an ICC value of 0.98 and the
FreeSurfer thickness pipeline yielded an ICC value of 0.97, indicating
good scan/rescan reliability for both ANTs and FreeSurfer.

Traditional academic discourse encountered in the published literature rarely contextualizes peculiarities such as algorithmic nomenclature. We brieﬂy mention that this was
the source of a rare disagreement between the ﬁrst and last authors based, as many disagreements are, on a simple misunderstanding and not an affronting existential statement
concerning a certain favorite sitcom of the ﬁrst author's youth.

We recognize the distinction often made between “sex” and “gender” (cf http://www.
who.int/gender/whatisgender/en/). As the demographic information collected during the
course of the imaging studies is presumably self-reported, we assume that most selfidentify in terms of gender and, therefore, use the term “gender” in data descriptions.

Due to the limited range in ages across data sets, we restricted training and testing to the age range [20,80]. The resulting distributions are 467
illustrated in Fig. 6. In addition to a combined assessment, we also 468

We tried various training proportions between 10 and 90% (in increments of 10%) to
see if that had an effect on relative performance for both age and gender prediction comparisons. Although age predictive capabilities for both pipelines showed improvement
(gender prediction was mostly unaffected), the relative outcomes were the same.

All images underwent the ANTs and FreeSurfer pipeline processing
using the computational cluster at the University of Virginia. Processing
times varied approximately between 10 and 20 h per subject for both
pipelines for the entire cortical thickness estimation procedure although ANTs processing, on average, took slightly longer. Averaged
over all cohorts, ANTs required 15.7 ± 2.0 h per subject and FreeSurfer
required 14.1 ± 2.9 h per subject.
The propagation of the DKT labels to each subject using label fusion
as described earlier was performed in parallel and took anywhere between 40 and 80 h per subject for 16 serial image registrations and
the application of the joint label fusion algorithm (Wang et al., 2013).
For each subject, 20 atlas registrations are used to generate the labeling
for that subject. Therefore to do the MALF labeling for the entire cohort,
approximately 1200 × 20 = 24,000 registrations were performed. The
antsMalfLabeling.sh script mentioned earlier parallelizes the registration component which decreases the time for parallel computation
platforms.

Discussion

511

In the absence of ground truth, we used repeatability and prediction
of demographic variables to compare the ANTs and FreeSurfer cortical
thickness pipelines. The only major failure was the FreeSurfer brain extraction of a single IXI subject (IXI430-IOP-0990). Also, three NKI subjects were not processed to completion with FreeSurfer (1713515,
18755434, and 2674565) and were not included in the analysis. Although researchers might quibble over processing minutiae such as
the inclusion of too much (or not enough) of the meninges, we
approached our evaluation using more objective criteria which concern
all those engaged in this type of research. We are currently trying to develop methods to facilitate data inspection for quick quality assurance/
control.

512

Repeatability of thickness measurements

524

The OASIS data set and the MMRR data set allow us to test whether
the same thickness values emerge from T1-weighted MRI collected on
the same subject but at different times of the day or over a time separation within a few weeks. Although the ANTs cortical thickness pipeline
produced similar repeatability assessments as FreeSurfer in these data,
there are many additional issues to explore with the ANTs-based

perform separate model prediction for each of the three larger data sets
(i.e., IXI, NKI, and OASIS).
ANTs-based RMSE values were lower for both models and each of
the four different subset comparisons except for the random forest
model constructed from the OASIS data set. All mean RMSE values are
provided in Table 3.
To further elucidate the regional differences in predictive power speciﬁcally in the random forest model, we provide variable importance
plots for both pipelines using the mean decrease in accuracy measure
in Fig. 7. During random forest model construction (speciﬁcally the
out-of-bag error calculation stage), the decrease in prediction accuracy
with the omission of a single feature or variable is tracked and averaged.
Thus, those features which have the greatest decrease in mean accuracy
are considered to be the most discriminative. It should be noted that
correlative effects are not considered in the rankings.

have been evaluated with FreeSurfer which has shown good reliability

546
Although our thickness reliability measurements represent the com547
pound effect of registration, segmentation, anatomical labeling, and

the thickness computation algorithm, this correlation suggests that
these effects are non-random. That is, reliability measurements are inﬂuenced by characteristics intrinsic to the underlying neuroanatomy
as represented in approximately one millimeter resolution volumetric
T1-weighted MRI. Perhaps the least reliable region is the entorhinal cortex (region 4 in Fig. 5) which has a relatively small volume, is challenging to distinguish from surrounding structures (Price et al., 2010), and is
also relatively thin. Spatial variation in segmentation accuracy is known
to relate to a structure's volume and tissue characteristics and this has
led to a body of research on both segmentation and acquisition protocols that are optimized for speciﬁc regions. Perhaps the most substantial
work in MRI has focused on temporal lobe structures including the hippocampus. Both FreeSurfer and our own group have optimized protocols to address such concerns (http://www.hippocampalsubﬁelds.
com/). Given caveats associated with cost vs. beneﬁt, our current results
suggest that optimized protocols may be relevant for additional cortical
regions.

Voxel/vertex-based analysis

566

One of the limitations of our evaluation was the limitation of comparative analysis to mean ROI thickness values deﬁned by the 62 cortical
regions of the DKT atlas. Quite common in the literature, however, are
point-wise (vertex- or voxel-based) analyses (e.g., Chung et al., 2005).

567
568
569

The ANTs pipeline described in this work is equally applicable to such
studies. The only additional requirement is the speciﬁcation of the normalization template. For this work we opted for the ROI analysis to
avoid potential bias issues when navigating between surface and
volume representations (Klein et al., 2010). Future work will certainly
explore such analyses.

Although repeatability between ANTs and FreeSurfer is comparable,
such measures are not as useful in determining the utility of the measuring software. That is the reason we used a training and testing paradigm to evaluate how well both frameworks produce measurements
capable of predicting demographics which are well-known to correlate
with cortical thickness. Additionally, these demographic measures are
probably some of the easiest and most reliably obtained of all possible
demographic measures used for this type of assessment.
Previous research has used predictive modeling for comparing cortical thickness algorithms. For example, in Clarkson et al. (2011), classiﬁcation of healthy, semantic dementia, and progressive non-ﬂuent
aphasia categories using regional cortical thickness values was used to
determine the predictive modeling capabilities of different cortical
thickness processing protocols in 101 subjects. However, differential diagnosis of dementia (Neary et al., 2005) is not as straightforward as
obtaining a subject's age or gender and regressing that against cortical
thickness; the latter constitutes biological relationships that have been
well-studied and reported in the literature.
For age prediction, we used both a linear model (due to its general
ubiquity) and a random forest model (a non-parametric model to contrast with the linear approach) which showed overall good performance. Also, the linear and random forest models have the advantage
of being interpretable—that is, the models reveal the speciﬁc predictors
that are most valuable which makes comparison with previous age
versus thickness assessments possible.
For example, in Hogstrom et al. (2013), 322 T1-weighted MRI of
healthy adults with an age range of [20,85] were used, in part, to characterize the relationship between age and cortical thickness using
FreeSurfer and a similar linear modeling approach. Signiﬁcant ﬁndings
for age were reported in the “precentral gyrus, medial parts of the superior frontal gyrus, DMPFC, and rostral middle frontal cortex.” Based on
the cortical parcellation provided by the DKT atlas, we also saw similar
strong effects in the precentral gyrus (cf Fig. 7).
This study was limited to a cross-sectional investigation thus
limiting extrapolations of ANTs performance to longitudinal data unlike
recent FreeSurfer extensions which accommodate longitudinal data
(Jovicich et al., 2013; Reuter et al., 2012). Also, some users may choose
to segment and register with ANTs and subsequently employ any
alternative (e.g., surface-based) method for thickness estimation. Further work is needed by independent authors working on established
pipelines to better compare surface-based and volume-based thickness

579

Computation time

620

Computation time for the registration and segmentation components of the ANTs pipeline are substantial but are not signiﬁcantly
worse than those of FreeSurfer. It is likely that nearly as reliable results
can be obtained in much less time for many of the subjects in this study.
However, our interest in maximizing reliability and quality led us to
employ parameters in the registration, segmentation, and bias correction that are as robust as possible to differences in head position, the
presence of large deformations between template and target brains
and substantial inhomogeneity or other artifacts in the image content
itself.

Imaging biomarkers such as cortical thickness play an important
role in neuroscience research. Extremely useful to researchers are
robust software tools for generating such biomarkers. In this work
we detailed our open source offering for estimating cortical thickness directly from T1 images and demonstrated its utility on a large
collection of public brain data from multiple databases acquired at
multiple sites. To our knowledge, this study constitutes the largest
collection of cortical thickness data processed in a single study. We
anticipate that public availability of our tools and extensive tuning
on the speciﬁed cohorts will prove useful to the larger research
community. In this work, we only explored a portion of the potentially interesting investigations possible with these data. Since all
of the data are publicly available, further work can be easily pursued
by us or by other interested groups.
