Abstract
Functional connectivity (FC) measured over extended time periods of resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (static FC) has proven useful for characterizing individual differences in human brain function
and dysfunction. Recent studies have shown that resting-state FC varies over time scale of tens of seconds
(dynamic FC), exhibiting characteristic patterns of temporal variability in FC and transition dynamics of
short-lived FC configurations, known as ”FC states.” However, fundamental properties of FC states, such as
their network topology and the dynamics of state transitions, or dynamic FC ”flow” between states, as well as
their relations to static FC, are relatively unexplored. Here we investigated these basic properties of FC states
in humans and assessed how our characterization helps in uncovering individual age-related differences in
dynamic FC across the lifespan. We found that dynamic FC was broadly classified into two characteristic FC
states with a large propotion of weak FC (flat state) and strong FC exhibiting modular connectivity patterns
(modular state), and other states representing their mixtures. These flat and modular FC states were largely
constrained by the level of modularity present in static FC. Age-related differences in dynamic FC became
evident when we focused on the dynamic flow between the flat and modular FC states in sets of subjects
that were expressing lower levels of static FC modularity. These results contribute to our basic understanding of FC dynamics and suggest that classification of FC states can contribute to the detection of individual
differences in dynamic brain organization.

Significance Statement
Recent studies have shown that functional couplings among brain regions vary over time, and these functional
connectivity dynamics may offer unique opportunities for uncovering individual differences in brain function
and dysfunction. However, many basic properties of functional connectivity dynamics have remained elusive
so far. Here, we investigated the topology and flow dynamics of transient functional connectivity patterns or
states, and examined their potential for detecting individual differences. We show that taking into account
1

the long-time average of functional connectivity can aid in uncovering individual differences in the incidence
and flow of brief dynamic functional connectivity states over the human lifespan. Our study suggests that
dynamic functional connectivity may indeed reveal significant individual variation in brain dynamics.

Introduction
The human brain can be represented as a network (Bullmore and Sporns, 2009; Sporns, 2011), in which
structural white matter pathways support integration of information between functionally segregated regions
and modules (van den Heuvel and Sporns, 2013). Functional modules observed in spontaneous brain activity
(intrinsic connectivity networks; ICNs) exhibit consistent functional coupling patterns (Damoiseaux et al.,
2006; Fox and Raichle, 2007). The functional connectivity (FC) defining these ICNs is typically measured
as cross-correlation of fluctuations in the blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) signal, obtained from
5–10 minutes of resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) scans (static FC). The FC
observed with rs-fMRI has been successfully used for characterizing individual differences in brain organization, e.g., across clinical and control populations (Craddock et al., 2009; Lynall et al., 2010) or over
development/lifespan (Zuo et al., 2010; Cao et al., 2014; Betzel et al., 2014; Chan et al., 2014).
Recent studies have shown that resting-state FC exhibits significant variations on a time scale of tens
of seconds (Chang and Glover, 2010; Handwerker et al., 2012; Hutchison et al., 2013b; for a review, see
Hutchison et al., 2013a). This time-varying or dynamic FC has been characterized with temporal variability
of FC estimated at each connection (e.g., Zalesky et al., 2014) or with transition dynamics between a small
set of brief FC patterns, known as FC states, believed to be stable for short periods of time and reproducible
across time and subjects (Allen et al., 2014). There is growing interest in using these features of dynamic
FC to express individual differences in brain dynamics, which may uncover relations between temporal
fluctuation of FC and brain function supporting behavior (Calhoun et al., 2014).
Dynamic FC has been investigated in a variety of studies. For instance, at the level of individual connections, it was shown that temporal variability of FC is related to changes in cognitive states (Kucyi and Davis,
2014), differs depending on the location or type of connections (Gonzalez-Castillo et al., 2014; Zalesky et
al., 2014; Shen et al., 2015), and is to some extent constrained by static FC (Thompson and Fransson, 2015;
Betzel et al., submitted). At the level of connectivity patterns, transient FC states are associated with consciousness level and structural brain connectivity (Barttfeld et al., 2015), neuropsychiatric disorders (Damaraju et al., 2014), development (Hutchison and Morton, 2015), and ongoing cognition (Gonzalez-Castillo et
al., 2015). However, fundamental properties of FC states themselves, such as the topology of the states and
the dynamics of state transitions (or ”flow” of dynamic FC between states), remain relatively unexplored.
Importantly, previous studies have not taken into account how the static FC constrains the topological patterns and flow dynamics in FC states. Since both dynamic and static FC are estimated from identical time
series, these spatiotemporal properties of FC states are likely partially constrained by the static FC, as is the
case with the variability of FC at the level of individual connections. If so, then taking into account individual variations found in static FC may allow more sensitive detection of significant individual differences in
FC state profiles.
The present study was aimed at characterizing the spatial patterns and flow dynamics in FC states and
their individual differences. We found that these patterns and flow were related to the static FC, and this
2

relation was then used to differentiate individual differences in properties of FC states. Using publicly
available human lifespan rs-fMRI data (286 subjects; age range, 9.1–83.2 years), we show that dynamic
FC can be classified into non-modular (”flat”) and modular FC states and their mixtures. We demonstrate
that the incidence of the flat and modular FC states and the temporal flow between these FC states strongly
depend on the level of modularity present in static FC. Finally, by taking into account the variability of static
FC, we uncover individual differences in FC state patterns and flow across the lifespan.

Materials and Methods
Data set
All the data analyzed in this study were from Releases 1–5 of the enhanced Nathan Kline Institute-Rockland
Sample (NKI-RS Lite Releases: http://fcon_1000.projects.nitrc.org/indi/enhanced/
download.html). The data were collected with the approval of the institutional review board with written
informed consent provided by all subjects (Nooner et al., 2012).

Subject cohort
The total number of subjects in the five releases of the enhanced NKI-RS was 418. Subjects with psychiatric
diagnoses based on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV), or
with incomplete multimodal data were excluded from subsequent analyses. In addition, subjects with lowquality images were excluded using criteria incorporated into the Connectome Computation System pipeline
(CCS; http://lfcd.psych.ac.cn/ccs.html; see Xu et al., 2015 for the detailed procedure of
excluding subjects). This resulted in preprocessed rs-fMRI and diffusion MRI (dMRI) datasets from 316
and 285 individuals, respectively. Since dynamic FC is sensitive to subject head motion (Hutchison et al.,
2013a), we further discarded rs-fMRI data of 30 subjects by adopting a strict motion threshold; i.e., subjects
were excluded if the temporal mean of the framewise displacement (FD; Power et al., 2012) was higher than
0.1 mm (here FD was computed using the l2 norm of the six rotation and translation parameter differences in
motion correction, as described by Patriat et al., 2013). The final number of subjects in the rs-fMRI dataset
was 286 [101 males; age range, 9.1–83.2 years; median age (interquartile range: IQR), 46.0 (35.5) years]
and the number of subjects in the dMRI dataset was 285 [96 males; age range, 8.3–83.4 years; median age
(IQR), 47.3 (36.3) years].

Image acquisition
Imaging data were acquired using a 3 T Siemens Tim Trio scanner with a 32-channel head coil. As fast
sampling of rs-fMRI volumes is advantageous when focusing on dynamic FC, we utilized the rs-fMRI dataset
with the shortest repetition time (TR) of 645 ms with the following scanning parameters: echo time (TE)
= 30 ms, flip angle = 60◦ , voxel size = 3 mm isotropic, field of view (FOV) = 222 × 222 mm2 , and 40
slices (details of the MRI protocol are listed in http://fcon_1000.projects.nitrc.org/indi/
enhanced/mri_protocol.html). The rs-fMRI data were collected for about 10 min (900 time points)
in an eyes open condition. The dMRI data were acquired with TR = 2400 ms, TE = 85 ms, voxel size = 2

3

mm isotropic, FOV = 212 × 212 mm2 , and 64 slices. The total number of dMRI volumes was 137, which
included 128 volumes with an effective mean b-value of 1500 s/mm2 with different gradient directions and
9 interleaved low diffusion volumes (b0 images) with a b-value of 5 s/mm2 with the same gradient direction.
A T1-weighted structural image was collected with TR = 1900 ms, TE = 2.52 ms, flip angle = 9◦ , voxel
size = 1 mm isotropic, FOV = 250 × 250 mm2 , and 176 slices. This structural image was used for spatial
registration and normalization.

Image preprocessing
The acquired images were preprocessed using the CCS pipeline, which incorporates functions of standard
neuroimaging software: AFNI (Cox, 2012), Diffusion Toolkit (Wang et al., 2007), Freesurfer (Fischl, 2012),
FSL (Jenkinson et al., 2012), and SPM (Ashburner, 2012). The preprocessing steps of rs-fMRI included (1)
discarding the first volumes of 10 s, (2) removing and interpolating temporal spikes, (3) slice timing and
motion correction, (4) 4D global mean intensity normalization, (5) co-registration between individual functional and structural images, (6) regressing out the global, white matter, and cerebrospinal fluid mean signals
and Friston-24 motion time series (Friston et al., 1996), (7) temporal band-pass filtering (0.01–0.1 Hz), (8)
removal of linear and quadratic trends, and (9) projection of the preprocessed 4D time series onto standard
volumetric (MNI152) and cortical surface (fsaverage5) spaces. The dMRI preprocessing included (1) correction for eddy current distortions, (2) realignment of all images to the mean of b0 images, (3) diffusion tensor
fitting at each voxel, (4) computation of fractional anisotropy (FA) value in each voxel, (5) deterministic
streamline tracking using the FACT algorithm (Mori et al., 1999), and (6) co-registration between diffusion
and structural images. Details of the preprocessing steps of rs-fMRI and dMRI are described in Xu et al.
(2015).

Cortical parcellation
As we focus on the dynamics of FC within and between ICNs, we used a reliable functional cortical parcellation defined based on the similarity of intrinsic FC profiles in 1000 subjects (Yeo et al., 2011). The whole
cortex was separated into 114 regions of interest (ROIs) as a subdivision of 17 network components in Yeo’s
parcellation (Fig. 1 and Table 1; also see Betzel et al., 2014). The rs-fMRI time series from one ROI (dorsal
prefrontal cortex in the left hemisphere, numbered 84 in Fig. 1) was discarded due to its small surface area.
The remaining 113 ROIs were used as nodes of functional and structural networks.

FC metric and dynamic FC computation
As a metric of FC, we used the z-transformed Pearson correlation between pairs of rs-fMRI time series
averaged within each cortical ROI. The static FC was estimated using this metric computed from the total
duration of the time series. The dynamic FC was obtained by computing the correlation matrices with a
sliding window approach (Cs in Fig. 2A). We used a tapered window approach with windowing parameters
similar to those adopted in Allen et al. (2014). Specifically, the tapered window was created by convolving a
rectangle (width = 66 TRs = 42.6 s) with a Gaussian kernel (σ = 9 TRs = 5.8 s) and was moved in steps of
3 TRs = 1.9 s, resulting in the number of windows = 268. To assess the reproducibility of brief FC patterns,

are associated with the numbered ROI names shown in the right columns (for abbreviations, see Table 1).
The order of numbers corresponds to the order of nodes in FC matrices shown in subsequent figures.
we computed dynamic FC also with a different windowing approach, wherein an exponential decay window
was used (Zalesky et al., 2014) with a window width of 100 s and a step size of 1 TR.

FC state extraction
To extract brief FC patterns (i.e., FC states), we applied a k-means clustering algorithm to the windowed
correlation matrices concatenated over all subjects [C1 , . . . , CS ] (Fig. 2B). We used the same clustering
procedure as proposed in Allen et al. (2014) and adopted by Barttfeld et al. (2015). In this procedure, the
concatenated dynamic FC matrix was subsampled along the time dimension before clustering to reduce
redundancy between windows. The subsampling was performed by choosing local maxima of the time
course of windowed FC variance. The resulting subject exemplars consisted of 5537 instances with 19.4±2.8
(mean ± SD) windows per subject (range: 12–30). The k-means clustering was first applied to the subject
exemplars 500 times with the l1 distance metric and random initialization. The obtained median centroids

the lower right corner of Fig. 2B). In addition to the selected value k = 4, we also report properties of the
FC states corresponding to the centroids obtained with k = 2, . . . , 10 in Results.

PCA approach for data visualization
To visualize the trajectory of dynamic FC in a 2D space, we applied principal component analysis (PCA)
to the windowed correlation matrices (Fig. 2C). PCA was performed with the same decomposition steps
as those adopted in Leonardi et al. (2013) in which they focus on fluctuations around the temporal average
of dynamic FC. Specifically, the temporal means of Cs was subtracted from Cs individually: C = [C1 −
C1 , . . . , CS − CS ], prior to applying PCA. The principle components (PCs) were obtained by the eigenvalue
decomposition: CCT = UDUT , where U is a matrix containing the eigenvectors of CCT (i.e., the PCs of
dynamic FC) in its columns and D is a diagonal matrix containing the corresponding eigenvalues (see the
upper row of Fig. 2C). The weights of PCs were derived as UT C, representing the contributions of PCs in the
variability of FC over time (see the lower row of Fig. 2C). The trajectory of dynamic FC in a 2D space was

7

visualized by plotting the weights of PCs with the first and second largest eigenvalues (ratio of an eigenvalue
to its sum across all PCs, first: 3.76%, second: 2.29%, third: 1.76%, tenth: 0.87%).

SC computation
To examine relations between FC states and structural connectivity (SC), we quantified SC in a manner
similar to the procedure described in Honey et al. (2009). The SC strength was first calculated by counting
the streamlines between the cortical ROIs for each subject. To correct the potential biases of the size of ROIs
and the deterministic tracking algorithm (Hagmann et al., 2008), the streamline count between the i, j-th
ROIs Ni,j was weighted by the Euclidean distance between the i, j-th ROIs Li,j and the surface area of the
i, j-th ROIs Si and Sj : Ni,j /(Li,j (Si + Sj )). The imbalance of the magnitude between SC and FC strengths
was individually corrected by resampling the weighted streamline counts into a Gaussian distribution with a
mean of 0.5 and an SD of 0.1 (Honey et al., 2009), maintaining the rank order across the raw and resampled
values. We averaged the obtained SC strength across subjects and used it to investigate the similarity between
SC and clustering centroids of FC states. When averaging SC, we set to zero all those connections for which
no streamlines were found in more than half of subjects (density = 381/113 C2 = 0.060).

FC pattern metrics
We introduced metrics of FC patterns to this study to relate spatial connectivity patterns across FC states and
static/dynamic FC. In particular, we focused on the modular structure of functional networks (Sporns and
Betzel, 2016). A natural way to quantify this characteristic is by evaluating the modularity quality function
(or simply modularity) Q (Newman and Girvan, 2004) maximized by an optimal modular partition, or its
variant Q∗ (Rubinov and Sporns, 2011) optimized for the application to functional brain networks. However
different sizes or numbers of optimal partitions could result in systematic biases and confounds when comparing the modularity metric between networks (Good et al., 2010). Thus as a metric of FC modular patterns,
we used the absolute FC averaged over all edges |X|, where X is an arbitrarily FC matrix, because this metric
is rather simple and can be shown to increase when functional brain networks become more modular. We
mainly report results obtained with |X| after showing that Q∗ and |X| were highly correlated in our data,
though these two metrics uncovered essentially the same relationships across FC states and static/dynamic
FC. The metric Q∗ was computed using a function ”modularity louvain und sign” in the Brain Connectivity
Toolbox (http://www.brain-connectivity-toolbox.net). We ran this function 100 times in
each Q∗ computation and averaged the obtained values.

FC state metrics
The FC states were characterized according to the following three metrics: frequency, mean dwell time, and
transition probability (Allen et al., 2014; Damaraju et al., 2014; Hutchison and Morton, 2015). Frequency
is defined as the ratio of the number of windows classified into a particular state to the total number of
windows. Mean dwell time is the number of consecutive windows classified into a particular state, averaged
within each subject. We set to zero the mean dwell time of a state when no windows were assigned to
it. We omitted the first and last segments of windows in a subject’s time series from the mean dwell time
since the beginnings and end of these episodes fall outside of the recording period. We did not define the
8

mean dwell time of a state in a subject when all its consecutive windows overlapped with either the start
or end windows. The transition probability is measured as the averaged proportion of states in the window
immediately following a window with a particular state. We did not define the transition probability from a
state to another in a subject if no windows were classified into the corresponding state.

Multiple linear regression analysis
We performed multiple linear regression analysis to assess relations among age, the metrics listed above, and
subject motion. We used a standard multiple linear regression model: ys = β0 + βeT xe,s + βnT xn,s + εs , for
s = 1, . . . , S, where s is a subject index, S is the number of subjects, ys is a variable of interest (a target
variable), xe,s is a column vector of explanatory variables, xn,s is a column vector of nuisance variables, εs is
an error term, and β0 , βe , and βn are regression parameters to the constant term, explanatory variables, and
nuisance variables, respectively. When we investigated age-related changes in a target variable, the linear
term or the linear and quadratic terms of age were used as explanatory variables and gender, total intracranial
volume, and a motion variable (mean FD) were used as nuisance variables, as in Betzel et al. (2014). The
model order of age was determined according to the Akaike information criterion (AIC). A one-sample t-test
was performed on the regression parameter associated with the highest order age term. When we examined
the relationship between one of the metrics and a target variable, we used only the linear term of the metric
as an explanatory variable and performed a one-sample t-test on the corresponding regression parameter.
At that time, we added the linear and quadratic terms of age to the nuisance variables. When testing the
influences of subject motion, we used mean FD as a target variable with no term of nuisance variables.

Age group analysis
Age-related differences in FC states were further examined by creating age groups. For the analyses reported
in the main part of the paper, subjects were divided into five age groups, whose boundaries were placed such
that almost the same number of subjects belonged to each group. The age of subjects in each group ranged
from (1) 9–21 years, (2) 21–37 years, (3) 37–50 years, (4) 50–60 years, and (5) 63–83 years. The number
of subjects was 58 in the third group and 57 in the other groups. This age categorization was mainly used
for reporting group-averaged FC state metrics. The age group analysis was repeated with smaller (four) and
larger (six) numbers of groups.

Categorization of age groups
To assess age-related differences in FC states in more detail, we took into account the distribution of static
FC pattern metrics (e.g., mean absolute static FC: |sFC|) in each age group. According to the magnitude
of static FC pattern metrics, we categorized subjects in each age group (high/middle/low) and investigated
lifespan changes of FC states within each category. The high, middle, and low categories contain subjects in
the 100th–80th, 60th–40th, and 20th–0th percentiles of the static FC metric distribution in each age group
(11 or 12 subjects were in each category when the number of age groups was five). In Results, we present
subgroup-averaged FC state metrics across age groups. Using the categorization of age groups, we aim to
uncover the age-related differences that vanish when the subjects are put together into a group regardless of
their connectivity patterns in static FC.

Results
FC pattern metrics
The mean absolute FC value of a dynamic FC matrix, |dFC|, and the modularity of a dynamic FC matrix,
Q∗dFC , varied across time (Fig. 3A). The temporal average of the mean dynamic FC, |dFC|, [mean (SD)
across subjects, 0.419 (0.023)] was about two times larger than the mean FC of the static FC matrix, |sFC|,
[mean (SD), 0.246 (0.029)]. In contrast, there were no large differences in magnitude between the temporal
average of the dynamic FC modularity, Q∗dFC , [mean (SD), 0.496 (0.034)] and the modularity of the static
FC, Q∗sFC , [mean (SD), 0.501 (0.058)]. Static and dynamic FC were strongly correlated in both of the mean
FC and modularity metrics (|sFC|–|dFC|: p < 10−82 for the regression parameter, r = 0.85; Q∗sFC –Q∗dFC :
p < 10−85 , r = 0.87) (Fig. 3B). The mean FC and modularity were also correlated ( |sFC|–Q∗sFC : p <
10−21 , r = 0.56; |dFC|–Q∗dFC : mean correlation coefficient = 0.62) (Fig. 3B). No significant relationship
was found between these metrics and age (|sFC|–Age: model order = 2, p = 0.058; Q∗sFC –Age: model
order = 2, p = 0.13) (Fig. 3C), as well as between subject motion and age (Mean FD–Age: model order
= 1, p = 0.15). In subsequent analyses, the mean FC was mainly used as a metric of modular FC patterns.
Influences of subject motion on this metric were small (|sFC|–Mean FD: p = 3.3 × 10−3 , r = −0.17;
|dFC|–FD: mean correlation coefficient = −0.069) (Fig. 3D).

Properties of FC states
Figure 4A shows the clustering centroids of the four FC states as well as randomly chosen samples of dynamic FC matrices classified into each state, and Figures 4B, C, D, E summarize their basic properties. The
centroid of State 1 had a flat spatial pattern (Fig. 4A) and was characterized by the smallest mean FC of all
centroids (Fig. 4B). Individual dynamic FC matrices of State 1 exhibited the lowest similarity to their corresponding centroid (Figs. 4A and C) suggesting that the flatness of the centroid may result from the averaging
of many relatively dissimilar dynamic FC matrices. In contrast, the centroid of State 2 had a highly modular
spatial pattern (Fig. 4A), yielding the highest mean FC of all centroids (Fig. 4B). Large positive or negative FC within or between task positive networks (e.g., dorsal attention network, saliency/ventral attention
network, somatomotor network, visual network) and task negative networks (e.g., control network, default
mode network) characterized the spatial patterns of the State 2 centroid as well as its dynamic FC matrices
(Fig. 4A), resulting in high average similarity between the centroid and dynamic FC matrices (Fig. 4C). The
flat and modular States 1 and 2 were least similar among all pairs of state centroids (Fig. 4D) suggesting that
they represent ”extreme configurations” residing at opposite poles along a continuum, with other States (3
and 4) representing mixtures or intermediate patterns. Comparison to the average SC showed that State 1
exhibit the highest and State 2 the lowest similarity to SC with States 3 and 4 at intermediate levels (Fig. 4E),
while the difference between States 2 and 4 was less evident when the similarity was computed only from
pairs of structurally connected regions. We found essentially the same basic properties of these FC states
when we used the alternative set of windowing parameters.
Figure 4F presents the PCs of the dynamic FC matrices. The spatial patterns of the first PC (PC 1)
strongly resembled the patterns in the centroid of State 2. This means that the dynamic FC matrices during
episodes when the weight of PC 1 was positive were more modular and positioned more closely to the

The second PC (PC 2) had a very different spatial pattern from PC 1. PC 2 included relatively large positive

We also examined the properties of FC states with other numbers of clustering centroids (k = 2, . . . , 10).
We found that the two centroids obtained with k = 2 strongly resembled the flat and modular spatial patterns

and these flat and modular states also appeared to be represented as discrete FC states at all the settings of k.
The flat state was split into two flat states with k ≥ 7 but the modular state always appeared in a single state
class. Intermediate states, such as States 3 and 4 in Figure 4A, began to appear with k ≥ 3 and their number
increased as k increased.

probability matrix (Fig. 5B) shows that the FC states never directly move from the flat state (State 1) to the
modular state (State 2), and vice versa. This means that when traveling between the flat and modular states
dynamic FC always passed through the intermediate states (States 3 and 4). The overall frequency of states

13

was the highest in State 1 (0.34) and the lowest in State 2 (0.16) (the left panel in Fig. 5C). For the mean
dwell time, State 1 was occupied the longest (40 s) and the other states were occupied more briefly than State
1 (25, 28, 26 s in State 2, 3, 4, respectively) (the middle panel in Fig. 5C). No large differences were found
in the transition probability to other states, though the intermediate states had relatively higher probability
(State 3, 0.089; State 4, 0.096) than the flat and modular states (State 1, 0.070; State 2, 0.081) (the right
panel in Fig. 5C).
The FC state metrics in States 1 and 2 were largely constrained by the static FC (Fig. 5D). In State 1, the
frequency and mean dwell time negatively correlated with |sFC| (p < 10−39 , r = −0.71 and p < 10−15 ,
r = −0.48, respectively) and the transition probability to other states positively correlated with |sFC| (p <
10−25 , r = 0.60). The three FC state metrics in State 2 had the opposite sign of correlations with |sFC|
(frequency: p < 10−50 , r = 0.76, mean dwell time: p < 10−24 , r = 0.58, transition probability: p < 10−7 ,
r = −0.35). These relationships suggest that, in subjects with smaller (or larger) |sFC|, the flat (or modular)
state more likely appeared, lasted with a longer duration, and was less transitive to other states. The metrics
of the intermediate states were not strongly correlated with |sFC| (State 3, frequency: p = 0.96, r = 0.032,
mean dwell time: p = 0.033, r = −0.093, transition probability: p = 0.48, r = −0.07; State 4, frequency:
p = 3.4 × 10−4 , r = 0.21, mean dwell time: p = 0.057, r = 0.12, transition probability: p = 0.30,
r = −0.059).
While the frequency of the flat and modular states had a weak but significant correlation with mean FD
(flat: p = 1.7 × 10−4 , r = 0.22; modular: p = 0.049, r = −0.12), subject motion cannot explain the
relationship between the FC state metrics and static FC. We performed the same analysis procedures of
k-means clustering after further decreasing the motion threshold (mean FD < 0.06 mm; number of subjects
= 173). Once again, we obtained strong and significant correlations between |sFC| and the three FC state
metrics in the flat and modular states, while no significant correlations between the FC state metrics and
mean FD were found.
The linear relationship of the FC state metrics in the flat and modular states to static FC were preserved
after changing the FC pattern metrics from |sFC| to Q∗sFC . This indicates that these relationships were
independent of how we quantify the modularity in the spatial patterns of static FC.

FC state metrics across the lifespan
So far, all analyses with rs-fMRI data were carried out with all the 286 subjects whose age range was 9.1–83.2
years. We now turn to findings on age differences in the FC state metrics over the lifespan. We first examined
these differences irrespective of the static FC in each subject, though its spatial connectivity patterns largely
constrained the dynamics of the flat and modular states. Then we assessed the lifespan changes of the FC
state metrics while taking into account the static FC constraints.
Without static FC constraints
When we put subjects together into analyses regardless of the static FC, we did not uncover clear age-related
differences in the FC state metrics. In a regression analysis, no significant relationship was found between
the FC state metrics and age [Fig. 6A; frequency: p = (0.12, 0.066, 0.079, 0.11) for States (1, 2, 3, 4) with
model order = (1, 2, 2, 2); mean dwell time: p = (0.092, 0.65, 0.12, 0.36) with model order = (1, 1, 1, 1);

transition probability: p = (0.053, 0.53, 0.67, 0.38) with model order = (1, 1, 1, 1)]. In the age group
analysis, we detected some fluctuations in the FC state metrics across the lifespan (Fig. 6B), though the
magnitude of these fluctuations was small (the leftmost column of Fig. 8). Simple and interpretable changes
were not observed in the lifespan trajectories in the line plots, other than a small increase in the frequency
of State 2 in the transition between the age groups 1 and 2. Age-related differences in the FC state metrics
were again not obvious when we used alternative numbers of age groups (four and six).
No clear age-related differences were found also in the space spanned by the first and second PCs of the
dynamic FC matrices. The upper row of Figure 7 shows the PC embedding trajectories of the dynamic FC
matrices and the lower row of Figure 7 illustrates the PC embedding of FC state metrics (see caption to Fig.
7 for the manner of displaying the dynamic FC matrices and the FC state metrics in the PC space). The four
FC states were roughly separated along the PC 1 axis (States 1–2) and PC 2 axis (States 3–4), forming four
clusters in the PC space. No direct transition between States 1 and 2 occurs as is represented by the absence
of line connecting these two states. The PC embedding trajectory and metrics are useful for illustrating the
structure and dynamic relation of FC states in a compact form, whereas merely employing the PC space
embedding did not uncover clear age-related differences in the FC state metrics.

Figure 7: PC embedding dynamic FC trajectory (upper row) and FC state metrics (lower row) across age
groups. In the upper row, each dot corresponds to a dynamic FC matrix at a time window and its color
indicates the FC state assigned to this window. In the lower low, the frequency of a state is shown as the
size of a circle placed at the median coordinate of dots in each state. The mean dwell time is represented by
the transparency of the inner color of a circle and the transition probability is expressed by the width of a
line outgoing from a circle. Area of a circle and width of a line for showing the PC embedding metrics are
proportional to the frequency and transition probability, respectively. Linear gradation is used in a colormap
for showing the mean dwell time. Size and color legends for the metrics are same as those used in Figure 9.
With static FC constraints
By taking into account the metrics quantifying the level of modularity presented in static FC, we found
specific age-related differences in FC state profiles. Figure 8 shows the FC state metrics averaged within the
high, middle, and low categories of |sFC| in each age group, together with those averaged over all subjects in
each group, shown in Figure 6B, with the common ranges of the vertical axes. The lifespan trajectories of the
middle |sFC| category has profiles similar to those obtained without the static FC constraints. Interpretable
age-related differences were found in the increase when transitioning from the age group 1 to the age group
2 in the frequency of State 2. In the high |sFC| category, pronounced lifespan changes were observed in the
frequency of States 3, which followed a convex profile across age. More pronounced age-related differences
were obtained when we focused on the low |sFC| category. In this category, the mean dwell time of State 1
monotonically decreased across age groups 1–3. The frequency of States 1 also decreased with age, though
its lifespan trajectory did not yield a monotonic trend. The outgoing transition probability of State 2 decayed
when entering into the age group 2 (note that the averaging of this metric was performed only with three
subjects at the age group 1 due to zero frequency of State 2 in eight subjects). We also obtained similar
lifespan changes similar to those described above after replacing the static FC metric |sFC| with Q∗sFC ,
while the decrease of the State 1 frequency with age was monotonic in the low Q∗sFC category. The increase
of outgoing transition probability of State 1 early in life in the high |sFC| category (Fig. 8) was not evident
in the high Q∗sFC category. When we used the four and six age groups, the lifespan trajectories became more

and less smooth, respectively, while the age-related differences were similar to those obtained with the five
age groups.
The age-related differences in the FC state metrics were visualized within the PC space in Figure 9, where
the lifespan changes are characterized by the patterns of ”flow” structure across the FC states. For individuals
placed in the category with high |sFC|, the flow of dynamic FC among FC states mainly occurred from left
(State 1) to right (State 2) through intermediate States 3 and 4. For individuals placed in the category with
low |sFC|, the main direction of flow was reversed, occurring predominantly from the right (State 2) to the
left (State 1). The magnitude of the flow (as indicated by the asymmetry of transition probabilities out of and
in to States 1 and 2, together with the imbalance of frequencies and mean dwell times of these two states)
decreased with age in the low |sFC| category, with the largest flow observed in the youngest age group and
the smallest flow observed in the oldest age group. By categorizing the age groups using the information
contained in the static FC pattern, the PC embedding captured age-related differences in the flow structure
of dynamic FC across the FC states.

Discussion
We systematically characterized spatial patterns and flow dynamics in a set of brief FC configurations, referred to as FC states, over the human lifespan. Our analyses revealed that dynamic FC was broadly classified
into FC states with spatially flat and modular connectivity patterns as well as their mixtures, and the incidence of these flat and modular FC states and the flow between these states were strongly dependent on the
level of modularity in static FC. The finding that the flat and modular FC states were constrained by the static
FC enabled us to uncover lifespan changes in FC state profiles. Pronounced lifespan changes were observed
when focusing on age-related differences within subject subgroups with relatively lower static FC modular
metrics. These results highlighted the advantage of considering the static FC constraints when expressing
individual differences in FC states, together with the importance of our characterization of FC states from
the view point of their spatial patterns and flow dynamics.
Our analyses elucidated four basic properties of the FC states. First, the flat and modular FC states were
reproducible. Observation of these states with alternative numbers of centroids or another set of windowing
parameters, together with previous reports on these states with rs-fMRI data in humans (Allen et al., 2014)
and macaques (Barttfeld et al., 2015) support our focus on the flat and modular states. Second, the centroid
of the flat FC state was most dissimilar to its corresponding instantiations in dynamic FC while the modular
FC centroid was most similar (Figs. 4A and C). In the modular state, both the centroid and dynamic FC
matrices had large positive/negative FC within/between task positive and negative networks, indicating that
a rather stereotypic FC pattern of functional segregation was dominant. In the flat state, the centroid did
not well represent its dynamic FC matrices, suggesting that the flatness may result from the averaging of

18

many relatively dissimilar dynamic FC matrices with a variety of FC patterns. Third, the flat and modular
FC centroids were most similar and dissimilar to SC, respectively, (Fig. 4E), paralleling earlier results in
macaques (Barttfeld et al., 2015). This finding is also in line with a human study showing that FC matrices
averaged from dynamic FC being similar and dissimilar to SC exhibit low and high density of binarized
absolute FC (Liégeois et al., 2015), though they reported higher modularity to the former case probably
due to their use of absolute FC in modularity computation. The similarity between SC and the flat centroid
can be explained by the averaging out of temporally variable FC into a flat centroid, wherein relatively
high FC values were computed at stable functional connections. Shen et al. (2015) reported that SC was
associated with such temporally stable FC during rest. In contrast, in the modular centroid, large FC values
were computed at connections within task positive/negative networks regardless of the FC stability, resulting
in greater dissimilarity with SC. Fourth, the dynamic flow between the flat and modular FC states most
explained the variability of dynamic FC (Fig. 4F) and there were no direct transitions between these two
states (Fig. 5B). These results suggested that the flow between the flat and modular states well represents
the dynamic FC fluctuation. The major contribution of connectivity pattern switching in dynamic FC can
be associated with significant temporal variations of efficiency in functional brain networks (Zalesky et al.,
2014). Taken together, our findings provided new insights into spatial patterns and flow dynamics in FC
states.
We showed that the flat and modular FC states were largely constrained by the static FC (Fig. 5D).
Specifically, frequency, mean dwell time, and outgoing transition probability of these states had strong linear
relationships to the modular metrics of static FC, even with a small motion threshold realizing no significant
motion effects on these FC state metrics. Higher frequency, longer mean dwell time, and lower outgoing
transition probability of the flat/modular FC state were associated with less/more modular static FC. This
property can be attributed to a large number of irregular/regular spatial patterns in dynamic FC as quantified
by the FC state metrics, resulting in the expression of flat/modular spatial patterns in static FC. These results
establish a link between dynamic and static FC at a network level and complement recent findings on the
dynamic and static FC relationship at the level of individual connections (Thompson and Fransson, 2015;
Betzel et al., submitted).
The static FC constraints on the flat and modular FC states contributed toward uncovering lifespan
changes in the FC state metrics. When we investigated relations of age to the FC state metrics regardless
of the modular level of static FC, significant age differences were not found (Figs. 6 and 7). This indicates
that age–FC state relations over development reported in Hutchison and Morton (2015), wherein FC centroids were derived from mixtures of rest and task fMRI data, may become less evident when age-related
differences are examined across the lifespan and the FC centroids are obtained purely from rs-fMRI data.
Age-related differences were uncovered by stratifying individuals based on their rankings (high/middle/low)
in the modularity of static FC (Fig. 8), and most of these differences were robust with respect to the manner
of quantifying modular FC patterns and the number of age groups ranging from four to six. Particularly, for
individuals placed in the low modular category, pronounced lifespan changes were detected in the FC state
metrics projected into the PC-space flow structure (Fig. 9). For individuals in the low modular category,
where the flow from the modular to the flat FC state was dominant, the magnitude of the flow decreased
with age. The decrease of this flow means that the flat state dominance in dynamic FC becomes less evident
and instantiations in dynamic FC are attracted toward the modular state. Decreasing this flow early in life

19

is consistent with an observed trend of separating anatomically clustered regions in functional networks to
form task positive/negative networks over development (Fair et al., 2009). Decreasing this flow late in life
could be due to the disruption of SC in aging (Gong et al., 2009), especially for the connections between
high-degree hubs (Zhao et al., 2015). The age-related deterioration in structural hubs could manifest as a
stabilization or ”locking-in” of the modular state. In parallel, the organization of structural hubs might be
crucial in transitioning among a variety of dynamic FC patterns in the flat state. Monotonic decrease of the
flow to the modular state with age was not observed throughout the lifespan analyses. This finding suggests that the variability in the modular state was not simply redundant with an observed trend of decreased
functional network segregation with aging (Cao et al., 2014; Betzel et al., 2014; Chan et al., 2014).
This study has several methodological limitations. First, subject head motion is a potential confound
of our FC state analyses. Even though we excluded high motion subjects, removed and interpolated temporal spikes, and regressed out motion parameters both in image preprocessing and regression analyses, it
remains difficult to completely exclude potential biases due to subject motion. Second, k-means clustering
on windowed FC matrices can produce a potential bias on the FC state switching. As adjacent windows were
temporally overlapped, abrupt changes of FC patterns could be smoothed, so that direct transition between
the flat and modular FC states might be missed. Third, the contribution of the first and second PCs was
relatively low. While the FC states projected into the space spanned by these two PCs exhibited specific
structure as described in Results, significant FC variability was not accounted for in the PC projection plots.
Fourth, categorization of age groups reduced the number of subjects. This produced variability in the number
of subjects when averaging transition probability out of the FC states with small frequency (Figs., 8 and 9).
These issues have to be taken into account when interpreting the results.
Future directions of the present study include further detailed validation of our findings on the flat and
modular FC states. Assessing test-retest reliability using multisession data allows examining the reproducibility of the flat and modular states at the subject level. Investigating individual differences using other
types of demographic or behavioral data can help understanding the functional roles of these states in more
detail. Examining the properties of the flat and modular states using a computational model of FC switching
(e.g., in Hansen et al., 2015) is also important for future work. Simulating the transitions of FC patterns
allows exploring the static FC constraints in the absence of motion artifacts and searching model inputs that
switch the connectivity patterns could help in understanding the mechanism of the flow dynamics.
In conclusion, our study shows that dynamic FC was broadly classified into a set of FC states with
spatially flat and modular connectivity patterns and their mixtures. Flow dynamics across these flat and
modular FC states were strongly constrained by the level of modularly in static FC, and this relation was
useful for uncovering individual differences in FC state profiles across the human lifespan.
