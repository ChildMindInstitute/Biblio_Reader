Multivariate analysis (MVA) is a class of statistical and pattern recognition methods that involve the processing of
data that contains multiple measurements per sample. MVA can be used to address a wide variety of medical
neuroimaging-related challenges including identifying variables associated with a measure of clinical importance
(i.e. patient outcome), creating diagnostic tests, assisting in characterizing developmental disorders, understanding
disease etiology, development and progression, assisting in treatment monitoring and much more. Compared to
adults, imaging of developing immature brains has attracted less attention from MVA researchers. However,
remarkable MVA research growth has occurred in recent years. This paper presents the results of a systematic
review of the literature focusing on MVA technologies applied to neurodevelopmental disorders in fetal, neonatal
and pediatric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain. The goal of this manuscript is to provide a concise
review of the state of the scientiﬁc literature on studies employing brain MRI and MVA in a pre-adult population.
Neurological developmental disorders addressed in the MVA research contained in this review include autism
spectrum disorder, attention deﬁcit hyperactivity disorder, epilepsy, schizophrenia and more. While the results of
this review demonstrate considerable interest from the scientiﬁc community in applications of MVA technologies
in pediatric/neonatal/fetal brain MRI, the ﬁeld is still young and considerable research growth remains ahead of us.

1. Introduction
The developing brain is a distributed processing machine undergoing
rapid change. Basic functional tasks require the coordination and cooperation of neurons in multiple brain regions all of which are in a state of
rapid growth. Differences in brain activity between children and adults
(Casey et al., 1997; Thomas et al., 2001; Bunge et al., 2002), the structural
changes that many regions undergo during development (Reiss et al.,
1996; Gogtay et al., 2004; Fair et al., 2009; Supekar et al., 2009) and the
recruitment of large cohorts of age matched subjects are major challenges
facing researchers in fetal, neonatal and pediatric neuroimaging. Important information regarding brain function is encoded in distributed patterns of brain activity and structure (Mesulam, 1981; McIntosh et al.,
1996; Fox et al., 2005; Vaadia et al., 1995) and assessing/identifying
these distributed patterns is particularly challenging in a pediatric/
neonatal/fetal population due to small brain sizes, a rapidly changing
physiology, a high degree of brain plasticity, patient motion, increased
metabolism and an incomplete understanding of brain development.
Multivariate analysis (MVA) techniques (i.e. multivariate regression,
multivariate analysis of variance, machine learning, etc.) are advanced
statistical, computational and pattern recognition technologies that
evaluate multiple variables/measurements simultaneously. MVA technologies provide a theoretical improvement over traditional univariate
techniques which examine each acquired measurement individually.
MVA has particularly large potential in magnetic resonance imaging
(MRI) as many physiological and anatomical parameters can be measured, new measurements are constantly under development and distributed measurements across the entire brain are acquired. The ideal
way to combine a distributed set of a variety of different physiological
and anatomical measurements for any particular disease population is
not known a priori, making MVA research applied to the MRI-assessed
developing brain a fertile ﬁeld of ongoing investigation.
MVA techniques can be employed to discover what brain regions
and what physiological/anatomical measurements best help characterize different types of neurodevelopmental disorders. Furthermore, reliably predicting disease onset, detecting and diagnosing disease and
monitoring treatment response are extremely important challenges in
clinical pediatric neuroimaging, an area in which MVA technologies
are capable of assisting. MVA techniques can also be used to identify
clinical factors and imaging parameters that are associated with important issues such as patient outcomes, disease progression and more.
MRI provides a wide variety of different physiological/anatomical
measurements distributed across a subject's brain, thus providing a
wealth of information that may assist in an array of research problems
in both clinical applications and basic research. The most common
MRI method produces basic structural information related to the concentration of hydrogen protons. Water is the most abundant molecule
in the human body and two hydrogen protons are found in each molecule. Since the body regulates many tissues and organs by controlling
the concentration of water across membranes, structural MRI provides
excellent tissue contrast. Perfusion MRI measures blood perfusion by
tagging fast moving hydrogen protons in the blood stream and monitoring the tissues to which they are deposited. Functional MRI (fMRI) measures a blood oxygen level-dependent signal which is associated with
brain activity and is an important method for monitoring brain function
during an assigned task. Functional MRI is also used to monitor normal
blood oxygen levels in the brain while the subject is at rest (rs-fMRI).
Functional MRI is also extended to functional connectivity analyses
which often employ MVA technology to identify regions of the brain
with similar activation patterns. It should be noted that MRI based functional connectivity analyses merely infer connectivity based on similar
functional behavior; connectivity is not measured directly. Diffusion
weighted imaging (DWI) is focused on acquiring measurements of
water diffusion which can help identify a wide variety of tissue conditions. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is a directional extension of DWI
which measures water diffusion in many different spatial directions at

533

each pixel/voxel location in the brain. DTI allows the tracking of tissue
coherence that is often associated with neural ﬁber tracts whose presence
is inferred based on voxels exhibiting water diffusion directed towards
adjacent voxels. Thus DTI provides a direct measurement from which
connectivity is inferred. MRI can acquire considerably more types of
images as well that at present have not had a major impact in studies
focused on imaging-based MVA of pediatric, neonatal and fetal
neurodevelopmental disorders such as chemical exchange saturation
transfer imaging (which includes pH sensitive amide proton transfer
imaging) and MR spectroscopy (which is often not spatially resolved
but a single measurement that is acquired across the entire brain).
Variations in MRI modalities allow us to acquire a wide variety of measurements distributed across the pediatric, neonatal and fetal brain
in vivo. Furthermore, neurodevelopmental disorders can be associated
with abnormal physiological/anatomical measurements of various types
at a wide variety of different locations within the brain. Thus powerful
MVA techniques which combine multiple measurements have the potential to assist in identifying the physiological/anatomical conditions associated with the formation and presence of neurodevelopmental disorders.
MVA techniques also have the potential to inform prognosis prediction
and to monitor disease progression and therapeutic response.
MVA techniques have seen remarkable growth in interest from the
pediatric, neonatal and fetal imaging scientiﬁc research community in
recent years. An excellent review article on the use of MVA classiﬁcation
technologies in developmental brain imaging was published in 2009
(Bray et al., 2009), however, at the time of publication the number of
research studies using MVA in a pediatric, neonatal and fetal population
was limited. In the years since 2009, pediatric brain MRI studies
employing MVA technologies have exhibited such remarkable growth
that the topic warrants a systematic review. The goal of this manuscript
is to provide a concise review of the state of the scientiﬁc literature's studies employing brain MRI and MVA in a pre-adult population and focuses
on neurodevelopmental disorders.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Multivariate analysis techniques
MVA techniques can be divided into several classes of technology.
Multivariate statistical techniques are quite varied in their potential applications, with a prominent example being techniques focused on the identiﬁcation of measurements that are correlated with an important clinical
variable. With a large set of measurements available, MVA techniques
such as multivariable linear regression (Rencher and Christensen, 2012)
can be used to identify a subset of variables that are associated with an
important clinical outcome. MVA techniques such as multivariate analysis
of variance (MANOVA) (Warne, 2014) can help assess the effect that
changes in one variable have on dependent variables and can generally
help elucidate the existing relationships between dependent and independent variables. Multivariate analysis of covariance (MANCOVA)
(Smith, 1958) is a technique similar to MANOVA but allows the factoring out of noise or error introduced by a covariant variable. This review
will discuss many applications of multivariate statistics in a pediatric,
neonatal and fetal population which will help to further illustrate the
wide variety of potential uses of these techniques in a medical research
context.
Multivariate statistical techniques can also create new measurements
that are a combination of existing measures creating customized factors/
components that can represent underlying physiological conditions. This
is typically accomplished by transforming a large matrix of example measurements in an effort to isolate underlying patterns represented in the
dataset. One example technique is Factor Analysis (Harman, 1960), a
statistical method used to describe variability among observed, correlated
variables in terms of a potentially lower number of unobserved variables
called factors. Another example of this type of technique is Principal Components Analysis (PCA) (Dunteman, 1989), which uses an orthogonal

Author's personal copy
534

transformation to convert a set of measurements of possibly correlated
variables into a set of linearly uncorrelated variables called principal
components obtained by maximizing the variance in the initial dataset
represented by the computed components. Independent Component
Analysis (ICA) (Hyvarinen et al., 2004) represents an alternative technique capable of revealing hidden factors that underlie sets of random
measurements by assuming that these underlying components are
non-Gaussian signals. These data reduction methods involve summarizing many measurements with few measurements and bridge the gap
between statistical analysis techniques (which are typically employed
by researchers as a step in their study's data analysis) and related computational technologies (which can be integrated into automated and
semi-automated applications that can be used by physicians in a clinical
capacity).
A related class of analysis techniques have considerable overlap with
multivariate statistical approaches in that many also involve the selection of measurements and employ data reduction, however, they are
often considered technologies rather than statistical analysis techniques
with a prime example being machine learning (Carbonell et al., 1983).
Machine learning is further divided into two main approaches: supervised and unsupervised learning. Supervised learning is a class of technologies that use training data which is a collection of measurements
associated with multiple groups such as healthy controls and subjects
with a known neurodevelopmental disorder. The training data is used
to inform future predictions, allowing the computer algorithm to assign
new unknown samples to one of the training groups for which it was
provided example sets of measurements. Some supervised learning
algorithms include feature selection as part of the overall technology
(the process of selecting which measurements to rely upon for prediction), however, many do not and feature selection is often addressed as
a separate topic in the scientiﬁc literature. Example supervised learning
technologies include the support vector machine (SVM) (Vapnik, 1995),
artiﬁcial neural networks (ANN) (Yegnanarayana, 2009), linear discriminant analysis (LDA) (McLachlan, 2004), random forests (RF) (Breiman,
2001), k nearest neighbor (kNN) (Altman, 1992), Bayesian classiﬁcation
(Devroye et al., 1996) and the generalized linear model (GLM) (Nelder
and Wedderburn, 1972) which is also sometimes referred to as a multivariate statistical analysis technique, highlighting the considerable overlap between machine learning technologies and traditional statistical
MVA techniques.
Unsupervised learning differs from supervised learning in that these
MVA technologies are not provided with a set of example training data
on which to base predictions from new unknown samples. Instead, unsupervised learning technologies are tasked with performing a basic level of
pattern recognition on a medical imaging examination based on the
examination itself and the analysis strategies employed by the unsupervised learning technology. This typically involves dividing a medical
examination into multiple regions-of-interest which can facilitate
a variety of in depth analyses (this process is also referred to as
image segmentation). These technologies can be applied to isolating a
particular structure in the brain and can be used to monitor changes
due to healthy brain development or malformations due to the advent
of neurodevelopmental disorders. Unsupervised learning technology
can assist in the extraction of regional physiological statistics and in turn
can play a critical role in computer-aided diagnosis systems, supporting
high level patient wide diagnoses. Unsupervised learning technologies
can also play a useful role in tissue outcome prediction studies by delineating the extent of tissue damage at follow-up imaging. Example unsupervised learning technologies include the ISODATA algorithm (Ball and
Hall, 1965) and cluster analysis (Manton et al., 2014), a family of techniques that include k-means, hierarchical clustering and so on.
2.2. Validation overview
Validating the performance of the techniques and technologies used
in the analyses covered in this review is challenging as many MVA

approaches rely on provided training data (samples indicative of known
conditions). The training data is used to guide the MVA technique (for
example: supervised machine learning) allowing it to process new samples and classify them as belonging to one of the groups of training samples it was provided with. Ideally, training samples would be extracted
from one dataset and testing would be performed on an independent collection of patient data in order to ensure there is no overlap between the
training and testing samples employed as such an overlap could result in
unrealistically promising test performance metrics. In practice it is very
common for a researcher to only have access to a single dataset collected
at a research center with which they (or their collaborators) are afﬁliated
due to laws protecting patient data which prevents their medical examinations from being shared publicly. As such validation techniques are
required in order to accurately assess the performance of multivariate
analysis technologies when only a single dataset is available to the
researchers.
A variety of validation strategies are available for the evaluation of
MVA technologies on a single dataset. In leave-one-out (LOO) validation
the MVA technology is provided with all but one of the samples in the
dataset for training (Kearns and Ron, 1999). Testing is performed on
the single sample that was excluded. This process is repeated exhaustively such that each sample in the dataset is excluded from training
and assigned as the testing sample during one of the validation iterations.
A variety of possible performance metrics are computed in each validation iteration and after completion of all validation runs, the performance
metrics are combined using standard group based statistical analyses
(average values, standard deviations, etc.). K-fold cross validation (CV)
randomly assigns the dataset into a user deﬁned number of groups at
which point a group based leave-one-out procedure is repeated such
that each group is left out of the training samples and reserved for testing
(Kohavi, 1995).
Another validation procedure involves performing a basic randomized validation trial which typically involves randomly selecting a
predeﬁned percentage of samples for training and the remaining samples are reserved for testing (Levman et al., 2008). This randomization
is repeated for a user speciﬁed number of iterations and summary statistics are collected across all of the validation runs. Efron's bootstrap
(Efron and Tibshirani, 1994) is a variation of the basic randomized
trial involving the selection of n samples from a dataset with n total
samples for training (note that this allows multiple selection of a single
sample into the training group yielding approximately 63.8% of the total
samples for the training group). The testing group is made of the
remaining samples and the trial is repeated for a user speciﬁed number
of iterations. Note that although Efron's bootstrap allows a single sample
to be selected multiple times for the training data in a single iteration of
the validation, it ensures that there is no overlap between the training
and testing groups in each randomized validation iteration.
In another validation strategy, a single dataset is partitioned into two
temporally contiguous datasets. In this situation, the ﬁrst dataset comprises the examinations from the ﬁrst half of the retrospective review
period and the second dataset comprises the examinations from the
second half of the review period. This allows a pseudo-prospective
validation structure within a strictly retrospective analysis, whereby
the machine learning technology is trained on the samples during the
ﬁrst time period and is tested on those samples acquired after those
that were used for training. This testing strategy allows a simulation of
what one might expect from a prospective assessment of the technology
being evaluating.
Each time a validation strategy is employed, evaluative metrics are
calculated which help assess the quality of a given supervised learning
based technology. Sensitivity is a metric that evaluates the percentage
of patients with a given neurological developmental disorder correctly
diagnosed by the test as having that neurodevelopmental disorder
(Youngstrom, 2014). Speciﬁcity evaluates the percentage of patients
without a given neurodevelopmental disorder correctly diagnosed as
not having that disorder (Youngstrom, 2014). Overall accuracy is a

Author's personal copy

combination of what Sensitivity and Speciﬁcity assess in a single evaluative metric that measures the percentage of all subjects (with and without the neurological developmental disorder being tested for) that are
correctly diagnosed by the supervised learning technique. Receiver
operating characteristic curve analysis is a visual plot of the trade-off
between a test's Sensitivity and its Speciﬁcity (Youngstrom, 2014) as
the test bias is varied (the test bias is an adjustable parameter that
inclines the test to be more or less likely to assign a given sample
to the pathological or normal groups). The area under the receiver
operating characteristic curve (AUC: Area Under the Curve) is a common metric for evaluating the robustness of a test independent of a
ﬁxed test bias setting, with a value of 1 indicating a perfect test and
a value of 0.5 representing a test that randomly guesses. Receiver operating characteristic curve analyses represent one of the most robust testing methodologies available for the evaluation of MVA
technologies.
After assessment of the performance of a supervised learning technology with the aforementioned validation techniques, performance
metrics are interpreted and if deemed to be of particularly high quality,
the technology under consideration can be promoted to the gold standard
method for validation, a prospective trial. In a prospective trial, the technology under consideration is incorporated into the clinical care of
patients as they are being evaluated, assessed and treated in an ongoing
clinical setting.
2.3. Review Parameters
The search engine MEDLINE/PubMed was used for this systematic
review on May 4th, 2015. The search terms included were bMultivariate
pediatric brain MRIN or bmachine learning pediatric brain MRIN or
bMultivariate neonatal brain MRIN or bmachine learning neonatal
brain MRIN or bMultivariate fetal brain MRIN or bmachine learning
fetal brain MRIN. This yielded 166 articles whose titles and abstracts
were reviewed for appropriateness. Articles were excluded if brain
MRI was not performed in a fetal, neonatal or child/adolescent population. Articles were excluded if they did not involve an MVA that included the brain MRI data acquired as an important component of the
analysis (this includes measurements from MRI examinations being
incorporated into the MVA, MRI informed clinical diagnoses allowing
group stratiﬁcation prior to MVA, etc.). Articles were excluded if they
were not authored in English. Articles were excluded if they were
focused on healthy brains, normal neurological development, brain cancer, stroke, hemorrhage, brain injury, brain damage due to a medical
condition located outside the nervous system and related surgeries,
thus allowing this article to focus on a wide variety of neurological
developmental disorders. Articles from this search process that were
not excluded were analyzed for this systematic review and noteworthy
citations within these articles were considered for inclusion in this
review (subject to the same exclusion criteria).
3. Results
The results of this systematic review are divided into subsections
focusing on the main neurological developmental disorders addressed
in the literature, including autism, attention-deﬁcit hyperactivity disorder, epilepsy and neuropsychiatric disorders followed by a section
addressing the many neurodevelopmental disorders for which there
were very few studies that met our inclusion criteria.
3.1. Autism
Autism is a neurodevelopmental disorder deﬁned in the Diagnostic
and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) as characterized
by persistent deﬁcits in social communication and social interaction
that manifests as deﬁcits in social–emotional reciprocity, deﬁcits in
nonverbal communicative behaviors used for social interaction,

535

deﬁcits in developing, maintaining and understanding relationships
and restricted, repetitive patterns of behavior (American Psychiatric Association, 2013). The use of structural MRI in autism spectrum disorder
(ASD) is summarized in a previously published review article (Chen
et al., 2011), whereas the review presented here includes all types of
MRI acquisition (structural, diffusion, diffusion tractography, functional,
etc.). While some relevant studies have been published in conferences
(Ghiassian et al., 2013; Cates et al., 2008; An et al., 2010), Table 1 is provided to summarize the multivariate analyses applied to ASD presented in
the literature in journal form. Due to the inherent heterogeneity in
these datasets it is challenging to accurately compare the results between
studies. However, the most commonly presented performance metric
(Overall Accuracy — referred to simply as Accuracy in the Tables in this
review) is presented and alternative metrics such as Sensitivity, Speciﬁcity
and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) are
provided as well under the Results column. These results are performance
metrics typically assessing the developed technique's ability to discriminate between pathological patients and healthy controls. The number of
subjects with ASD is provided under the column labeled n. The feature
measurements used in the study are provided under the heading Features
relied upon, the MVA methodology used is provided under the heading

Validation. If an entry is not available for a given study “N/A” is entered
into the table. Fig. 1 provides a three-dimensional rendering of a structural MRI examination of a child with autism with an overlaid color map
representing cortical thickness as a demonstration of some of the creative
methods available for the analysis of the large amounts of data acquired in
modern MRI examinations.
The MVA autism literature demonstrates the feasibility of creating
technology that can contribute to the differential diagnosis of autism
relative to normal controls, ADHD and Asperger's syndrome. Furthermore, the autism literature demonstrates the feasibility of identifying
areas of the brain with abnormal structural and functional organization
among patients with autism.
3.2. Attention deﬁcit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)
Attention deﬁcit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), deﬁned in DSM-5 is
a developmental disorder with symptoms arising prior to the age of 12
characterized by a pattern of behavior that can result in performance
issues in social, educational or work settings (American Psychiatric
Association, 2013). ADHD is further subdivided into its Inattentive
form (children who exhibit distraction, forgetfulness, lack of attention to
detail, carelessness, etc.), its Hyperactive–Impulsive form (children who
exhibit ﬁdgeting, squirming, interrupting, excessive talking, etc.) and
the Combined form (children with both Inattentive and Hyperactive–
Impulsive symptoms). While some relevant studies have been published in conferences (Ghiassian et al., 2013; Mahanand et al., 2013;
Liang et al., 2012; Zhu et al., 2005; Wang et al., 2011), Table 2 is provided
to summarize the multivariate analyses applied to ADHD presented in
the literature in journal form. Due to the inherent heterogeneity in
these datasets it is challenging to compare the results between studies.
Table 2 is provided to summarize the results and facilitate comparisons
and is structured similarly to Table 1. The number of subjects with
ADHD is provided under the column labeled n, where entries marked
ADHD-200 indicate that the authors used the dataset provided by the
ADHD-200 Consortium's machine learning competition which included
approximately 285 examinations of patients with ADHD as well as controls, however the studies involved in the competition varied considerably in the exclusion of samples from their analyses. Fig. 2 provides
example structural MRI examinations of a patient with ADHD as well
as gray matter membership masks which allow for cortical assessment
independent of white matter development.
As a related aside, prenatal exposure to cocaine is associated with
ADHD as well as premature birth and birth defects. Deshpande et al.
(2010) demonstrated that multivariate analysis technologies can

from those studies that participated in the ADHD-200 competition
(see Table 2) helps illustrate the remarkable challenge associated
with producing high quality MVA research applied to brain MRI in
pre-adult populations.
The MVA ADHD literature demonstrates the feasibility of creating
technology that can contribute to the diagnosis of ADHD. Furthermore,
the literature demonstrates the feasibility of identifying areas of the
brain with abnormal structural and functional organization among
patients with ADHD.
3.3. Epilepsy and focal cortical dysplasia

Fig. 1. A 3D surface rendering of a structural T1 examination of a child with autism with
overlaid cortical thickness measurements (see color bar) (Jiao et al., 2010). Figure is
reproduced with permission.

Epilepsy, deﬁned by the International League Against Epilepsy
(ILAE), is characterized as any one of the following conditions: at least
two unprovoked seizures occurring N24 h apart, one unprovoked seizure
and a probability of further seizures (at least 60%) over the next 10 years
after two unprovoked seizures or diagnosis of an epilepsy syndrome
(Fisher et al., 2014). Epilepsy has a clear cause in only a minority of
patients diagnosed with the condition. Focal cortical dysplasia (FCD) is a
congenital abnormality characterized by neurons failing to migrate in
the proper formation in utero leading to misﬁring neurons that can
cause seizures and is one potential cause of intractable epilepsy. Due to
the inherent heterogeneity in these datasets it is challenging to accurately
compare the results between studies. Table 3 is provided to summarize
the results and facilitate comparisons and is structured similarly to

As a related aside, seizure disorders (epilepsy included) are rarely
treated with hemispherectomy, a surgical procedure involving the
removal or disabling of one of the hemispheres of the brain. Moosa
et al. (2013) used MVA to demonstrate that multilobar MRI abnormalities
in the contralateral hemisphere were correlated with poor language outcome in pediatric patients with seizure disorders who had underwent
hemispherectomy.
The MVA literature focused on epilepsy and focal cortical dysplasia
demonstrates the feasibility of creating technology that can contribute
to the detection and diagnosis of these conditions. Furthermore, the
literature demonstrates the feasibility of identifying areas of the brain
with abnormal structural and functional organization with the help of
MVA techniques and technologies.

SSD), deﬁned in DSM-5 as being characterized by two or more of the

it is challenging to accurately compare the results between studies.

that pediatric bipolar subjects exhibited smaller cerebral volumes and
that female pediatric bipolar patients exhibited smaller hippocampal
volumes. Their study was supported by a multivariate analysis of variance
(MANOVA) (Frazier et al., 2005). Mwangi et al. (2014) focused on differential diagnosis between healthy controls and subjects with pediatric bipolar disorder based on neuroanatomical abnormalities of the amygdala.
Their methodology yielded a diagnostic accuracy of 78%. Ahn et al. (2007)
performed a MANOVA analysis and concluded that subjects with bipolar
disorder had larger right nucleus accumbens volumes, a ﬁnding that
was most pronounced in the prepubescent group.
Depression is deﬁned in DSM-5 as being characterized by ﬁve or more
of the following symptoms which cause clinically signiﬁcant distress or
impairment in social or occupational functioning not caused by the direct
physiological effect of a substance or other medical condition: depressed
mood most of the day nearly every day, diminished interest in almost all
activities, weight loss, insomnia or hypersomnia nearly every day, psychomotor agitation, fatigue, feelings of worthlessness or guilt, diminished ability to think or concentrate and recurrent thoughts of death
(American Psychiatric Association, 2013). Wu et al. (2015) demonstrated that multivariate analysis techniques can be applied to the diagnosis
of depression with 78% accuracy. Juranek et al. (2006) investigated the
association between amygdala volume and depression/anxiety levels in
autistic children with MRI and multivariate analyses. Their results indicated that symptoms of anxiety and depression were highly correlated
with right amygdala volume, but not with left amygdala volume.
Obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) is deﬁned in DSM-5 as being
characterized by obsessions and compulsions that are time consuming,
not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance or other medical condition and not better explained by the symptoms of another

mental disorder (American Psychiatric Association, 2013). Obsessions
are deﬁned by recurrent or persistent thoughts, urges or impulses experienced as intrusive or unwanted and causing anxiety or distress with the
individual attempting to ignore or suppress such thoughts. Compulsions
are deﬁned by repetitive behaviors performed in response to an obsession
as well as behaviors aimed at preventing or reducing anxiety or distress
but are clearly excessive or are not connected with a realistic way to neutralize or prevent the subject's anxiety. Li et al. (2014) demonstrated
that multivariate analysis technology can be applied to the diagnosis
of OCD from DTI images yielding an overall test accuracy of 84%. The
study's results revealed white matter abnormalities based on measurements from the bilateral prefrontal and temporal regions, inferior frontal–occipital fasciculus, superior fronto-parietal fasciculus, splenium of
the corpus callosum and left middle cingulum bundle. Szeszko et al.
(2004) performed a MANCOVA multivariate analysis and determined
that pediatric patients with obsessive compulsive disorder had smaller
globus pallidus volumes than healthy controls and more total gray matter in the anterior cingulate gyrus but not the superior frontal gyrus.
Gender dysphoria is deﬁned in DSM-5 as characterized by individuals whose gender at birth is contrary to the one they identify with
(American Psychiatric Association, 2013). Hoekzema et al. (2015) demonstrated with MVA techniques that subjects with gender dysphoria
could be more accurately automatically discriminated from individuals
sharing their gender identity than from those sharing their inherited
gender based on spatially distributed gray matter patterns. The authors
studied gray matter distributions and regional volumes and reported
subtle deviations from natal sex in sexually dimorphic structures
which could represent signs of partial sex-atypical differentiation of
the brain in subjects with gender dysphoria.

The MVA literature focused on neuropsychiatric disorders demonstrates the feasibility of creating technology that can contribute to the
diagnosis of schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and more. Furthermore,
the literature demonstrates the feasibility of identifying areas of the
brain with abnormal structural and functional organization among
patients with neuropsychiatric disorders.
3.5. Other developmental disorders
Agenesis refers to the failure of a particular organ or tissue to develop
during embryonic growth. Agenesis of the corpus callosum is a congenital abnormality characterized by the complete or partial absence of the
corpus callosum. Jakab et al. (2015) investigated agenesis of the corpus
callosum with diffusion tensor imaging and the general linear model
multivariate analysis technique. Their results demonstrated that they
were able to reveal pathological ﬁber tracts in 92% of third trimester
patients. An example of diffusion tensor imaging results of an in utero
fetus with agenesis of the corpus callosum is provided on the left of
Fig. 4 and a DTI of a normally developing fetus on the right. Note the
comparative lack of ﬁber tracts connecting the left and right hemispheres
of the brain in the subject exhibiting agenesis of the corpus callosum.
Holoprosencephaly is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized
by malformation of the brain induced by incomplete cleavage of the
cerebral hemispheres and deep brain structures. Hahn et al. (Hahn
et al., 2006) investigated the neuroanatomical and clinical characteristics
of holoprosencephaly using the multivariate technique Factor Analysis.
Their analysis identiﬁed neuroimaging characteristics as a signiﬁcant
factor towards characterization of the variance exhibited in their data.
Neuroimaging combined with mobility, upper extremity/hand function
and expressive language accounted for 31% of the variance in their data.
Malformations of the cerebral cortex are a common cause of developmental delay and neurological deﬁcits. The multivariate diagnostic
system proposed by Alayon et al. (2007) was reported to yield a sensitivity of 100% and a speciﬁcity of 100% in the diagnosis of cortical
malformations. The corpus callosum, which is located beneath the cortex is the subject of an additional study (Peruzzo et al., 2014) which indicated that multivariate technology can assist in the radiological diagnostic
process.
Cerebral palsy is a group of permanent movement disorders that
develop in early childhood and is characterized by poor coordination,
stiff & weak muscles, trouble swallowing or speaking and tremors.

Grifﬁths et al. (2010) used multivariate analyses to identify predictors
in subjects with acute hypoxic–ischemic injury that can assist in differentiating dyskinetic cerebral palsy (subjects exhibit involuntary movement especially when attempting to move) from spastic cerebral palsy
(subjects exhibit muscle engagement in muscle groups that are supposed to only be engaged in a mutually exclusive manner). Children
with dyskinetic cerebral palsy were shown to have more frequent injury
to the subthalamic nucleus. Children with spastic cerebral palsy were
shown to have more severe damage to the white matter in the vicinity
of the paracentral lobule. Huang et al. (2006) presented an analysis of
DTI MRI ﬁndings of fetal, neonatal and pediatric populations with cerebral palsy using MVA based analysis of the diffusion tensor. Their results
demonstrated that limbic white matter ﬁbers are ﬁrst to develop and
association ﬁbers develop last.
Dyslexia is a condition characterized by difﬁculties with accurate
word recognition as well as by poor spelling and decoding abilities.
Hoeft et al. (2011) have demonstrated that MVA techniques could produce a test to indicate which children's reading skills would improve
with 72% accuracy based on fMRI and DTI. This prediction was based
on greater right prefrontal activation and right superior longitudinal
fasciculus white-matter organization. Froehlich et al. (2014) investigated the ability of multivariate technologies applied to functional MRI
data to distinguish between subjects resting and subjects engaged in a
reading task in an effort to better understand the neural underpinnings
of dyslexia. They reported 90% accuracy for discerning between subjects
reading and subjects resting.
Fragile X syndrome is a disorder caused by a single gene mutation
resulting in abnormal dendritic and synaptic pruning. Hoeft et al.
(2008) demonstrated that the application of multivariate pattern analysis technologies can yield a test that differentially diagnoses subjects
with fragile X syndrome from developmentally delayed subjects and
healthy controls with 90% accuracy. The approach presented relies
upon increased and decreased brain volumes in the posterior vermis,
amygdala and hippocampus. Turner syndrome is a genetic condition
caused by complete or partial absence of one X-chromosome in a female.
The condition is characterized by prominent cognitive weaknesses in
executive and visuospatial functions. Marzelli et al. (2011) used multivariate machine learning technology to discriminate between patients with
Turner syndrome and healthy controls. Machine learning results
identiﬁed neuroanatomical variations in individuals with Turner syndrome localized in the hippocampus, orbitofrontal cortex, insula, caudate
and cuneus.
Sanz-Cortes et al. (2013) demonstrated that multivariate technologies based on texture analysis could predict abnormal neurobehavior
from fetal MR imaging with an accuracy of 95% when based on the frontal lobe, 96% when based on the basal ganglia, 93% when based on the
mesencephalon and 83% when based on the cerebellum. Abnormal
neurobehaviour was assessed by the Neonatal Behavioral Assessment
Scale applied at an average of 42 weeks post birth. Cho and Shin

(2001) reported that MVA technologies could be applied to assist in the
diagnosis of brain dysfunction.
Ventriculomegaly is a disorder of the brain's ventricle system
characterized by dilated lateral ventricles induced by loss of brain
volume, infection, infarction, impaired outﬂow of cerebrospinal ﬂuid
from the ventricle system, impaired absorption of cerebrospinal ﬂuid or
disorders of the interventricular foramen (congenital malformation, infection, hemorrhage or tumor). Baffero et al. (Baffero et al., 2015)
employed MVA which indicated that progression of ventricular enlargement on serial ultrasound examinations was a signiﬁcant predictor of
major cerebral abnormalities. Their analysis supports the use of fetal
brain MRI in cases of persistent or progressive ventriculomegaly.
Hydrocephalus is a condition in which there is an abnormal accumulation of cerebrospinal ﬂuid in the brain. Mandell et al. (2015) employed
multivariate supervised learning technology to determine that large
ﬂuid volume was associated with a decrement in subject cognition.
Fukuhara and Luciano (2001) investigated patients with late-onset
idiopathic aqueductal stenosis, a narrowing of the aqueduct of Sylvius
which blocks the ﬂow of cerebrospinal ﬂuid in the ventricular system.
Their subjects were divided into those with symptomatic headaches
and those with hydrocephalus. Their study included MRI examinations
and MVA which indicated that age independently affected the type of
chronic symptoms.
Multiple sclerosis is a disease in which the subject's immune system
attacks the protective sheath known as myelin that covers nerves. Peche
et al. (2013) employed MVA and reported that the Callen MRI criteria
(subject exhibits at least two of the following three criteria: ﬁve or
more lesions, two or more periventricular lesions, or one brainstem lesion
(Callen et al., 2009)) predicts the diagnosis of multiple sclerosis in a
pediatric population.
Infants with extremely low birth weight are at increased risk of
inhibited growth, cognitive development and chronic diseases later in
life. Parikh et al. (2013) employed MVA techniques and showed that
surgery for retinopathy (damage to the retina of the eye) and surgery
for necrotizing enterocolitis (intestinal tissue dies off) or spontaneous
intestinal perforation (a lesion or hole in the intestine) were signiﬁcantly associated with increasing volume of white matter hyperintensities
on MRI in infants with extremely low birth weight.
Sturge–Weber syndrome is a congenital neurological and skin
disorder often associated with glaucoma, seizures, intellectual disability, cerebral malformations and benign tumors (angiomas). Juhasz et al.
(2007) investigated the association between white matter volume and
cognitive function in children with Sturge–Weber syndrome using volumetric MRI and MVA techniques which showed that hemispheric white
matter volume ipsilateral to the angioma was an independent predictor
of a subject's Intelligence Quotient (IQ) and negatively correlated with
age. No correlation was found with gray matter volume.
Several studies exist using MVA and brain MRI applied to a variety of
different benign tumors. Hausler et al. (2003) investigated neurological
inﬂammatory pseudotumors which are mostly benign growths characterized by ﬁbrotic ground tissue and polyclonal mononuclear inﬁltrate.
Their study included MR imaging and MVA. Their multivariate model
indicated that incomplete resection and female gender were associated
with a higher risk of recurrence after surgical removal. Arachnoid cysts
are a congenital disorder characterized by cerebrospinal ﬂuid covered
by collagen and arachnoidal cells. Al-Holou et al. (2010) employed multivariate analyses which demonstrated that initial cyst size and intracranial location correlated with the presence or development of symptoms
and surgical treatment. Neuroﬁbromatosis is a genetic condition characterized by cognitive dysfunction and carries a high risk of tumor formation, particularly in the brain. Duarte et al. (2014) demonstrated that the
application of MVA technologies can discriminate individuals with neuroﬁbromatosis from controls with 94% accuracy. Huang et al. (2005)
created an image matching system for retrieving similar exams to a
provided case of clinical interest. Their testing of the matching algorithm
included an examination of a patient with neuroﬁbromatosis, an

examination of a patient with an arachnoid cyst and a subject with an arterial venous malformation. Their image matching results were compared
to the opinion of a pediatric neuroradiologist which demonstrated that
the proposed approach exhibited highly varying performance with 0 to
60% of the matches yielding a correct diagnosis.
Batchelor et al. (2002) presented a set of measurements meant to
help quantify folding patterns in the brain from fetal MRI examinations.
They propose a multivariate approach to studying the shape of the
cerebral cortex to assist in quantifying brain folding. Their study focused
on the imaging of ex vivo brain specimens which included a wide variety
of pathological ﬁndings.
Auditory processing disorders affect the way the brain processes
information from the ears. These disorders are characterized by difﬁculties in recognizing and interpreting sounds despite normal ear
structure and function. Schmithorst et al. (2013) applied MVA technology to fMRI and DTI data of subjects with left ear advantage,
which is often regarded by clinical audiologists as an indicator for auditory processing disorders. The results indicated that left ear advantage was predicted by increased axial diffusivity in the left internal
capsule and decreased functional activation in the left frontal eye
ﬁelds. Farah et al. (2014) used a generalized linear model based multivariate analysis in their research which concluded that white matter abnormalities underlie listening difﬁculties in children suspected
of auditory processing disorders.
4. Discussion
The results of this systematic review demonstrate a remarkably
wide variety of applications of multivariate analysis (MVA) techniques
in neurological developmental disorders in pediatric, neonatal and
fetal populations. Since the ideal combination of MVA technique and
medical imaging derived clinical information is unknown a priori for
applications focused on any given neurodevelopmental disorder, an enormous amount of research is required to fully optimize MVA's potential in
this domain. Recent years have exhibited ample growth in MVA applied
to neurodevelopmental disorders with development in this ﬁeld ongoing.
However, future research growth will be accompanied by substantial
challenges. There are many MVA techniques and technologies available
to the medical researcher and there is a wide array of associated challenges that will contribute to making this an exciting and difﬁcult
research endeavor.
One major obstacle in this application domain is caused by patient
motion which is particularly challenging in children who tend to have
a harder time remaining still during imaging. Children instructed to
remain still in the scanner may forget over the course of the examination.
The problems with patient motion are even more poignant for many
pediatric neurodevelopmental disorders such as ADHD or epilepsy
which make remaining motionless during MRI all the more challenging
for the subject. Image registration is a class of technology used to compensate for patient motion but this is a challenging problem for which no gold
standard accepted solution is available. Spatial registration to standard
templates (or brain atlases) are typically based on the adult brain
(Talairach and Tournoux, 1988) and it has been shown that normalization
procedures used can cause distortions in the brain examinations of
children 6 years old and under (Muzik et al., 2000). Distortional effects
may negatively impact MVA results and so care should be taken to
avoid providing data exhibiting distortional artifacts to MVA technology.
As can be seen from this review, many studies exist that apply MVA to
patient populations prone to movement during image acquisition such
as ADHD and epilepsy. Typically such studies employ image registration
technology to compensate for patient motion, however, it should be
noted that many techniques are available and the methods available are
not perfect and so the use of such technologies are associated with the
introduction of an unknown quantity of experimental error. This
unknown experimental error applies regardless of whether registration
is performed for within-subject motion correction or if registration is

employed to align patient data in a group-wise fashion which may be
accomplished with atlases.
Overﬁtting is an unwanted effect characterized by supervised learning
algorithms that are overly tuned to the training data provided. Overﬁtting
can yield extremely impressive test evaluation metrics while simultaneously not representing a robust test that will perform well on an independent dataset. Thus reported impressive test evaluation metrics in the
literature may be unrealistic if the authors are reporting results based on
an overﬁtted technology. The earliest studies targeting any given developmental condition typically have to rely on only a single dataset due to the
availability of appropriate data. Further testing on independent datasets is
a requisite for advancing an MVA technology beyond preliminary analyses. Additionally, it is known that the number of measurements an MVA
technology relies upon needs to be much smaller than the total number
of samples provided in order to produce robust and reliable results
(Raudys and Jain, 1991). When MVA technologies are provided with an
inappropriately large number of measurements, the input data space is
so large that many MVA techniques might fully or nearly fully separate
the data merely due to the large amount of separation between neighboring samples of any of the classes/groups provided. Thus MVA technologies
are prone to overﬁtting unless the number of measurements is much
lower than the number of samples. Keeping the number of measurements
at one tenth of the total number of samples is a reasonable way to avoid
overﬁtted solutions of this type, which is supported by Raudys and Jain's
seminal analysis on this subject (Raudys and Jain, 1991). Whole brain
analyses performed on a voxel-wise basis are capable of generating thousands of sample measurements per subject. If those distributed measurements from a single subject were truly independent of each other then
the total number of samples will always be very large even for studies
with very few subjects therein and thus might be able to help overcome
creating overﬁtted solutions based on too few samples relative to the
number of measurements. However, caution is warranted in this situation, as a neurodevelopmental disorder can have a similar effect on
multiple voxels, thus providing multiple measurements of the same underlying physiological condition from the same subject. It cannot be guaranteed that such distributed measures actually provide an appropriate
distribution of example measurements to facilitate avoiding producing
overﬁtted solutions. Furthermore, ground truth as to the presence of a
neurodevelopmental disorder is typically known at a subject level (i.e.
patient wide diagnoses) and often not known on a voxel-by-voxel
level (which often requires complicated experiments combining histology and coregistration to MRI). Without voxel-by-voxel ground truth
data, a validation procedure will be unable to separate distributed samples from a subject's brain MRI into tissue representative of neurodevelopmental abnormalities and tissue that is progressing normally.
As such the most reliable approach to validation involves the acquisition
of data from a large cohort of independent subjects.
Additionally, it should be noted that one of the main shortcomings of
the studies presented in this review is that they are evaluated on a single
dataset. Ideally, a system for detecting/diagnosing a given condition
validated on a single dataset would be further validated on an independent dataset so as to avoid the potential for producing unrealistically
high performance metrics due to the computational learning approach
being overly tuned to the nature of the single dataset from which it
was provided training data. This would represent an additional type of
overﬁtted solution. It is unknown how substantial this effect is on any
given study, providing a substantial amount of uncertainty in the interpretation of the ﬁndings presented in this review.
The validation techniques outlined in this study and tabulated in
Tables 1 through 4 are designed to avoid the problem of overﬁtting in
the situation where the researchers only have a single dataset on
which to conduct their research. The most common validation technique employed in this paper's reviewed research studies is leave-oneout (LOO) validation. This technique's main strength lies in its ease of
applicability, particularly when the dataset being evaluated is relatively
small. LOO reserves the largest proportion of data samples for training

541

which is advantageous when very few samples are available. LOO's
shortcomings are linked to the same issue; by providing the largest
percentage of samples for training, LOO will be more prone than alternative validation techniques to yielding an overﬁtted solution excessively
tuned to the large amount of data the machine learning technique was
provided for training. Randomized trials devoting 50% of the dataset to
training and 50% to testing would be an ideal validation process for a single dataset study that contains many samples, however, on small datasets
this validation approach suffers from widely varying performance metrics in each validation iteration, especially when dealing with a heterogeneous dataset which is common in studies of neurodevelopmental
disorders.
While feature selection can be addressed as a class of technology
independent of supervised learning, some supervised learning techniques
incorporate feature selection into their learning procedure while others
do not. Feature selection is particularly important in the characterization,
detection and diagnosis of developmental brain disorders because we
acquire a multitude of measurements distributed across the brain and
we do not know a priori all the regions that are involved in the developmental disorder being investigated. Feature selection can theoretically
improve our understanding of brain development and could lead to
new technologies to assist in the characterization, detection and diagnosis
of a variety of medical conditions as well as to assist in clinical therapeutic
assessment.
While predicting a sample as belonging to a particular group based
on training data is the most common approach to the use of supervised
machine learning algorithms, they can also be adapted to produce a
unidimensional measurement of the severity of a given condition. This
is a very powerful and underdeveloped area of research that allows the
MVA technology to create composite medical images that combine multiple pre-existing images to create useful customized medical images
(based on the use of the machine learning technology in regression
mode, which is in turn closely related to some multivariate statistical
analysis techniques). Examples of customized composite medical images
that can be created with this technology include images of tissue stress,
images of the likelihood of the presence of disease or images of the likelihood of a given region of tissue exhibiting a physiological condition that
could lead to the development of a neurological disorder. An extension
of this idea is to create distributed measures of brain maturity based on
a collection of measurements related to the extent of myelination, MRI
measurements of fractional anisotropy which provides information on
the development of neural ﬁber tracts, etc. Investigating brain maturation
with MVA as outlined is particularly challenging as it is known that T1 &
T2 imaging presentation inverts between the fetal/neonatal stage and the
pediatric stage of development, largely due to myelination in the developing brain (Paus et al., 2001; Pujol et al., 2006; Deoni et al., 2012). Theoretically, MVA techniques should be able to overcome this challenge,
however, conﬁguring MVA to do so reliably is a major research challenge. Such a technology would have the potential to identify patients
deviating from expected growth trajectories which may assist in the
detection, characterization and differential diagnosis of a variety of
neurodevelopmental disorders.
The scientiﬁc literature has seen enormous growth in developmental imaging of pre-adult populations making use of MVA technologies.
However, the vast majority of this work has been focused in pediatric
imaging with considerably less focus on neonatal and fetal imaging.
Neonatal imaging is more challenging as brain size is considerably
smaller than in pediatrics and it is more challenging for technicians to
get a neonate to remain still during their imaging examination. Patient
movement induces multiple types of imaging artifacts as discussed
above, which make studies on neonate populations considerably more
challenging. Fetal imaging is the greatest challenge of the three as the
brain sizes are the smallest and movement remains a major issue. Furthermore, MRI technology is reliant on the spatial proximity of a radiofrequency (RF) coil (antenna) to the tissue/organ being imaged. Normal
brain imaging beneﬁts from a specialized head RF coil that is mounted

immediately adjacent to the subject's cranium, however, in fetal imaging
this is not possible and so coils located outside the mother's abdomen are
necessary, inherently reducing image quality. Additional challenges exist
in fetal imaging due to variations in tissue contrast observed in utero relative to later developmental ages. Regardless of the many challenges inherent in the use of MVA in the imaging of fetal, neonatal and pediatric
populations, there is considerably large potential for ongoing research
growth in this ﬁeld.
5. Conclusions
Multivariate analysis (MVA) technologies can play a useful role in
helping to answer questions about structural and functional organization and development in the brain. Furthermore, MVA techniques
have the potential to better characterize a variety of medical conditions
than a univariate technique can produce alone. MVA technologies have
tremendous potential in the creation of the next generation of clinical
diagnostic tests informed by the large amount of information acquired
by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). MVA technologies have exhibited enormous growth in developmental brain MRI in pre-adult populations with a strong emphasis on pediatric imaging. The technologies
are very ﬂexible and a wide range of potential applications have already
been investigated, however, so many variations on MVA technologies
are available in the scientiﬁc literature that ample research will need
to be performed in order to thoroughly evaluate the tradeoffs imposed
by the selection of a given MVA technique applied to a particular
neurodevelopmental disorder. Future work will look at improving MVA
techniques and adapting them to better characterize, diagnose and detect
neurological developmental disorders in pre-adult populations as well as
to assist in the identiﬁcation of clinical variables associated with important aspects of patient outcome and disease etiology.
