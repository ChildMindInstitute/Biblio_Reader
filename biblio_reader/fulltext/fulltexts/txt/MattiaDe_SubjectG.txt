D. Product Description
D.1. Identity
Chemical name: Phosphatidylserine (PS).
Per IUPAC-CBN nomenclature, it is a 1,2-diacyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-L-serine.
Chemical Abstract Registry Number:
There is no CAS Reg. Number assigned specifically to PS derived from fish lecithin. The generic
CAS Reg. Number assigned to PS is: 84776-79-4.
Chemical Formula: The empirical formula of the most abundant molecule (comprising two
linoleic acids) is C 42 H 73 O 10 PNCa.
Structure: PS consists of a glycerophosphate skeleton conjugated with two fatty acids and Lserine via a phosphodiester linkage. The structural diagram below shows the general
representation of the glycerophosphate backbone with R as fatty acids. The counter ion for the
phosphate moiety is Ca2+.

Figure 1. General structure of PS, where R= alkyl group; The counter ion for the phosphate
moiety is Ca2+ in most abundant form.
Fatty Acid Profile:
The mean percentages of the fatty acids (FA) in PS from various sources are presented in Table 1.
Table 2 presents the FA profile of DHAPSTM. The bovine source is mainly composed of stearic
and oleic acids; the main fatty acids in plant sources have linoleic acid and oleic acid; and fish

2

D.2. Manufacturing Process
DHAPSTM is manufactured from high phosphatidylcholine-enriched herring fish lecithin (DHAlecithin is extracted with ethanol from herring roe). The phosphatidylcholine-enriched lecithin is
enzymatically transphosphatidylated with L-serine using phospholipase D, which catalyzes the
substitution of the choline head-group with serine to form PS. Following the enzymatic reaction,
PS is separated from the reaction mixture, purified, and dried.
ECA’s DHAPSTM is manufactured under current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) using
common food industry materials and processes. ECA uses a Hazard Analysis and Critical
Control Point (HACCP)-controlled manufacturing process and rigorously tests its final
production batches to verify adherence to quality control specifications described below.
D.3. Typical Composition and Specifications
DHAPSTM is produced as an off-white to brown-colored powder. Table 3 presents the typical
composition of DHAPSTM in comparison with those described in other GRNs for PS of soy
origin. Table 4 shows specifications of DHAPSTM. Analysis of pesticides (less than 0.05 ppm)
and dioxin congeners (less than 0.5 ppm) showed that the levels for the pesticides and other
contaminants are minimal in this product. Specifications are comparable to those established in
the previous GRAS notices (GRNs 186, 197, and 223; PS content: GRN 186, >19%; GRN 197,
90%; GRN 223, 72%).
ECA’s product is specified to contain approximately 50% PS. The product also contains other
phospholipids and glycerides naturally occurring in soy lecithin. These other phospholipids
include lysoPS, phosphatidic acid, lysophosphatidic acid, and associated phospholipids.
Compared to other soy PS described in GRNs 197 and 223, specifications of DHAPSTM are 20-40%
4

000007

lower in PS content, but higher in other phospholipids. Compared to soy PS described in GRN
186, DHAPSTM is 30% higher in PS content and lower in other phospholipids. These
phospholipid profiles are not expected to impact the safety profile of PS preparations.

E. Applicable Conditions for Use of the Notified Substance
E.1. Current Regulatory Status
In 2003, the ability of dietary supplementation with PS (both PS derived from soy lecithin and
bovine cortex) to support cognition and interrupt cognitive deterioration was recognized by the
FDA in its approval of the qualified health claim, ‘Consumption of PS may reduce the risk of
dementia in the elderly’, with a disclaimer, ‘Very limited and preliminary scientific research
suggests that phosphatidylserine may reduce the risk of dementia in the elderly’ (FDA, 2003). In
the FDA’s response to this health claim petition, the FDA concluded that the use of PS as a
dietary supplement is safe and lawful under 21 C.F.R. § 101.14 provided that bovine-derived
sources, if used, are not derived from bovine tissues from cattle born, raised, or slaughtered in
any country where bovine spongiform encephalopathy exists.
In addition, the FDA issued no question letters on six GRAS notices (GRN 294) related to food
uses of PS derived from sunflower lecithin (GRN 545; FDA, 2015), soy lecithin (GRNs 186,
197, and 223; FDA 2006a, 2006b, 2007), and marine oil (GRNs 279 and 311; FDA, 2009, 2010).
In these GRAS notices, toxicity-related studies on PS from the literature were presented to
support the safety of utilizing PS. The FDA did not question the acceptability and suitability of
these studies to establish the safety of PS for the revised, proposed food uses. The safety and
related information in the above mentioned GRAS notices is hereby incorporated by reference
into this independent GRAS determination.
E.2. Intended Use Levels and Food Categories
As shown in Table 5, ECA proposes to use DHAPSTM as a nutrient [21 CFR §170.3(o)(20)], and
as an alternative to other sources of PS, at levels up to 100 mg PS per serving in dairy product
analogs (imitation milk and soy milk), grain products (nutritional bars: breakfast, granola, and
protein), milk products (flavored milk and milk drinks, excluding fluid milk, milk-based meal
replacements, and yogurt), and processed fruits and fruit juices (fruit flavored drink), at use
levels of 50 mg PS per serving in breakfast cereals and milk (fluid - regular, filled, buttermilk,
and dry reconstituted), and up to 300 mg in medical foods. Medical foods are defined as foods
that are specially formulated and intended for the dietary management of a disease that has
distinctive nutritional needs that cannot be met by the normal diet alone.
ECA does not intend to use PS as a component of infant formula or in foods under the USDA’s
jurisdiction such as meat, poultry, and egg products.

E.3. Estimated Dietary Intakes (EDIs) of PS Under the Intended Food Uses
Currently, dietary intakes of PS, from its natural presence in the diet, is estimated to be in the
range of 75 to 184 mg/person/day.
Since DHAPS® will be used in the same food categories and at same use levels as those
described in GRN 223 and 186, these exposure calculations presented in those GRNs are valid
for DHAPSTM as well. In these GRNs, the EDIs of PS from soy or sunflower sources under the
intended use was determined using Continuing Survey of Food Intakes by Individuals (CSFII)
1994-96 database (USDA, 1998). The FDA commonly uses the estimated daily intake for the
90th percentile consumer of a food additive as a measure of high chronic dietary intake. Hence,
for the safety determinations, the resulting 90th percentile intakes of PS under the intended uses
are considered.
As noted in GRN 223 and 186, approximately 60% of the total U.S. population was identified as
potential consumers of PS from the proposed food uses. Although infants are included in the
intake determinations, PS is not intended to be used in products such as baby foods or infant
formula that are specifically marketed for use by infants. Consumption of types of food
categories intended for addition of PS by the total U.S. population resulted in estimated mean alluser intakes of PS of 44.8 mg/person/day (0.95 mg/kg body weight [bw]/day. When heavy
consumers (90th percentile) were assessed, the 90th percentile all-user intakes of PS from all
intended food uses by the total population were 98.7 mg/person/day (2.51 mg/kg bw/day). A
7

000010

summary of the estimated daily intakes of PS from the intended food categories is presented in
Table 6.
These estimates are highly optimistic since all foods under the intended uses will not be used at
the maximum use levels. Based on the totality of the science and as discussed below, these intake
levels are considered safe.

E.4. Basis for the GRAS Determination
The subject of the present GRAS assessment is DHAPSTM, PS derived from fish lecithin. PS, a
structural component of cells, is found in all biological membranes of plants, animals, and other
life forms. FDA has received several GRAS Notices for PS derived from different sources. As
the specifications in this GRAS determination are similar to the specifications in the previous
FDA GRAS notices, it is recognized that the information and data in the GRAS notices received,
and reviewed, by FDA are pertinent to the safety of the fish PS product in this GRAS
determination. Therefore, this notice incorporates by reference the safety and metabolism
studies and other pertinent information of PS discussed in GRNs 279 and 311 (fish PS; FDA,
2009, 2010). In addition, as fish PS and PS derived from sunflower and soy sources follow a
similar metabolic pathway, this notice also incorporates by reference the safety and metabolism
studies and other pertinent information discussed in GRN 545 (soy PS, GRN 183, 197, and 223,
FDA, 2006a, 2006b, 2007; sunflower PS, FDA, 2015).
The intended use of fish PS (DHAPSTM) has been determined to be safe though scientific
procedures as set forth in 21 CFR 170.3(b), thus satisfying the so-called “technical” element of
the Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS) determination. In addition, because this safety
evaluation was based on generally available and widely accepted data and information, it also
satisfies the so-called “common knowledge” element of a GRAS determination.
Technical Element (Safety) of the GRAS Determination
8

000011

Numerous human and animal studies have reported benefits of PS with no major adverse effects.
ECA uses a HACCP-controlled manufacturing process and rigorously tests its final production
batches to verify adherence to quality control specifications. There is broad-based and widely
disseminated knowledge concerning the chemistry of PS. This GRAS determination is based on
the data and information generally available and consented opinion about the safety of PS from a
fish source. The literature indicates that PS offers consumers benefits without adverse effects.
PS, a structural component of cells, is found in all biological membranes of plants, animals, and
other life forms. FDA has received six GRAS Notices for PS derived from different sources
(GRN 186, 197, 223, 279, 311, and 545). In each case, the FDA responded that they had no
questions on the proposed use and did not object to the respective GRAS determination. In
particular, the FDA had no questions on the safety of PS derived from soy when PS content
ranged from 19 to 90% (GRNs 186, 197, and 223).
The following safety evaluation fully considers the composition, intake, nutritional,
microbiological, and toxicological properties of PS as well as appropriate corroborative data.
ECA’s DHAPSTM is manufactured under current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) using
common food industry materials and processes. Analytical data from multiple lots indicate that
DHAPSTM complies reliably with the established food-grade product specifications and meet all
applicable purity standards.
1. PS is an endogenous substance found in the human body. The bioavailability of
the ingested PS is limited due to extensive hydrolysis in the intestine prior to
absorption, and that absorbed PS is transported and rapidly converted into other
endogenous constituents.
2. Historical consumption of PS supports the safety of PS. PS is commonly found in
common foods such as meat, fish, legumes, etc. PS has been marketed as a dietary
supplement for the past two decades without any adverse effects (except
gastrointestinal side effects such as nausea and indigestion).
3. Multiple human clinical studies with various subjects reported that oral
administration of PS at doses of 100 to 800 mg/day did not result in any adverse
effect regardless of its origin. In particular, the safety of PS has been confirmed at
daily doses of up to 300 mg for up to 6 months (Hellhammer et al., 2004, 2012,
2014; Jorissen et al., 2001, 2002; Appendix A). The safety of PS has been proven
in human clinical studies including susceptible groups (elderly and children) and
healthy individuals. These studies employed PS derived from bovine cortex, soy,
or marine sources. The available scientific evidence indicates that PS derived
from fish lecithin is toxicologically equivalent to PS naturally found in the diet or
derived from bovine cortex or soy.
4. A variety of animal toxicity studies and in vitro mutagenicity/genotoxicity studies
corroborate the human clinical safety data (Appendix B). The animal studies did
not show any significant toxicity at doses up to approximately 1,000 mg/kg/day
(Heywood, 1987).
9

000012

5. ECA proposes to use a standardized PS derived from fish lecithin (DHAPSTM) as a
nutrient at levels up to 100 mg PS per serving in dairy product analogs (imitation
milk and soy milk), grain products (nutritional bars: breakfast, granola, and
protein), milk products (flavored milk and milk drinks excluding fluid milk, milkbased meal replacements, and yogurt), and processed fruits and fruit juices (fruit
flavored drink), at use levels of 50 mg PS per serving in breakfast cereals and
milk (fluid - regular, filled, buttermilk, and dry reconstituted), and up to 300 mg
in medical foods. The intended use levels and food categories are the same as
those for soy- and sunflower-derived PS which was the subject of GRNs 223 and
545. Thus, the exposure to PS from DHAPSTM will be the same as that described
for GRNs 223 and 545, i.e., 98.7 mg/person/day which is well below the safe
levels of intake for humans at 300 mg PS per person per day. The EDI estimates
are based on the assumption that DHAPSTM will replace currently marketed PS
derived from various sources. Thus, no increase in exposures is expected.
6. Additional studies published subsequent to the FDA GRAS notices continue to
support the safety of PS as a food ingredient (Hellhammer et al., 2014; Lifshitz et
al., 2015; Vakhapova et al., 2014).
7. The FDA has agreed to exercise enforcement discretion with a Qualified Health
Claim Petition on PS. The petitioner in this submission demonstrated that fishderived PS is safe at levels up to 500 mg/day.
8. The compositional data and product properties are consistent with carefully
controlled cGMP production and purification. ECA’s DHAPS® preparation
contains no impurities or contaminants of concern.
Based on the above-described data and information, we conclude that DHAPSTM, when used as a
nutrient, is reasonably expected to be safe. Additionally, ECA has conducted an updated
literature search since 2014. ECA did not uncover any additional information that is relevant to
the use of PS.
Common Knowledge Element of a GRAS Determination
FDA notes that general recognition of safety requires common knowledge about the substance
throughout the scientific community knowledgeable about the safety of substances directly or
indirectly added to food. The two following components meet a common knowledge element of
a GRAS determination:
1. Data and information related to safety are generally available, and this has been
established by utilizing published, peer-reviewed scientific journals, and
2. PS has been evaluated by FDA and several expert groups and found to be safe for use in
food. In addition, there is consensus among qualified scientists about the safety of the
substance for its intended use.

10

000013

Because this safety evaluation was based on generally available and widely accepted data and
information and there was consensus among qualified scientists about the safety of PS for its
intended use, it also satisfies the "common knowledge" element of a GRAS determination.
Additionally, ECA has conducted an updated literature search since 2014. ECA did not uncover
an additional information that is relevant to the use of PS.
F. Allergen Labeling
ECA is aware that the Food Allergen Labeling and Consumer Protection Act of 2004 (FALCPA)
amends the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to require that the label of a food that is or
contains an ingredient that bears or contains a "major food allergen" declare the presence of the
allergen (section 403(w)). FALCPA defines a "major food allergen" as one of eight foods or food
groups (milk, eggs, fish, Crustacean shellfish, tree nuts, peanuts, wheat, and soybeans) or a food
ingredient that contains protein derived from one of those foods. ECA will ensure that its PS will
be appropriately labeled in full compliance with the Food Allergen Labeling and Consumer
Protection Act of 2004 (Title I1 of Public Law 108-282). Appendix C shows that ECS’s
DHAPSTM is free of allergens.

GENERALLY RECOGNIZED AS SAFE (GRAS) DETERMINATION FOR
THE ADDITION OF PHOSPHATIDYLSERINE (PS) DERIVED FROM
FISH LECITHIN TO FOODS
I. INTRODUCTION
The undersigned, an independent panel of recognized experts (hereinafter referred to as
the Expert Panel), qualified by their scientific training and relevant national and international
experience to evaluate the safety of food and food ingredients, was convened by NutraSource,
Inc., at the request of ECA Healthcare, Inc. (hereinafter referred to as ECA), to determine the
Generally Recognized As Safe (GRAS) status of its phosphatidylserine (PS) from fish lecithin
(DHAPSTM) as a nutritional food ingredient as defined in 21 CFR§170.3(o)(20) in foods. A
comprehensive search of the scientific literature for safety and toxicity information on PS was
conducted and made available to the Expert Panel members. The Expert Panel members
independently and critically evaluated materials submitted by ECA and other information
deemed appropriate or necessary. ECA Healthcare assures that all published and unpublished
safety-related information in its possession and relevant to the subject of this safety assessment
has been provided to NutraSource, Inc. and has been accurately summarized in this GRAS
monograph. Following an independent, critical evaluation, the Expert Panel unanimously agreed
to the decision described herein.
The purpose of this dossier is to (1) Outline the identity and composition of DHAPSTM, (2)
Estimate exposure under the intended use, (3) Document the literature pertaining to the safety,
toxicity, and food uses of PS, and (4) Assemble an independent expert panel of recognized
experts to evaluate the data and information in this document to determine if the document is
sufficient to establish GRAS status.
The data and information summarized in this dossier demonstrate that the intended use of
DHAPSTM, produced using current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) and meeting foodgrade specifications, is GRAS, based on scientific procedures, as described herein.
II. INFORMATION ABOUT THE IDENTITY OF THE GRAS SUBSTANCE
II.A. Background
Phosphatidylserine (PS) is the major acidic phospholipid class that accounts for 13–15 % of the
phospholipids in the human cerebral cortex (Glade and Smith, 2015; Kim et al., 2014). The
human body contains about 30 g of PS, about half (approximately 13 g) of which is found in the
brain. PS plays a vital role in several metabolic processes such as activation of cell-membrane
bound enzymes and is involved in neuronal signaling. In the plasma membrane, PS is localized
exclusively in the cytoplasmic leaflet where it forms part of the protein docking sites necessary
for the activation of several key signaling pathways (Kim et al., 2014).
Dietary PS supplements are known to improve cognitive function, mood, and stress management
in humans and experimental animals, and the intake of PS has been associated with an
4

000030

DHAPS™

improvement of psychiatric disorders, such as bipolar and major depressive disorders, as well as
the prevention of inflammatory neurodegenerative events (Glade and Smith, 2015). Aging of the
human brain is associated with biochemical alterations and structural deterioration that impair
neurotransmission. Exogenous PS (300-800 mg/day) safely slows, halts, or reverses biochemical
alterations and structural deterioration in nerve cells (Glade and Smith, 2015). It also supports
locomotor functions, especially rapid reactions and reflexes (Glade and Smith, 2015). Moreover,
in combination with phosphatidic acid (PA), PS has been shown to reduce cortisol levels and
enhance well-being under acute social stress (Hellhammer et al., 2004, 2014).
In this GRAS assessment, PS is intended to be used as an alternative to the currently marketed
PS from soy, sunflower, and other sources, that are used as nutritional ingredients for foods and
medical foods for the general population. Thus, the overall exposure to PS is not expected to
increase as a result of the introduction of DHAPS™ onto the market.
The FDA has issued no question letters on six GRAS notices related to food uses of PS derived
from soy lecithin (GRNs 186, 197 and 223), sunflower lecithin (GRN 545), and marine oil
lecithin (GRN 279 and 311). In these GRAS notices, toxicity-related studies on PS from the
literature were presented to support the safety of utilizing PS. The FDA did not question the
acceptability and suitability of these studies to establish the safety of PS derived from various
sources. The safety and related information in the above mentioned GRAS notices is hereby
incorporated by reference to this independent GRAS determination.
III. CLAIM OF GRAS STATUS
III.A. Claim of Exemption from the Requirement for Premarket Approval Requirements
Pursuant to Proposed 21 CFR § 170.36(c)(1)
Phosphatidylserine, derived from a marine source (fish), for use as a nutrient, has been
determined to be Generally Recognized As Safe (GRAS) and, therefore, is exempt from the
requirement of premarket approval, under the conditions of its intended use as described below.
The basis for this finding is described in the following sections.
III.B. Common or Trade Name:
Common name is phosphatidylserine (PS). Trade name is DHAPSTM, manufactured by ECA
Healthcare, Inc.

III.E. Manufacturing Process
DHAPSTM is manufactured from high phosphatidylcholine-enriched herring fish lecithin (DHAlecithin is extracted with ethanol from herring roe). The phosphatidylcholine-enriched lecithin is
enzymatically transphosphatidylated with L-serine using a phospholipase enzyme. The enzyme
used for transphosphatidylation is derived from a microorganism that is nonpathogenic and
nontoxicogenic. This enzymatic process catalyzes the substitution of the choline head-group with
serine to form phosphatidylserine. The enzyme treatment does not alter the fatty acids attached to
the molecule or its stereochemistry. Following the enzymatic reaction, the solid product is
separated from the reaction mixture, purified and dried. A final blending with approved foodgrade excipients, including silicon dioxide, is carried out in order to produce a free-flowing
powder. Processing aids used, such as ethyl alcohol, are food grade quality as specified in Food
Chemical Codex (FCC). ECA’s DHAPSTM is manufactured under current Good Manufacturing
Practices (cGMP) using common food industry materials and processes.

ECA uses a Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point (HACCP)-controlled manufacturing
process and rigorously tests its final production batches to verify adherence to quality control
specifications. Processing aids, such as ethanol and other ingredients including excipients used in
the manufacturing process are food grade as specified in Food Chemical Codex. The ECA
manufacturing facility and process are certified with National Science Foundation International,
based in Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA.
III.F. Typical Composition and Specifications
DHAPSTM is produced as a yellow to brown cream. The typical composition and specifications
are shown in Tables 3 and 4, respectively. Analytical data from five different manufacturing lots
are presented in Appendix A. Analysis of pesticides (less than 0.05 ppm) and dioxin congeners
(less than 0.5 ppm) showed that the levels for pesticides and other contaminants are minimal in
this product. Specifications are comparable to those established in the previous GRAS notices for
impurities although the PS concentration is lower in DHAPSTM (PS content: GRN 279, 48%;
GRN 311, >55%; ECA, >30%). Analytical data from multiple lots indicate that DHAPSTM
complies reliably with the established food-grade product specifications and meet all applicable
purity standards.
The product also contains other phospholipids naturally occurring in fish oil. These other
phospholipids include lysoPS, phosphatidic acid, lyso phosphatidic acid, and associated
phospholipids. FA profiles include docosahexaenoic acid (DHA; C22:6n-3; 20%), and
eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA; C20:5n-3; 6%).

IV. INTENDED USES AND EXPOSURE ESTIMATES
IV.A. Intended Technical Effects
DHAPSTM is intended for use in powder form as a nutritional ingredient to provide a
supplementary source of PS in consumers' diets. While there is no specified Dietary Reference
Intake (DRI) level for PS, intake of PS via food sources has been shown to be beneficial for
brain function. Although PS is naturally present in the diet, such as in certain fish, poultry, and
meats (especially organ meats), using it to supplement food is gaining attention due to its
potential health benefits.
IV.B. Intended Use
As shown in Table 5, ECA proposes to use DHAPSTM as a nutrient [21 CFR §170.3(o)(20)], and
as an alternative to soy or sunflower PS, at levels up to 100 mg PS per serving in dairy product
analogs (imitation milk and soy milk), grain products (nutritional bars: breakfast, granola, and
protein), milk products (flavored milk and milk drinks excluding fluid milk, milk-based meal
replacements, and yogurt), and processed fruits and fruit juices (fruit flavored drink), at use
levels of 50 mg PS per serving in breakfast cereals and milk (fluid - regular, filled, buttermilk,
and dry reconstituted), and up to 300 mg in medical foods. Medical foods are defined as foods
that are specially formulated and intended for the dietary management of a disease that has
distinctive nutritional needs that cannot be met by the normal diet alone.

ECA does not intend to use PS as a component of infant formula or in foods under the USDA’s
jurisdiction such as meat, poultry, and egg products.

IV.C. Estimated Daily Intakes (EDI) under the Intended Use

IV.C.1. Intake from Natural Presence in Food
PS is found in small amounts in foods such as meats, eggs, soy products, certain legumes, and
milk. Dietary intake of PS, from its natural presence in the diet, is estimated to be in the range of
75 to 184 mg/person/day (Bruni et al., 1989; FDA, 2006b; Hamm, 2004). Although some foods
with standards of identity are included in the list of foods, at present the use of DHAPS™ is
intended for foods without a standard of identity.
IV.C.2. EDIs under the Intended Uses
Since DHAPS™ will be used in the same food categories and at same use levels as those
described in GRN 223 and 545, the exposure calculations presented in those GRNs are valid for
DHAPS™ as well (Table 6). In these GRNs, the EDIs of PS from soy or sunflower sources
under the intended use was determined using the Continuing Survey of Food Intakes by
Individuals (CSFII) 1994-96 database (USDA, 1998). The FDA commonly uses the estimated
daily intake for the 90th percentile consumer of a food additive as a measure of high chronic
dietary intake. Hence, for the safety determinations, the resulting 90th percentile intakes of PS
under the intended uses are considered.
11

000037

DHAPS™

As noted in GRN 223 and 545, approximately 60% of the total U.S. population was identified as
potential consumers of PS from the proposed food uses. Although infants are included in the
intake determinations, PS is not intended to be used in products such as baby foods or infant
formula that are specifically marketed for use by infants. Consumption of types of food
categories intended for addition of PS by the total U.S. population resulted in estimated mean alluser intakes of PS of 44.8 mg/person/day (0.95 mg/kg body weight [bw]/day). When heavy
consumers (90th percentile) were assessed, the 90th percentile all-user intakes of PS from all
intended food-uses by the total population was 98.7 mg/person/day (2.51 mg/kg bw/day). A
summary of the estimated daily intake of PS from the intended food categories is presented in
Table 6. These estimates are highly optimistic since all foods under the intended uses will not be
used at the maximum use levels. Based on the totality of science, and the information discussed
below, these intake levels are considered safe.

V. BASIS FOR GRAS DETERMINATION
V.A. Current Regulatory Status
In 2003, the ability of dietary supplementation with PS (both PS derived from bovine cortex
and soybean lecithin) to support cognition and interrupt cognitive deterioration was
recognized by the FDA in its approval of the qualified health claim, ‘Consumption of PS
may reduce the risk of dementia in the elderly’, with a disclaimer, ‘Very limited and
preliminary scientific research suggests that phosphatidylserine may reduce the risk of
dementia in the elderly’ (FDA, 2003). In the FDA’s response to this health claim petition,
the FDA concluded that the use of PS as a dietary supplement is safe and lawful under 21
C.F.R. § 101.14 provided that bovine-derived sources, if used, are not derived from bovine
tissues from cattle born, raised, or slaughtered in any country where bovine spongiform
encephalopathy exists.
In addition, the FDA has issued no question letters on six GRAS notices related to food uses
of PS derived from soy lecithin (GRNs 186, 197, and 223), sunflower lecithin (GRN 545),
and marine oil (GRN 279 and 311). In these GRAS notices, toxicity-related studies on PS
12

000038

DHAPS™

from the literature were presented to support the safety of utilizing PS. The FDA did not
question the acceptability and suitability of these studies to establish the safety of PS for the
revised, proposed food uses. The safety and related information in the above mentioned
GRAS notices is hereby incorporated by reference into this independent GRAS
determination.

Present GRAS assessment: PS derived from fish lecithin; Intended use –same as GRNs 223
and 545. ECA-Healthcare, China.
V.B. Review of Safety Data
As noted above, the FDA has issued ‘no question’ letters on 6 GRAS notices of PS
regardless of its origin. As the specifications in this GRAS determination are similar to
those noted in the FDA GRAS notices (although the concentration of PS in DHAPS™ is
lower than those of the previous notices) and fatty acid (FA) profiles do not impact the
safety of PS, it is recognized that the information and data in the GRAS notices are pertinent
to the safety of the PS product in this GRAS determination. Therefore, this notice
incorporates by reference the safety and metabolism studies discussed in GRN 545 and the
other 5 GRAS notices. The subject of the present GRAS assessment is PS from fish (a
marine source) (powder form). Additionally, this GRAS determination discusses additional
human studies that have been published since the FDA’s last GRAS notice review of 20142015.
V.B.1. Absorption, Metabolism, and Excretion
Following dietary ingestion of PS, pancreatic digestive enzymes cleave specific FAs. The fatty
acids on phospholipids (PLs) are absorbed and transported differently than FA on triglycerides
(TGs). FAs esterified in the sn-2 position are hydrolyzed by pancreatic digestive enzymes,
especially pancreatic phospholipase A2 (Arnesjo et al., 1969). The lysophosphatidylserine (lysoPS) and fatty acids thus formed are absorbed by the mucosal cells of the intestine. The absorbed
lysophospholipids could be reacylated into PS. The fatty acids released can be further used for
triglyceride (TG) synthesis (Tso, 1994). Because of the high activity of decarboxylases in the
mucosal cells, the majority of the PS is converted into other phospholipids. PS is decarboxylated
mainly to phosphatidylethanolamine (Wise and Elwyn, 1965). The reacylated PS,
phosphatidylethanolamine, and other phospholipids enter the lymph and circulation, and are
redistributed. Available evidence indicates that only part of the ingested PS reaches systemic
circulation as part of the phospholipid pool.
Pharmacokinetic studies of PS in rats and mice show good bioavailability. After oral
administration to rats, most of the isotope label recovered from blood samples remained
identifiable as PS for up to 60 min after administration. After 24 h, metabolites were recovered
from blood almost exclusively, mainly as lysophosphatidylethanolamine and
lysophosphatidylcholine (Toffano et al., 1987). For all routes of administration, approximately
60% of the ingested PS is excreted in feces, while 10% is eliminated in urine. When radiolabeled
PS is administered (orally or intraperitoneally) in animals, the radioactivity recovered in the
urine was mainly metabolized (water soluble), whereas the 60-65% of fecal radioactivity was
mainly associated with lipids. The major metabolite recovered in the feces was lysoPS (about
50%) after oral administration (Toffano et al., 1987).
Although FA composition between bovine cortex-, soy-, marine-, or sunflower-derived PS
differs, these differences are unlikely to affect the safety profile. Most of toxicity/safety studies
were done on fish PS, BCPS (bovine source), and soy PS, which were found to be safe.

DHAPS™

Compared to saturated FA present in bovine source, unsaturated FA present in plant sources are
not expected to have more adverse effects. BCPS primarily contains saturated and
monounsaturated fatty acids, as well as some DHA and fish-derived PS mainly contains omega-3
polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) and saturated FA. Sunflower- and soy-derived PS mainly
contain PUFA. Thus, the human studies of PS derived from bovine cortex, marine, and soy
sources can be used for the safety evaluation of PS from fish lecithin.
V.B.2. Mutagenicity and Genotoxicity Studies
Historically, PS is derived from animal sources such as bovine cortex. In recent years, because of
potential contamination concerns from bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) prions, other
sources of PS such as plant and marine sources have been explored. As noted above, these
differences in FA profiles are unlikely to affect the safety profile of PS, regardless of its origin.
The mutagenic potential of PS derived from marine or bovine cortex (BCPS) was investigated in
human lymphocytes, chromosomal damage assays, mouse-lymphoma cell mutation tests,
cultured human epithelial cell DNA repair assays, and/or in an in vivo mouse micronucleus assay
(Heywood et al., 1987). It is concluded that marine PS or BCPC is not genotoxic or clastogenic
under the conditions described below. A recent study by Lifshitz et al. (2015) confirmed that PS
from fish source was not mutagenic or genotoxic.
Bacterial reverse mutation assay of PS-DHA
A mutagenic potential of fish PS conjugated to DHA (PS-DHA) was tested (Lifshitz et al., 2015).
PS-DHA contained 81% phospholipids of which PS comprised 49%. The FA profile reflects the
fish lecithin source, comprising approximately15% DHA and 7.5% EPA. PS-DHA was shown
not to be mutagenic in either the bacterial reverse mutation assay or the human lymphocyte
micronucleus assay. In the bacterial reverse mutation assay, PS-DHA was tested for mutagenic
activity in the Ames test using the histidine-requiring S. typhimurium strains TA 1535, TA 1537,
TA 98, and TA 100 and in the tryptophan-requiring E. coli strain WP2 uvrA in both the absence
and presence of S9-mix. In these tests, PS-DHA did not induce any dose-related increases in the
mean number of revertant colonies.
Cultured human lymphocyte micronucleus assay
PS-DHA was examined for its potential to induce micronuclei in cultured binucleated human
lymphocytes, in both the absence and presence of a metabolic activation system (S9-mix)
(Lifshitz et al., 2015). In this in vitro mammalian cell micronucleus test, blood obtained from
two different donors was used and ethanol was used as a solvent for the test substance. The final
concentrations of the test substance in the culture medium ranged from 0.39 to 200 μg/ml.
Cytotoxicity was determined from Cytokinesis-Block Proliferation Index (CBPI). The results
obtained from the two in vitro micronucleus tests at doses up to 200 μg/ml demonstrated that PSDHA was not clastogenic and/or aneugenic to cultured human lymphocytes.
V.B.3. Animal Toxicity Studies
Traditional toxicity studies were done on BCPS and marine PS containing DHA (Table 7).

Rat (fish PS)
The safety of fish PS conjugated to DHA (PS-DHA) was examined in a subchronic toxicity
study with an in-utero exposure phase (Lifshitz et al., 2015). The study design consisted of two
phases: (1) an in utero exposure phase in which the F0 parents were fed the test or control diets
starting four weeks prior to mating and continued throughout mating, gestation, and lactation
until the weaning of the F1 rats, and (2) a traditional 90-day feeding study in which selected F1
offspring consumed the same diets as did the F0 generation rats. Rats were exposed to diets
containing 1.5%, 3%, or 4.5% PS-DHA or two control diets. Test ingredients used in this study
comprised 81% phospholipids of which PS comprised 49%. The FA profile reflects the fish
lecithin source, comprising approximately15% DHA and 7.5% EPA. Parental (F0) animals were
fed throughout mating, gestation, and lactation. Subsequently, a subchronic, 13-week study was
conducted on the F1 animals followed by 4 weeks of recovery.
F0 rats (Lifshitz et al., 2015): No significant toxicological findings were found in the F0 rats or
the F1 pups. The overall clinical condition and behavior were not adversely affected by the test
substance, and none of the parent rats died as a result of the test material. Gross examination of
the females did not reveal any effect of the test substance on the maternal organs or tissues.
There were no treatment-related clinical signs during the pre-mating, post-mating, gestation, or
lactation periods. There were no noticeable differences between the treatment groups and the
controls in pre-coital time, male or female fertility index, or the number of pregnant females.
There were no statistically significant differences among the treatment groups and the controls in
duration of gestation, and the gestation index was 100% in all groups. There were no statistically
significant differences in body weights and food intake during the pre-mating, post-mating,
gestation, or lactation periods among the groups. Macroscopic examination of the F0 rats did not
reveal any treatment-related abnormalities.
All pregnant females bore live pups, and the numbers of females with stillborn pups were
comparable among groups. There were no noticeable differences in live birth index, viability
index, pup mortality, sex ratio, prenatal loss, perinatal loss, or lactation index.
F1 rats (Lifshitz et al., 2015): In this subchronic study, the PS-DHA-fed F1 rats did not show any
treatment-related changes in neurobehavioral observations, ophthalmoscopy, growth, or food or
water intake. In addition, there were no treatment-related abnormalities in clinical signs and
hematology, or clinical chemistry. At the end of the treatment period, cholesterol, phospholipid,
and triglyceride concentrations were decreased in males and females of the mid-dose, high-dose,
and reference control group (fed 3% soy lecithin + 1.7% DHA). These decreases in plasma lipids
were expected and are ascribed to the lipid-lowering effects of PUFA. No significant changes
were observed in urinary volume or density, either at the end of the treatment period or the
recovery period. At the end of the treatment period, the absolute weights of the spleens were
significantly increased in the females of the mid- and high-dose groups, while the relative spleen
weight was statistically significantly increased in the females of the high-dose group. Many
authors have reported increased spleen weights without corroborating histopathological findings
in mice and rats administered polyunsaturated fatty acids. In the absence of histopathological
changes, increased spleen weights are generally considered to represent physiological or
metabolic responses to PUFA’s rather than adverse responses.

DHAPS™

In this 13-week study, an increase in the presence of renal minimal-mild multifocal
corticomedullary mineralization was noted in nine females of the high-dose group. This change
was not associated with any inflammatory or degenerative changes in the kidneys. One female of
the reference group showed multifocal corticomedullary mineralization. This finding was still
observed at the end of the recovery period in all four surviving females of the high-dose recovery
group. Focal mineralization was noted in five reference control females, one control, and one
mid-dose female and three low-dose females. The animals’ multifocal mineralization was not
accompanied by renal degeneration, cellular necrosis, or any other morphological, biochemical
or physiological changes. In addition, mineralization of the kidneys at the corticomedullary
junction (nephrocalcinosis) is a frequent finding in rats. Female rats appear to be more
susceptible to this phenomenon than males. The findings in the current study are consistent with
an exacerbation of a physiological process that occurs in the female Wistar rat (Rao, 2002) and
based on the historical control data. Another possible explanation for this finding was dietinduced nephrocalcinosis. A low molar ratio of dietary calcium to phosphorus (Ca:P molar ratio
of less than 1) is the most likely cause of nephrocalcinosis associated with semi-purified or
commercial diets (Rao, 2002). PS-DHA contains a relatively high amount of phosphorus. Based
on the above, there is no clear explanation for the nephrocalcinosis, but it cannot be ruled out as
either strain susceptibility or diet-induced.
The NOAEL in this study was determined at 3% of the diet (mid-dose group), equivalent to an
overall intake of at least 2,100 mg/kg bw/day for PS-DHA or 850 mg/kg bw/day for PS (98%
purity) in the F1 generation (Lifshitz et al., 2015).
Studies References in Previous GRNs
The acute oral LD 50 of PS was determined to be greater than 5 g/kg bw and subchronic studies
found the NOAEL of PS as 1,000 mg/kg bw/day in rats and dogs (Heywood et al., 1987). In
addition, PS was not teratogenic in rats and rabbits (Heywood et al., 1987): results of
teratogenicity studies at doses up to 200 mg/kg bw/day in rats and at doses up to 450 mg/kg/day
in rabbits show that oral administration of PS did not affect embryonic and fetal development or
reproductive performances.

V.B.4. Human Clinical Studies
As discussed in section IV.B.2., this document also incorporates by reference the information
and data included in the previous GRN reports. Additionally, this GRAS determination
discusses additional human studies (Hellhammer et al., 2014; Vakhapova et al., 2014) that have
been published since the FDA’s last GRAS notice review of 2014-2015.
Recent Studies Published Since FDA’s Last Review of 2014-2015
Vakhapova et al. (2011) reported improvements in cognitive performance observed in
nondemented elderly individuals with memory complaints after 15 weeks of daily
supplementation with 300 mg of fish PS enriched with 76 mg DHA (PS-DHA). A follow-up
study by Vakhapova et al. (2014) reported that continued dietary supplementation with 100
mg/day of fish PS enriched with 26 mg DHA/day for another 15 weeks sustained improved
cognitive performance in nondemented elderly individuals with memory complaints.
In a study by Hellhammer et al. (2014), in combination with phosphatidic acid (PA, 200 mg), soy
PS (200 mg/day) has been shown to reduce cortisol levels and enhance well-being under acute
social stress in young healthy males who consumed PAS (200 mg PS+200 mg PA) for 42 days.
No significant adverse effects of soy PS were reported.
Studies Referenced in Previous GRNs
In addition to the absence of reports in the published scientific literature of adverse reactions
concerning oral supplementation with PS, the safety of dietary supplementation with PS has been
demonstrated in many human clinical trials. The objective of the majority of these studies was to
examine the effect of PS in reducing the symptoms of dementia and cognitive dysfunction in
geriatric individuals, as well as improvement of cognitive functions in elderly and attention
deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) symptoms in children.

PS derived from fish lecithin (fish PS or PS-DHA)

DHAPS™

Due to safety concerns of the risk for prion contamination in BCPS, fish-derived PS has been
established as a safe alternative in the past two decades. Marine PS is known to improve
cognitive functions in the elderly with various age-related cognitive problems (Table 8-1; Manor
et al., 2013; Richter et al., 2011; Vaisman et al., 2008; Vakhapova et al., 2011, 2014). Children
with ADHD also benefited from marine PS supplementation (Manor et al., 2013; Vaisman et al.,
2008). No adverse effects of PS derived from fish were reported on measured outcomes. Daily
doses of 300 mg PS enriched with DHA were well tolerated when tested for up to 15 weeks in
both children with ADHD and elderly with memory complaints (Vakhapova et al., 2011;
Vaisman et al., 2008). None of the studies listed above reported adverse effects of PS-DHA on
measured outcomes.
PS derived from soy lecithin (soy PS)
Due to safety concerns of the risk for prion contamination in BCPS, soybean-derived PS (soy
PS) was established as a safe alternative in the past two decades (Baumeister et al., 2008; Benton
et al., 2001; Hellhammer et al., 2004, 2012; Hirayama et al., 2014; Jager et al., 2007; Jorissen et
al., 2001, 2002; Kato Kataoka et al., 2010; Parker et al., 2011; Richter et al., 2010, 2013;
Schreiber et al., 2000; Starks et al., 2008). All of the studies described above reported no adverse
effects of PS in healthy subjects and patients with cognitive decline, or memory impairment.
None of the studies reported adverse effects of PS on measured outcomes when PS was
administered at daily doses up to 600 mg for 3-6 months (Jorissen et al., 2001, 2002). In
addition, no adverse events were associated with PS supplementation.
PS from bovine source (BCPS)
Human clinical studies on oral BCPS have employed daily doses of 100 to 800 mg, with the
duration of 10 days to 6 months in elderly patients with various age-related cognitive problems
(Allegro et al., 1987; Amaducci et al., 1988; Caffarra et al., 1987; Cenacchi et al., 1987, 1993;
Crook et al., 1991, 1992, 1996; Delwaide et al., 1986; Engel et al., 1992; Funfgeld et al., 1989;
Granata and Di, 1987; Heiss et al., 1993, 1994; Maggioni et al., 1990; Monteleone et al., 1992;
Palmieri et al., 1987; Puca et al., 1987; Rabboni et al., 1990; Sinforiani et al., 1987; Villardita et
al., 1987). Most studies of BCPS were conducted in 1980s and 1990s. None of the studies listed
above reported adverse effects of PS on measured outcomes.
Other Safety Concern
ECA is aware that the Food Allergen Labeling and Consumer Protection Act of 2004 (FALCPA)
amends the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to require that the label of a food that is or
contains an ingredient that bears or contains a "major food allergen" declare the presence of the
allergen (section 403(w)). FALCPA defines a "major food allergen" as one of eight foods or food
groups (milk, eggs, fish, Crustacean shellfish, tree nuts, peanuts, wheat, and soybeans) or a food
ingredient that contains protein derived from one of those foods. ECA will ensure that its PS will
be appropriately labeled in full compliance with the Food Allergen Labeling and Consumer
Protection Act of 2004 (Title I1 of Public Law 108-282). Appendix C shows that ECS’s
DHAPSTM is free of allergens.

VI. SUMMARY
PS, a structural component of cells, is found in all biological membranes of plants, animals, and
other life forms. PS has been the subject of six GRAS notices submitted to the FDA for use as a
nutrient. In each case, the FDA responded that they had no questions on the proposed use and did
not object to the respective GRAS determination.
ECA proposes to use a standardized marine derived PS (DHAPSTM) as a nutrient at levels up to
100 mg PS per serving in dairy product analogs (imitation milk and soy milk), grain products
(nutritional bars: breakfast, granola, and protein), milk products (flavored milk and milk drinks,
excluding fluid milk, milk-based meal replacements, and yogurt), and processed fruits and fruit
juices (fruit flavored drink), at use levels of 50 mg PS per serving in breakfast cereals and milk
(fluid - regular, filled, buttermilk, and dry reconstituted), and up to 300 mg in medical foods. The
intended use levels and food categories are the same as those for soy- and sunflower-PS which
were the subject of GRAS Notice Numbers 223 and 545. Thus, the exposure to PS from
DHAPSTM will be the same as that described for GRNs 223 and 545, i.e., 98.7 mg/person/day
which is well below the safe levels of intake for humans at 300 mg PS per person per day. The
EDI estimates are based on the assumption that DHAPSTM will replace currently marketed PS
derived from various sources. Thus, cumulative exposures are not expected to change.
Multiple human clinical studies with various subjects reported that oral administration of PS at
doses of 100 to 800 mg/day did not result in any adverse effects regardless of its origin. These
studies employed PS derived from fish, bovine cortex, or soy sources. The available scientific
evidence indicates that PS derived from fish lecithin is toxicologically equivalent to PS naturally
found in the diet or derived from bovine cortex or soy. Once inside the body, orally ingested PS
is hydrolyzed in the intestine prior to its absorption. The absorbed PS is transported and rapidly
converted into other endogenous constituents.
The acute oral LD 50 of PS in rats was reported as greater than 5 g/kg bw. In subchronic toxicity
studies in rats and dogs, NOAEL was determined to be approximately 1,000 mg/kg bw/day when
PS was administered for 6 months. In teratogenicity studies in rats and rabbits, PS did not affect
embryonic and fetal development. Multiple genotoxicity studies showed that PS did not reveal
any genotoxic or clastogenic activity.
Based on the above-described data and information, DHAPSTM, when used as a nutrient, is
expected to be safe.

VII. SAFETY ASSESSMENT
Numerous human and animal studies have reported benefits of DHAPSTM with no major adverse
effects. ECA uses a HACCP-controlled manufacturing process and rigorously tests its final
production batches to verify adherence to quality control specifications. There is broad-based
and widely disseminated knowledge concerning the chemistry of PS. This GRAS determination
is based on the data and information generally available and consented opinion about the safety
of PS from a marine source. The literature indicates that DHAPSTM offers consumers benefits
without adverse effects.
The following safety evaluation fully considers the composition, intake, nutritional,
microbiological, and toxicological properties of DHAPSTM, as well as appropriate corroborative
data.
1. ECA’s DHAPSTM is manufactured under current Good Manufacturing Practices
(cGMP) using common food industry materials and processes. Analytical data
from multiple lots indicate that DHAPSTM complies reliably with the established
food-grade product specifications and meets all applicable purity standards.
2. PS is an endogenous substance found in the human body. The bioavailability of
the ingested PS is limited due to extensive hydrolysis in the intestine prior to
absorption, and the absorbed PS is transported and rapidly converted into other
endogenous constituents.
3. Historical consumption of PS supports the safety of PS. PS is found in common
foods such as meat, fish, legumes, etc. PS has been marketed as a dietary
supplement for the past two decades without any adverse effects (except
gastrointestinal side effects such as nausea and indigestion). A typical
recommended dose of PS as a dietary supplement is 100 mg three times a day
(300 mg/day).
4. The 90th percentile EDI under the intended use is estimated to be 98.7 mg
PS/person (2.51 mg/kg bw/day) for all-users. The 90th percentile intake of PS is
approximately 3-fold lower than the safe levels (300 mg/day) determined on the
basis of available safety studies. The EDI estimates are based on the assumption
that DHAPSTM will replace currently marketed PS derived from various sources.
Thus, cumulative exposures are not expected.
5. A variety of animal toxicity studies and in vitro mutagenicity/genotoxicity studies
corroborate the human clinical safety data. In subchronic toxicity studies in rats
and dogs, NOAEL was determined to be close to 1,000 mg/kg bw/day when PS
was administered for 6 months.
6. In 40 human clinical studies, safety of PS has been confirmed at daily doses of up
to 300 mg for up to 6 months. The safety of PS derived from various sources has
24

DHAPS™

been proven in human clinical studies including susceptible groups (elderly and
children) and healthy individuals.
7. In the previous six GRAS notices (GRN 186, 197, 223, 279, 311, and 545) to the
FDA, the safety of PS derived from fish, soy, and sunflower sources has been
established in toxicological studies in animals and mutagenicity studies, and is
further supported by clinical studies in humans. In particular, the FDA had no
question on the safety of PS derived from fish lecithin (GRN 279 and 311).
8. Additional studies published subsequent to the FDA GRAS notices continue to
support the safety of PS as a food ingredient.
9. The FDA has agreed to exercise enforcement discretion with a Qualified Health
Claim Petition on PS. The petitioner in this submission demonstrated that PS is
safe at levels up to 500 mg/day.
10. The compositional data and product properties are consistent with carefully
controlled cGMP production and purification. ECA’s DHAPSTM preparation
contains no impurities or contaminants of concern.
11. Several reviews by experts in the field also have documented the safety of PS.
Based on the above-described data and information, we conclude that DHAPSTM, when used as a
nutrient, is reasonably expected to be safe.

VIII. CONCLUSION OF THE EXPERT PANEL:
GENERALLY RECOGNIZED AS SAFE (GRAS) DETERMINATION FOR THE
ADDITION OF PHOSPHATIDYLSERINE FROM MARINE SOURCE (DHAPSTM) TO
FOODS
Prepared for ECA Healthcare Inc.
We, the undersigned expert panel members, have critically evaluated the materials summarized
as follows. We conclude that phosphatidylserine (PS) derived from fish lecithin is safe and
Generally Recognized As Safe (GRAS) for its intended use in foods. The U.S. Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) has either listed or affirmed PS as GRAS according to the Title 21 Code
of Federal Regulations (21 CFR 170.3(o)(20)). Intended use of PS described in this GRAS
determination has been adopted from the previous GRAS notifications for PS from various
sources including fish, soy, and sunflower which already have received FDA no question letters.
Our conclusion is based on published animal toxicology and human clinical studies of PS from
various sources including PS derived from fish. We recognize that animal toxicity studies and
human clinical studies of PS do not present risks associated with the intended use and use levels
of DHAPSTM. The exact chemical structures and compositions of PS have been established and
fall into the non-toxic classification. Considering that PS derived from fish is of biological origin,
that it exists naturally in many foods, and that it does not represent a known health hazard,
DHAPSTM is considered as a GRAS substance.
It is also our opinion that other qualified and competent scientists reviewing the same publicly
available toxicological and safety information would reach the same conclusion. Therefore, we
have concluded that DHAPSTM , when used as described in this dossier, is GRAS based on
scientific procedures.
