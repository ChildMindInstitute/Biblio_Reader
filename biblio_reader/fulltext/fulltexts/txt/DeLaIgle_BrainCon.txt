1. Introduction
With the introduction of electroencephalography (EEG) in 1930, researchers began to
explore spontaneous activity in the brain by recording the individual, independently of any
task. Subsequently, evoked potential studies, where electrical potentials were recorded at the
onset of a stimulus, marked a milestone in brain research. Utilizing such methods coupled
with experimental psychology, researchers were able to explore task-related brain activity.
These early methods paved the way for new approaches to exploring brain function.
With the advent of blood oxygen-level dependent contrast (BOLD) measurements using
MRI, the first fMRI study was published in 1992 by Kwong and colleagues [1]. Within two
decades, fMRI has been an indispensable tool in the investigation of cognitive function of
brain. Currently fMRI studies comprise 43% of all fMRI publications [2]. At the time, it was
believed that when a stimulation paradigm is used to explore brain function (task-based
fMRI), only a small percentage of the energy utilized by the brain is actually measured.
The brain represents 2% of our entire body mass. Despite this, studies have shown that the
human brain is responsible for approximately 20% of the energy we consume. Additionally,
when one performs a specific cognitive task that involves attention or reflection, the brain
only uses 5% of its total metabolic expenditure [3, 4]. Yet, how does the brain expend the
majority of its energy?
In 1995, Biswal and colleagues observed that regions that are co-activated during a task are
correlated in their activity in the absence of a task [5]. This observation led to the conclusion
that intrinsic activity in the brain is a major source of energy expenditure. Up to that point of
time, spontaneous low frequency BOLD fluctuations were discarded as noise in task based
fMRI studies. These signals were considered to be crucial to understanding the intrinsic
activity of the brain.

Resting state fMRI relies on the assumption that spontaneous low frequency BOLD
fluctuations are a measure of intrinsic activity in the brain. Furthermore, the robustness of
functional connectivity analysis as a tool that reflects fundamental aspects of brain
organization through various cognitive states is another assumption that underlies this
methodology. Early methods of clinical observation and measurement were essential to the
development of the neurosciences. With the emergence of these techniques in the 19th
century, their application to the investigation of certain diseases and syndromes led the
conclusion that certain areas of the brain are correlated with specific higher executive
function, such as language and memory [6].
However, it is currently understood that higher cognitive functions are not localized to
specific areas of the brain, nor are they organized in a topographic fashion. Higher mental
processes are based on the cohesive and dynamic interplay of a complex set of functional
systems and cortical networks. To explore these dynamic and cohesive networks, the utility
of fMRI in linking a specific task with a specific pattern of brain activation (a set of coactivated areas) is indispensable. For example, studies that sought to demarcate cortical
regions of face recognition and mathematical computation demonstrated that such higher
mental functions require the integration of distributed cortical regions. Thus, cognitive
activities of higher mental order are not region specific, but are the result of the dynamic
interplay of a diffuse set of cortical areas and their underlying anatomical connectivity.
Consolidating the knowledge gleaned from various studies that focus on patterns of neural
Activation is a serious challenge that the neuro-scientific community faces today. Studies of
neurological and neuropsychiatric diseases [7] have substantiated that dysfunction in the
brain is not due to a focal lesion or the alteration of a single brain area, but due to the failure
of more widespread and diffuse systems. Schizophrenia and autism, for example, are
currently regarded as complex disorders of connectivity between components of large-scale
brain networks. The human brain is composed of approximately one billion neurons that
establish a complex underlying network of structurally and functionally interconnected
regions. Complex cognitive processes are possible as a result of the transmission of
information between different functional areas of the brain [8]. By exploring the
neuroanatomy of the brain and the underlying connectivity of different functional areas, we
can afford new insights on the organization of the human brain.

2. Brain connectivity: Basic concepts
To better understand the concept of functional connectivity, it is necessary to differentiate
between functional connectivity and structural connectivity. We define the two concepts in
the sections below.

2.1. Structural connectivity
Structural connectivity is defined as the set of physical connections between neural units.
Physically, anatomical connections are relatively stable over short time scales (seconds or
minutes), however, on larger time scales (days) they are subject to significant morphological

Brain Connections – Resting State fMRI Functional Connectivity 53

changes due to neuroplasticity. Nonetheless, the acquisition of these 'static' images of the
microstructure underlying the brain has wide implications on neuroscientific and clinical
questions. Currently, structural connectivity is investigated via methods that span axonal
tracing, histology and MRI. Technical progress in high-resolution MR has paved the road for
the examination the human cortex in vivo at resolutions of up to 300 microns. These scales
are approaching the resolutions obtained by histological analysis, which allow for the
verification of information obtained with cytoarchitectural maps for better division of the
images obtained by MR. [9]
Early work by Hahn [10] focusing on the effects of molecular diffusion on the magnetic
resonance signal marked a landmark in nuclear magnetic resonance research. Within a
decade, pulsed magnetic field gradients for the measurement of molecular diffusion were
introduced by Stejskal and Tanner [11]. Later, Le Bihan was able to incorporate diffusion
sensitizing magnetic field gradients into MRI [12]. This led to a novel method that had wide
applications in the analysis of the microstructure of the brain (Diffusion MRI). Diffusion
MRI is based on the simple idea of tracking the random walk of water molecules in the
anisotropic and confined space of axonal fibers. In 1994, Basser proposed a simple method
to quantify the Brownian motion of water molecules using tensor models (Diffusion Tensor
Imaging) [13]. While others models of quantifying diffusion were proposed, Basser`s single
tensor model is the most popular. Further research on the application of the tensor model
led to the introduction of tractography techniques (DTT, Diffusion Tensor Tractography). By
tracking the path of the principal eigenvector in a single voxel, researchers were now able to
reconstruct various white matter tracts noninvasively. However, the Diffusion Tensor
models introduced had a limited number of degrees of freedom and assumed that the
probability density function was Gaussian. As a result, single tensor diffusion imaging is
intrinsically limited in the analysis of voxels with multiple fiber populations, which could be
crossing, fanning or kissing [14]. Although multi-tensor models (high angular resolution
diffusion) and Diffusion Spectrum Imaging methods were introduced to overcome these
limitations, assumptions persist in these methods, making it difficult to explore
neuroanatomy to a high degree of accuracy.
To investigate the accuracy of these methods, several groups have attempted to compare
noninvasive fiber tracking with gold standard methods [15,16]. Lawes performed a direct
comparison between atlas based reconstruction methods and postmortem classical
dissection methods [17]. Tracts reconstructed using the Diffusion Tensor model are accurate
to some degree, as they have been applied to the clinical setting.
Nonetheless, although it may provide important information about the structural
connectivity between different brain areas, diffusion MRI does not provide a direct measure
of functional connectivity in the brain. While diffusion imaging can provide information
about the spatial relationship between two areas, it does not provide any information about
their temporal correlation. Such information has vast implications for cognitive
neuroscience research.

2.2. Functional connectivity
Functional connectivity (FC) can be investigated through various analytic methods that
include electroencephalogram (EEG), infrared light spectroscopy, task-based and resting
state fMRI.
By extracting correlation measurements from time series, functional
connectivity information can be acquired. Functional connectivity is essentially a statistical
concept [18]. Unlike anatomical connectivity, which describes physical pathways of
information exchange, functional connectivity describes the correlation of spatially remote
areas in the temporal domain. Dependence is calculated between all elements of a system,
whether these elements are connected by direct or indirect structural links. Functional
connectivity relies primarily on traditional fMRI techniques, but takes advantage of low
BOLD frequency fluctuations to examine intrinsic activity in the brain. Functional networks
generated using this method have been termed 'resting-state networks’. Approximately 6080% of brain metabolic consumption is due to the intrinsic activity of these networks.

2.3. Linking structure and function
In order to link structure to functions, one must consider the mechanism by which two
spatially remote areas are coactivated at any given time. It is currently unclear how many of
the networks detected at rest consist of direct anatomical links between cortical regions. Can
areas that do not have direct anatomical links exhibit functional connectivity? White matter
tracts can be considered as information highways that allow the exchange of functional
information between spatially remote regions. In this context, a high temporal correlation
between spatially remote areas must reflect a path of communication. Temporal correlation
between two regions implies that there are underlying anatomical links that facilitate
information transfer. Recently, studies that utilized both diffusion weighted MRI and resting

Brain Connections – Resting State fMRI Functional Connectivity 55

state fMRI, have suggested that there is a direct association between functional connectivity
and structural connectivity in the human brain [15, 19]. Having a clearer picture of
anatomical structure is critical for the analysis of functional dynamics. However, structural
connectivity does not provide any information about the temporal organization of
information exchange between regions. Therefore, it is important to note that while
functional connectivity implies structural connectivity, it does not imply that two areas a
directly connected. For example, the primary visual cortex has been shown to have strong
functional connections between its left and the right cerebral hemispheres, although
underlying white matter links are lacking between those regions [20].
It is observed that the functional interactions and their expression in behavior of the whole
organism can profoundly influence the structural patterns through a variety of mechanisms
of plasticity so that shows how the structural and functional connectivity are reciprocally
linked.
Studies that utilized EEG methods to examine spontaneous neuronal activity have shown
similar patterns of correlations exhibited by resting state fMRI. The nature of spontaneous
neuronal dynamics is a potential indicator of the presence of a "critical state", similar to a
dynamic regime that is characterized by a diverse set of intrinsic neuronal states that
provide answers to extrinsic disturbances. These consistent patterns of activation and
deactivation of brain regions during the transition from the task and resting state, led to the
discovery of a default mode state called default mode network (DMN) that is consistent
across multiple studies of rs-fMRI and/or EEG [21-25].

3. Functional connectivity: Resting state fMRI methods
In the following sections, we review several commonly used techniques for investigating
functional connectivity using resting state fMRI data. While these methods range across
numerous mathematical fields, and are based in various different assumptions about how to
understand underlying brain organization, they can fundamentally be grouped into two
categories: model-based and model-free methods. In any case all methodologies can lead us
to define a brain network as we will see in the following sections.

3.1. Model-based functional connectivity methods
Seed-based analysis is a hypothesis-driven method that is based on a priori decision
regarding the region-of-interest (ROI). Functional connectivity is then calculated using the
signal from this ROI as the model in subsequent voxelwise analysis.
Another common method used to establish ROIs for seed-based functional connectivity
analysis is meta-analysis. This technique is used to summarize the results across several
neuroimaging studies in order to establish common regions of activation. Such results then
serve to establish a consensus on the location of functional regions and to develop
hypotheses for further investigation.

56 Novel Frontiers of Advanced Neuroimaging

The goal of this analysis is to locate regions consistently activated (if any) on a set of diverse
and independent studies, which are related to the same psychological state [26]. This
method works basically by counting the number of peaks of activation in the studies
presented, comparing the number of peaks observed with a distribution of null to set a
criterion of significance. The two most representative approaches to perform such an
analysis are kernel density analysis (KDA) and activation likelihood estimation (ALE) [27].

3.2. Model-free functional connectivity methods
By definition, hypothesis independent methods lack a priori assumptions. These methods
are especially useful in the analysis of spatially distributed functional connectivity networks,
as they are not reliant of localized assumptions [15, 28-36].
The first analysis to study the functional integration used Principal Component Analysis
(PCA) [15, 37] to decompose fMRI data into a set of mutually uncorrelated components in
either space or time. More recently, Independent Component Analysis (ICA) has been used
to identify components that describe the activity in a widely dispersed network [28-35]. ICA
is an extension of the classical methods of Blind Source Separation (BSS). This technique
decomposes the time series in order to identify statistically independent components that
define functional networks. This technique has the advantage of extracting independent
components that may consist of noise signal, such as physiological or movement-related
noise. Although this analysis has many advantages and its applicability has opened doors to
new possibilities in the study design, the maps generated with this method are usually more
difficult to explain in comparison with those generated with the seed voxel analysis,
therefore, its applicability has some restrictions and limitations. Different authors have
analyzed the methodology of this technique and there are different variations of the method
[38, 39]. ICA has been used to explain a better way the large-scale structures that have been
detected in several independent studies [15, 36].
Clustering techniques aim to subdivide the data by means of a mathematical algorithm, so
that the observations assigned to the same group are more similar to each other than the
observations assigned to other groups. In the context of the study of functional connectivity
analysis in rs-fMRI, clustering algorithms have been used to perform brain parcellation in
groups of voxels or regions that are functionally connected to other regions. It should be
noted that clustering techniques applied to fMRI data are having a good acceptance both in
the detection of functional connectivity networks and in the architectural (anatomical)
subdivision of the brain [36].
The first application of clustering techniques to resting state functional data was performed
by Cordes et al [40]. Firsts attempts to employ this technique were limited due to the
computational complexity [41, 42]. Recently, more sophisticated studies have been
performed [43, 44] that have enabled identification of large-scale networks that agree with
those found in other studies [44].

Brain Connections – Resting State fMRI Functional Connectivity 57

Still, we should take into account some limitations to the technique. The most important is
that most clustering techniques require a priori selection of the number of clusters (K),
which will partition the data [36]. Since this value clustering (K) is unknown, multiple
solutions are usually calculated using a metric that predicts the "goodness" to determine the
optimal number of groups for that data set.
There is no single measure or an optimized solution, so different methods are used.
Ultimately, it is unlikely that the clustering is entirely independent of the initial partition
decision (K) determined by the subjectivity of the user, since it must evaluate the
appropriateness of pooling the results compared with networks of functional connectivity
well known. It can be concluded, therefore, that this technique also depends on the
subjectivity of the observer when describing the goodness of a grouping, as well as ICA.

3.3. Brain networks and graph theory
In 1998 Watts and Strogatz introduced the concept of small-world network [45]. There are
certain reasons, both empirical and theoretical, to understand the brain as a small-world
network [46] because the brain supports both distributed and modular processing (linked to
the concepts of functional segregation and functional integration). Considering the cognitive
processes under the network architecture, it is more efficient when exchanging information
at various scales: a high clustering allows a modular processing, while further distances
allow for distributed processing. Thus, small-world networks maximize the efficiency of
parallel processing and minimize the cost of communication between modules of nodes, as
well as being tolerant to failures.
Graph theory is the field of mathematics that is used to characterize various aspects of
network structure. In functional connectivity analysis, the application of graph theory aims
to ascribe nodes to various regions of interest, and generates links or arcs between them.
This approach makes it possible to explore functional connectivity networks using tools that
characterize typical properties of networks, for example the study of efficiency and
modularity.
Applying graph theory to resting state fMRI data involves assigning nodes to various
regions of interest. A functional connectivity graph is generated once edges are assigned to
connect nodes that have correlation values above a certain threshold. An important feature is
to study "the path", which is defined as a sequence of connected nodes. Path length between
two nodes is defined as the number of edges passing through node i to a node j. The distance
between two nodes of a graph is the minimum length among all possible paths connecting
these nodes. Degree of a node is defined as the number edges that are connected to it.
Two types of metrics are used to characterize graphs: local and global metrics. In local
metrics, values are assigned to each node individually, while in global metrics, values
characterize the graph as a whole.
A very important metric is the degree of distribution of a graph P(k). This metric provides
information on the number of nodes that offer a high degree of centrality. Various studies

58 Novel Frontiers of Advanced Neuroimaging

have shown that the scarcity of these nodes can be related to cognitive decline as observed
in Alzheimer's patients.
A complex network can be represented mathematically by edges and nodes [47].
Mathematically, nodes represent different parts of a system, and the relationship between two
nodes is represented by an edge. Applying these mathematical concepts to the brain, nodes
represent different areas of the brain, while edges represent anatomical, functional or effective
connectivity’s between these nodes. Utilizing such tools, we can construct (i) anatomically
based networks of white matter tracts; (ii) functional connectivity maps representing patterns
of correlation between BOLD signals; and (iii) effective networks representing causal
interaction patterns between brain areas. All three methods of network depiction can be
represented by adjacency matrices. In these matrices, rows and columns represent nodes,
while each array element (i, j) represents the interaction between two nodes i, j.
Criteria for the selection of nodes and edges to represent cortical networks often combine
methods from anatomical parcellation schemes and connectivity measures. Nodes must
represent brain regions with consistent patterns of connectivity, since only similar patterns
of fragmentations can be compared. Weighting of edges is interpreted differently in
different connectivity models. In anatomical connectivity modelling, weighting is
interpreted as a measure of the density of the anatomical tracts. While in functional
connectivity models, weighting indicates the magnitude of a correlation between brain
areas. And in effective connectivity models, weights may indicate causal interactions. By
thresholding weights of connections, networks could be trimmed to establish the topology
of significant links. The possibility of directionality in the edges makes it possible to
represent anatomical and effective models, while functional models can be perfectly
modelled by non-directional arcs.
Functional segregation refers to the involvement of specialized regions or networks in
specific functions. Segregation measures are important as they seek to quantify clusters in
given network. A basic strategy is to divide a network into subgroups, minimizing the
number of edges within a group and maximizing the number of edges outside of a group.
Utilizing such means, we can divide a network to be able to analyse a networks modular
structure.
Certain areas of the brain that act as hubs are crucial to the functionality of given networks.
In order to quantify this importance there are measures of centrality for the network. The
degree of a node can be used as a simple measure of the centrality of a node. Other more
sophisticated measures can also be used to quantify centrality. Many centrality measures are
based on important hubs that play a role in various networks. Measures of centrality have
different interpretations depending on type of network under study. A central node in an
anatomical network allows the assignment of structure to function between distant regions.
Such central anatomic nodes decrease values of centrality in functional networks.
Here we conclude that the analysis of complex networks has equipped use with necessary
tools to examine anatomical and functional networks of the brain, paving the way for the
possibility of quantifying many of their parameters.

4. RS-fMRI in cognitive neuroscience
It was in 1995 when Biswal and colleagues observed that a significant fraction of supposed
noise showed organized patterns consistent with known brain systems [5]. Biswal's work
aimed to examine patterns of neural activity of the motor system, and for that, experimental
subjects were asked for a standard task of finger opposition and then compared to a rs-fMRI
without asking them to do something. As Biswal initially demonstrated, the left and right
primary motor networks are correlated. This suggested that these areas are functionally
connected and that the process of information transfer between them is on-going [7, 39]. Later,
groups were able to replicate these results and further demonstrate correlations between
primary visual networks, auditory networks and higher order cognitive networks [3,7, 48-51].

4.1. Adquisition
Advantages of employing resting state functional connectivity analysis in cognitive
neuroscience studies include:

A brief period of time of acquisition (minutes) provides an expanded application to
the clinical setting. One of the most frequently cited motivations for using resting state
functional connectivity in clinical studies, is that it allows for increased sampling of
patient populations, since (i) it requires a brief acquisition period and (ii) has no specific
stimulation paradigm. This allows the patient to remain rest, or asleep or under the
influence of anesthesia. The absence of a stimulation paradigm in this case, is especially
important to the sampling of patient populations with neuropsychiatric disorders.
Computation: Several resting state functional connectivity methods are available for
analysis of neural circuitry in vivo. In contrast, using task-based fMRI, we are only
afforded connectivity information about the activated regions only.
Simple design: (baseline acquisition). Resting state studies may offer a better signal to
noise ratio than conventional task-based approaches.

4.2. Networks identified using resting state functional connectivity
A resting state network of particular interest is the default mode network (DMN). This
group of brain regions is active during rest and deactivates during most externally oriented
tasks [7, 52]. This component has been studied in different ways, the main interest of past
studies that implemented model-dependent method (seed voxel techniques) [5, 52] as well
as independent component analysis (ICA) [29].
Compared with other networks, the DMN is unique in the direction of its response to task
performance, which probably relates to its baseline level of neuronal and metabolic activity
and its role in brain function. The DMN is not unique, however, in demonstrating correlated
intrinsic activity; multiple networks exhibit coherent resting state activity that persists across
different states. The default mode network is one of the most robustly identified and
extensively investigated resting state networks that involves a set of regions that routinely
decrease their activity with tasks that demand attention [3, 7, 52]. Interestingly, this network

60 Novel Frontiers of Advanced Neuroimaging

has also been found to be negatively correlated with regions that tend to increase their activity
during attention demanding tasks. Other identified networks include a self-referential system
engaging the medial prefrontal regions; a posterior network involved in visual processing; an
attention network engaging superior frontal and parietal cortex; a superior temporal system;
and a network-engaging precentral and postcentral cortex [3, 7]. The most consistently
reported resting state networks include the primary sensorimotor network; the primary visual
and extra-striate visual network consisting of bilateral temporal/insular and anterior cingulate
cortex regions; left and right lateralized networks consisting of superior parietal and superior
frontal regions; and the default mode network consisting of precuneus, medial frontal, inferior
parietal cortical regions and medial temporal lobe [53].
Given the success of resting state functional connectivity for probing the brain’s functional
architecture in normal subjects, it is a great benefit to employ this technique towards the
investigation of dysfunction in the brain. A review by Fox and Greicius [8] highlights
advantages of examining the resting state signal for clinical applications and discusses
methodological issues that need to be resolved to facilitate translational applications of rsfMRI. A number of clinical applications are already emerging as emphasized by the studies
of functional connectivity in premature children [54], adolescents with schizotypal traits
[55], major depression, and aging [56]. Two recent reviews detail the large number of
studies that have utilized resting state fcMRI to study various neurological and psychiatric
conditions [4, 57].

4.3. Networks involved in neurological and psychiatric diseases
The functional connectivity of the DMN has been linked to core process of human cognition
such as the integration of cognitive and emotional processing [7], monitoring [58] and mindwandering. As a result, analysis of the connectivity patterns of the DMN is especially
important in examining cognitive dysfunction in neurological and neuropsychiatric brain
disorders [57, 59]. DMN alterations have been reported in a number of neuropsychiatric
diseases.
It has been shown that the DMN exhibits decreased connectivity patters in patients with
Alzheimer disease [60], decreased correlations within the DMN including hippocampi,
decreased anticorrelations with the DMN, and reduced local connectivity as reflected in
clustering coefficients, in which parts of this network have been clearly implicated.
Schizophrenia has been marked as a potential disconnection disease [61]. Widespread
functional disconnectivity between brain regions has been suggested to underlie these
symptoms [62, 63]. Schizophrenia is known to have aberrant effects on frontal and parietal
regions involved with the DMN. Resting state fMRI studies have reported a decrease in the
functional connectivity between medial frontal cortex and precuneus in schizophrenic
patients [64]. Additionally, diffusion tensor imaging studies have reported diminished
white matter integrity in patients with schizophrenia [65]. Specifically, a decrease in white
matter integrity was observed in the cingulum tract, which is known to be interconnected
with DMN regions MFC and PCC [50, 57]. Therefore, symptoms of patients with

Brain Connections – Resting State fMRI Functional Connectivity 61

schizophrenia can be attributed to alterations of the functional connectivity of the DMN.
Moreover, studies have also marked spatial differences in the default mode network in
schizophrenia patients together with significant higher frequency fluctuations in default
mode regions, as well as hyperactivity and hyperconnectivity of the default mode network
in patients in the early phase of schizophrenia [64]. These studies suggest an important role
for the default mode network in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia.
Altered functional connectivity patterns have been reported in other neurological disorders.
For example, in multiple sclerosis (MS) a decreased functional connectivity in the primary
motor has been established. This has substantiated studies that showed decreased
microstructural integrity of the callosal white matter tracts [66]. Additionally, in patients
with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), ICA analysis has suggested a decrease in
functional connectivity [67].

5. Global initiatives and the Human Connectome Project
There has been a long standing interest in the unrestricted sharing and access of functional
neuroimaging data within the neuroimaging community. Inherent within the methodology
of task based fMRI, the complexity of conforming task paradigms across different
acquisition sites limited the potential of having such an open access platform. However,
with the introduction of the unique methodological approach of resting state fMRI, a new
era in open access data sharing was ushered. Most notably, a data sharing consortium - the
1000 Functional Connectomes project (fcon_1000.projects.nitrc.org) - composed of various
groups from all around began this initiative in 2009. The fcon1000 project aggregated and
publicly released over 1200 resting state and anatomical MRI datasets acquired at 33 sites
around the world. Within the first six months, the release generated over 9000 download
from 78 countries. The benefit of unrestricted data sharing on the advancement of
neuroimaging is self-evident. Researchers with the resources to acquire data can ensure that
their resources are most widely used, while those researchers who prefer to focus on data
analysis can do so. Such initiatives had wide implications on the neuroimaging community.
Since large sets of data are now freely accessible, the valued commodity of the imaging
community is no longer the data itself, but the analytic tools and approaches of
interpretation and analysis. This new paradigm of unrestricted data access will be an
integral part of the future of brain research. The human brain is usually divided into several
hundred areas that exhibit highly specialized function. Cortical and subcortical regions of
divergent function exhibit distinct cytoarchitecture when viewed under a microscope. As
the human brain develops, mechanisms of axonal guidance allow the projection of millions
of axonal fibbers to target destinations. In the process, a complex network of information
processing pathways is formed.
The Human Connectome Project (HCP) [68] is an ambitious five year initiative that was
launched in 2010. Its main objective is to build a network map of the human brain to shed
light on its structural and functional connectivity. HCP leans on the general facet that the
function of a system is determined by its structure. By elucidating the complete underlying

62 Novel Frontiers of Advanced Neuroimaging

structure of white matter pathways, we will be able to glean significant information about
the function of this composite organ.
The term Connectome was introduced by Olaf Sporns in analogy to the human genome. An
approach that is more elaborate than mapping Connectomes, is mapping Synaptomes of the
brain. Such an effort would require imaging synaptic clefts at ultra-structural levels of
resolution. This endeavour is currently out of reach of the methods we possess today, as it
necessitates acquiring images of proteins and neurochemicals that govern the various
biochemical pathways of all synapses. Nonetheless, by relying on simple models systems
such as Caenorhabditis elegans – which has a total number of 302 neurons – we can examine
the feasibility of such a project.
Such mapping undertakings would provide considerable information to solve mysteries of
brain function. Connectivity in the brain can be studies at three levels of analysis.
Combining information from macroscopic, microscopic and nanoscopic levels of analysis,
would have wide implications on appreciating the full structural map of the brain.
