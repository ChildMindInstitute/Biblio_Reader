Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI) studies reveal a complex pattern of hyper- and
hypo-connectivity in children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Whereas rsfMRI ﬁndings tend to implicate
the default mode network and subcortical areas in ASD, task fMRI and behavioral experiments point to social dysfunction as a unifying impairment of the disorder. Here, we leverage a novel Bayesian framework for whole-brain
functional connectomics that aggregates population differences in connectivity to localize a subset of foci that are
most affected by ASD. Our approach is entirely data-driven and does not impose spatial constraints on the region
foci or dictate the trajectory of altered functional pathways. We apply our method to data from the openly shared
Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE) and pinpoint two intrinsic functional networks that distinguish
ASD patients from typically developing controls. One network involves foci in the right temporal pole, left
posterior cingulate cortex, left supramarginal gyrus, and left middle temporal gyrus. Automated decoding of
this network by the Neurosynth meta-analytic database suggests high-level concepts of “language” and “comprehension” as the likely functional correlates. The second network consists of the left banks of the superior temporal
sulcus, right posterior superior temporal sulcus extending into temporo-parietal junction, and right middle
temporal gyrus. Associated functionality of these regions includes “social” and “person”. The abnormal pathways
emanating from the above foci indicate that ASD patients simultaneously exhibit reduced long-range or interhemispheric connectivity and increased short-range or intra-hemispheric connectivity. Our ﬁndings reveal
new insights into ASD and highlight possible neural mechanisms of the disorder.

1. Introduction
Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is characterized by impaired social–emotional reciprocity, communication deﬁcits, and stereotyped
patterns of behavior (Americal Psychiatric Association, 2013). Thus far,
the etiological complexity and phenotypic heterogeneity of ASD has
greatly limited our understanding of its pathogenesis. Neurologically,
ASD cannot be attributed to a single uniﬁed brain dysfunction
(Waterhouse and Gilberg, 2014; Aoki et al., 2013); rather, it emerges
from complex interactions across the brain (Just et al., 2004;
Geschwind and Levitt, 2007; Sullivan et al., 2014). Behaviorally, the
manifestation and severity of symptoms vary considerably across individuals and over the lifespan of each patient. These challenges have impeded the discovery of robust neuroimaging biomarkers for the
disorder (Sullivan et al., 2014; Hernandez et al., 2014). Despite immense

clinical diversity, social dysfunction is considered a hallmark and unifying feature of ASD (Pelphrey et al., 2014). Social abnormalities are apparent in both verbal and nonverbal domains and manifest across
simple (e.g., shared gaze) and complex (e.g., back-and-forth conversation) behaviors. Since these deﬁcits emerge within the ﬁrst years of
life, the prevailing theory posits that ASD alters the developmental trajectory of inter-regional connections (Just et al., 2004; Geschwind and
Levitt 2007; Just et al., 2012; Melillo and Leisman, 2011; Courchesne
and Pierce, 2005) via experience-dependent processes. Speciﬁcally, individuals with ASD exhibit reduced long-range connectivity (Wolff et
al., 2012). These global patterns likely correspond to integration processes (Wolff et al., 2012; Oberman and Ramachandran, 2008) essential
for higher-order social, emotional and communication functions
(Rippon et al., 2007). At the same time, ASD patients show normal or increased connectivity within local networks, which may contribute to
enhanced sensory-motor processing in clinical sub-populations
(Johnson et al., 2002).
Task-based fMRI studies reveal an inconsistent pattern of hyper- and
hypo-connectivity between the cortex and limbic structures (Just et al.,
2012; Koshino et al., 2005). Such analyses have often been limited to

pre-deﬁned neural networks and do not reﬂect whole-brain patterns.
Similarly, temporal correlations within resting-state fMRI (rsfMRI) are
believed to reﬂect the intrinsic functional connectivity of the brain
(Biswal et al., 1995; Fox and Raichle, 2007; Buckner and Vincent,
2007). Robust rsfMRI ﬁndings have focused on the default mode
(Kennedy and Courchesne, 2008; Cherkassky et al., 2006) and salience
(von dem Hagen et al., 2013) networks, whereas global rsfMRI analyses
have identiﬁed distributed abnormalities across multiple neural processes (Supekar et al., 2013) and have yet to be reproduced. Recently,
there has been a push to model the brain as a system of interconnected
nodes. However, at present, the network analysis of ASD is limited to aggregate measures (e.g., centrality and degree distribution) (Paakki et al.,
2010; Cherkassky et al., 2006; Noonan et al., 2009), which do not pinpoint a concrete etiological mechanism for the disorder.
In contrast to prior work, we propose to aggregate connectivity differences between ASD patients and Typically Developing Controls
(TDCs) in order to localize the central nodes of the altered functional
networks, i.e., the disease foci. Our novel approach (Venkataraman et
al., 2013; Venkataraman, 2012) effectively translates pairwise rsfMRI
correlations into estimates of the affected brain regions. Within a Bayesian framework, we deﬁne a latent graph that characterizes K independent networks of abnormal functional connectivity, emanating from
the disease foci. These latent variables specify an underlying architecture that we cannot directly access, but which generates populationlevel differences in the observed rsfMRI data. Our solution algorithm
jointly infers the regions affected by the disease and the induced network topology. Hence, our model provides new insights into the
disrupted neural pathways of ASD and promises to enhance our understanding of its clinical phenomenology.
We demonstrate our approach on data from the publicly available
and multi-site Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE)
(DiMartino et al., 2014). Previous work on ABIDE has revealed
widespread hypo-connectivity across nearly every functional system,
coupled with hyper-connectivity between sub-cortical areas
(DiMartino et al., 2014). Region abnormalities have been localized to
the thalamus, insula and occipital gyrus (DiMartino et al., 2014),
which are not traditionally associated with the social brain. In contrast,
our Bayesian model identiﬁes key areas in the default network and temporal lobe that are thought to be involved in processing social stimuli.
Moreover, the extracted networks tend to exhibit both reduced distal
connectivity and increased local connectivity. We selected four ABIDE
sites with well-matched populations of children and adolescents (see

Table 2). We used non-parametric permutation tests and a
bootstrapping setup to evaluate the reproducibility of our region foci
on random subsets of the data. Encouragingly, the identiﬁed regions
are mainly in the temporal and frontal lobes, and our results show remarkable similarities when inferring one (K = 1) and two (K = 2) abnormal networks. As such, our model can reliably integrate multiacquisition rsfMRI data to extract robust and clinically informative
biomarkers.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Connectivity dataset
ABIDE includes rsfMRI, anatomical and phenotypic data from 539
patients with ASD and 573 age-matched TDCs (DiMartino et al., 2014).
All images were obtained with informed consent, in accordance with
established human subject research procedures. Detailed information
on participant recruitment, assessment and quality control are found
at fcon_1000.projects.nitrc.org/indi/abide/. Given the considerable variation of MR acquisition protocols across sites, we opt to leverage rsfMRI
data of children and adolescents (7–19 years) from four participating
institutions rather than ﬁlter all subjects by age. These sites are the
Yale Child Study Center, the Kennedy Krieger Institute, the University
of California Los Angeles (Sample 1), and the University of Michigan
(Sample 1). Table 1 reports the functional scan parameters used at
each center.
Inclusion criteria for subjects within the chosen sites were wholebrain coverage of the MR acquisition, successful preprocessing with
manual inspection of the MPRAGE and BOLD images, and accurate
co-registration between the modalities. In addition, we exclude
subjects that exhibit signiﬁcant head motion (N 0.5 mm translation
or N0.5° rotation) in 25% or more time points of the BOLD series.
The maximum rotation between consecutive volumes was 0.8° on
average for TDCs and 1.0° for ASD patients, which was not signiﬁcant
(p N 0.17). The maximum translation was 0.6 mm on average for
TDCs and 0.8 mm for ASD patients. While marginally different
(p N 0.024), the overall displacement falls within an EPI voxel resolution and can be easily corrected by motion scrubbing. We also exclude individuals for which the distribution of region-wise rsfMRI
correlations was markedly different from all other subjects, as measured by the Hellinger distance. In total, 260 subjects (141 TDC, 119
ASD) were identiﬁed for subsequent analysis. Table 2 reports the

demographic information for these subjects and conﬁrms adequate
matching in age and clinical measures across sites. Despite the FIQ
differences at Yale and Kennedy Krieger, the population means in
the full dataset are 107.4 ± 11.9 for TDCs vs. 102.3 ± 16.0 for ASD
patients, and the box plots in Fig. 1 reveal considerable overlap in
the corresponding interquartile intervals.
2.2. Preprocessing
We used Freesurfer (Fischl et al., 2004) to process the MPRAGE anatomical images. Consistent region boundaries across subjects were derived from the built-in Desikan–Killiany atlas, which segments the
brain into 86 cortical and subcortical regions that roughly correspond
to Brodmann areas. The structural ROIs were then projected onto the
subject-native fMRI space for each individual.
The BOLD data was processed using FSL (Smith et al., 2004) and
MATLAB (MATLAB, 2013). We discarded the ﬁrst seven rsfMRI time
points, performed motion correction via rigid body alignment and
slice timing correction using trilinear/sinc interpolation. The data was
spatially smoothed using a Gaussian kernel with 5 mm FWHM and
bandpass ﬁltered with cutoffs 0.01 Hz and 0.1 Hz. Finally, we regressed
global contributions to the time courses from the white matter, ventricles and whole brain to diminish the inﬂuence of physiological noise.
We also performed data scrubbing to remove consecutive time points
with N0.5 mm translation or N0.5° rotation between them. We compute
rsfMRI connectivity as the Pearson correlation coefﬁcient between the
mean time courses within the two regions. These pairwise connectivity
values are then aggregated into a rsfMRI data matrix for each subject.

remain distinct, and conditions 3 and 4 impose an outward spreading
topology on the altered pathways. We use latent functional connectivity
variables Fij and F i j to model the neural synchrony between two regions
in the control and ASD populations, respectively. Ideally F i j ≠F i j for
abnormal connections and F i j ¼ F i j for healthy connections. However,
due to noise, we assume that the latent templates can deviate from
the above rules with probability . Finally, the subject rsfMRI observam
tions Blij and Bi j provide noisy information about the hidden structure.
Appendix A presents the four mathematical equations that deﬁne our
model.
We employ a variational Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm
(Jordan et al., 1999) to estimate both the latent posterior probability of
each region qi and the nonrandom model parameters from the observed
data. We evaluate the robustness of our approach via non-parametric
permutation tests and by ﬁtting the model to random subsets of the
data. To construct the null distribution of disease foci, we randomly permute the subject diagnoses (TDC vs. ASD) 1000 times and compute the
region posterior probabilities qi for each trial. The signiﬁcance of region i
is the proportion of permutations that yield a larger value of qi (for any
of the K networks) than is obtained under the true labeling. Notice that
this is a particularly stringent criterion for K N 2, since the above p-value
does not account for the dependencies between the networks. For the
bootstrapping experiment, we ﬁt the models using 50% of the data,
such that the ratio of TDC subjects to ASD patients remains constant.
We intentionally do not control for other demographic or clinical variables (site, age, IQ, ADOS/ADI scores) in order to test the limits of our
method on heterogeneous data. We resample the data 50 times and
consider the region posterior statistic qi, as averaged across runs.

2.3. Bayesian analysis

2.4. Meta-analytic decoding of network function

Our model assumes that the connectivity differences induced by
ASD can be explained by a set of K non-overlapping networks, as
outlined in Fig. 2. Here, K is a user-speciﬁed parameter that controls
the model complexity. Each network is characterized by impairments
in a small subset of brain regions, or foci. These impairments subsequently alter neural communication from the disease foci to the rest
of the brain. We use a probabilistic framework to represent the interaction between regions and to describe the effects of ASD. Here, latent variables specify a template organization of the brain, which we cannot
directly access. Instead, we observe noisy measurements of the hidden
structure via rsfMRI correlations.
The generative process begins by selecting the region foci Ri for each
of the K networks. Given these assignments, aberrant functional connectivity is deﬁned using a simple set of rules: (1) a connection between
two disease foci in the same network k is always abnormal, (2) a connection between two foci in different networks is never abnormal,
(3) a connection between two healthy regions is never abnormal, and
(4) a connection between a healthy and a diseased region is abnormal
with probability η. As seen, condition 2 ensures that the K networks

We rely on the Neurosynth database (www.neurosynth.org) to provide an unbiased and comprehensive evaluation of the functionality
supported by each intrinsic network. The meta-analytic framework leverages the power of large datasets to compute whole-brain posterior distributions P(Feature|Activation) for individual psychological features
(i.e., words or terms) (Yarkoni et al., 2011). In this way, we can perform
an unbiased reverse-inference to identify constructs that have been consistently associated with a particular activation coordinate across a wide
variety of fMRI studies. Thus, one effectively “decodes” mental states
from brain activity. Statistical inference is performed using a chi-square
test to generate p-value maps, which are FDR-corrected (q b 0.01) for
multiple comparisons (for details, see Yarkoni et al., 2011). At the time
of this writing, the database included fMRI results across 9721 studies,
with over 347,911 reported coordinates and 3099 feature terms (topics).
A complete listing of the individual studies, along with guidelines for the
user interface, can be found on the Neurosynth website.
For each set of network foci in Fig. 4, we computed the voxel-wise
Pearson correlation with the statistical maps obtained from each of
the 3099 Neurosynth features (Chang et al., 2013); terms with

correlation above the default threshold (r N 0.001) were retained. The
corresponding topics were automatically generated by the Neurosynth
inference engine via Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) (Blei et al.,
2003). Whole-brain reverse inference maps for each topic were computed in an identical manner to that described previously for featurebased analyses in Yarkoni et al. (2011, 2009). The resulting coefﬁcients
were then used to generate a ranking of the psychological topics most
speciﬁcally associated with each intrinsic functional network, where
the values indicated the degree to which engagement of the network
implied that a psychological state or process was likely to be present.

qi N 0.50) and corresponding pathways for K = 1 and K = 2 abnormal networks, respectively. We colored each region according to the uncorrected

high signiﬁcance. From these regions, we estimated the graph of abnormal functional pathways, as shown on the right (Xia et al., 2013). The

of abnormal functional connectivity. The yellow nodes correspond to disease foci. Blue lines indicate reduced functional connectivity in ASD, and magenta lines denote increased functional
connectivity in ASD. Network 1 is nearly identical to the single network obtained in Fig. 3. Network 2 extends the solution via the banks of the superior temporal sulcus (L.Bank), the inferior parietal cortex (R.InfP), and the middle temporal gyrus (R.MidT).

single network results in Fig. 3 identify four brain regions localized to the
left middle temporal gyrus (qi = 0.97, p b 0.001), the left posterior cingulate (qi = 1.00, p b 0.01), the left supramarginal gyrus (qi = 1.00, p b 0.01),
and the right temporal pole (qi = 1.00, p b 0.05). Estimation of abnormal
pathways indicates a general reduction in long-range connectivity (blue
lines) and an overall increase in short-range connectivity (magenta
lines) in ASD. This global pattern has been well established in the autism
literature (Wolff et al., 2012; Johnson et al., 2002). Remarkably, the ﬁrst
inferred network in Fig. 4 exhibits near identical posterior probabilities,
signiﬁcance values and abnormal connectivity to the results for K = 1. Additionally, we recovered a second network with lower overall signiﬁcance
that consists of the left banks of the middle superior temporal sulcus
(qi = 1.00, p b 0.04), the right posterior superior temporal sulcus extending into inferior parietal lobule (qi = 0.86, p b 0.08), and the right middle
temporal gyrus (qi = 0.98, p b 0.07). We accepted a lower signiﬁcance
threshold for this network due to our stringent criteria of computing
p-values for K N 1 (see Methods). The corresponding functional pathways demonstrate reduced inter-hemispheric connectivity but largely
increased intra-hemispheric connectivity. These ﬁndings suggest that
our framework captures different levels of effect by varying the model
complexity K. Finally, we observe consistence in parameter estimates
across random subject re-labelings in the permutation procedure (see
Figs. 5 and 6). Hence, the main inﬂuences of the experiment are reﬂected
in the region posterior assignments rather than in the data likelihood.
3.2. Model reproducibility
Figs. 7 and 8 report the average posterior probability of each region
across 50 random samplings of the data, for K = 1 and K = 2,

respectively. Each subset contained half of the subjects, such that the
ASD to TDC ratio is preserved. We have displayed only the regions for
which the average posterior assignment is greater than 0.15 — thereby
emphasizing only the most prominent patterns. The color bar indicates
the average posterior, such that yellow denotes the strongest foci and
red corresponds to the weakest inﬂuence. Many of the regions implicated by the single network model in Fig. 7 correspond to the lower significance cluster of the multi-class solution in Fig. 8. This underscores an
ongoing debate in the ﬁeld that statistical signiﬁcance, as measured by
p-value, is not always a good indicator of reproducibility. Favorably,
the two abnormal networks that we obtained from the entire dataset
support the consistent patterns in Figs. 5 and 6. This indicates that our
Bayesian model can pinpoint robust effects in whole-brain rsfMRI data.
3.3. Meta-analytic decoding
We used the Neurosynth database (www.neurosynth.org) to metaanalytically “decode” the psychological processes associated with each
intrinsic network. In particular, the decoder correlated the spatial map
of network foci with 3099 topic-based meta-analysis maps in the
Neurosynth database. We retained topics with positive correlations at
or above the default threshold r = 0.001. The upper panel of Fig. 9 illustrates the top 10 constructs implied by each set of foci, including words
that overlap between the two networks. We omitted topics that describe a methodological technique (e.g., default mode) or a neurological
disorder (e.g., autism, which was among the top 10 for both networks).
These mental states, obtained via reverse inference of brain activation,
revealed both overlap and clear functional distinctions between the
two intrinsic networks. Network 1 was associated with language-

related topics, including comprehension and semantic processing. Network 2 also loaded heavily on language constructs, but was uniquely associated with social-related topics, such as person and self-referential
processing. The bottom panels of Fig. 9 display the relative speciﬁcity
of each supra-threshold topic generated by the Neurosynth decoder;
the font size reﬂects the correlation magnitude.
4. Discussion
The localization of region hubs, which describe pathological brain
networks, provides key insights into the neural basis of ASD. Our
Bayesian model (Venkataraman et al., 2013; Venkataraman, 2012) facilitates a biological interpretation of the group differences, and the validation procedures conﬁrm the reliability of our ﬁndings. We emphasize
that the model is completely data driven, i.e., we do not guide or constrain the solution according to a priori theoretical speculations about
the networks that should be involved in the disorder. Moreover, the
analysis is performed on whole-brain rsfMRI data and treats all
regions/connections equally. Our approach marks a new direction of
study for ASD and has the potential to reveal unbiased and complex inﬂuences within the brain.
Figs. 3 and 4 depict the salient patterns, assuming that population
differences in rsfMRI correlations can be explained by one or two abnormal networks, respectively. The primary network consists of four ASDrelated foci: the right temporal pole, the left posterior cingulate cortex,
the left supramarginal gyrus, and the left middle temporal gyrus. Automated decoding of this network by the Neurosynth meta-analytic
framework implicates the concepts of “language” and “comprehension”
as likely the functional correlates. Our model also identiﬁes a secondary
network that consists of the left banks of the superior temporal sulcus,
the right poster STS, extending into the inferior parietal lobule, and

the right middle temporal gyrus. The primary associated functions
include “social” and “person”. We observe that several of the altered
connections in Fig. 4 (bottom) extend from the temporal lobe foci to
the prefrontal cortex. Accordingly, it has been suggested that genes
associated with ASD congregate in the deep layer projection neurons
of the prefrontal and primary motor cortex, and that they are
expressed during midfetal development (Tebbenkamp et al., 2014).
Hence, exploring the relationship between our abnormal brain networks and the underlying genetic inﬂuences of ASD is an important
direction for future work.
Our approach has revealed abnormal resting state functional connectivity in a network of brain regions known to engage in language processing (left middle temporal gyrus, the left posterior cingulate, the
left supramarginal gyrus, and the right temporal pole). Language and
communication difﬁculties are deﬁning features of ASD. Speciﬁcally, language plays a central role in enabling academic achievement, vocational
options, independent living, and mainstream integration for individuals
with ASD. Task-based fMRI has informed us about the system-level organization of language processing. For example, the upper bank of the
STS responds preferentially to the human voice, in comparison to
other, well-matched acoustic signals (Belin et al., 2000; Hickok, 2009).
Price's review (Price, 2009) on the anatomy of language in typical individuals suggests that phonemic perception is relatively localized to the
bilateral superior temporal gyri (STG). Similarly, perception of meaningful speech localizes to the middle and inferior temporal cortex, word retrieval to the left angular gyrus and pars orbitalis, and sentence
comprehension to the bilateral STS. Hickok (Hickok, 2009) has suggested that fronto-basal ganglia circuits and the anterior temporal
lobe/pole are also involved in sentence comprehension.
Task-based fMRI studies of language have also revealed lateralization differences in ASD. For example, an investigation of speech

more strongly to socially meaningful human actions than to non-goaldirected movements (Bahnemann et al., 2010). In the auditory domain,
the posterior STS responds to affective speech (Wildgruber et al., 2006).
Ethofer et al. (2006) discovered that the posterior STS is the input region
of the affective voice processing system, where such information is extracted and represented. In terms of somatosensory input, stroking
skin areas with C-tactile (CT) nerves with a soft brush, thereby mimicking the type of touch during a close social interaction, has been shown to
activate the posterior STS (Björnsdotterr et al., 2014; Gordon et al.,
2013). Finally, the posterior STS is functionally interconnected to all
key regions in the “social brain” (Yang et al., 2015).
There is strong evidence for atypical cortical and subcortical processing of visual, auditory, and somatosensory signals related to social perception in ASD. When young children with ASD were shown
point-light displays of coherent versus scrambled biological motion,
they exhibited reduced activity in the FFG, amygdala and posterior
STS compared to their unaffected siblings and typically developing
peers (Kaiser et al., 2010). In the auditory domain, individuals with
ASD showed a similar activation pattern to controls for non-vocal
sounds but failed to activate the voice-selective regions of the posterior STS in response to vocal sounds (Gervais et al., 2004). Finally,
with respect to somatosensory signals, individuals that reported
more autistic traits displayed reduced activity in the OFC and posterior STS in response to slow and gentile touch to the forearm (Voos
et al., 2013).
It is worth mentioning that our method does not identify certain regions that have been previously reported in the ASD literature.
Examples include the prefrontal cortex, as related to working memory
and executive function (Just et al., 2004; Courchesne and Pierce, 2005;
Baron-Cohen et al., 1999; Gilbert et al., 2008), and the visuomotor cortex
(Koshino et al., 2008; Allen and Courchesne, 2003; Muller et al., 2003;
Villalobos et al., 2005). The absence of these ﬁndings suggests weak evidence in the data for prefrontal and visual areas to act as foci. Contributing
factors include subtleties of the rsfMRI paradigm, high levels of noise due
inter-site variability, heterogeneity of ASD symptoms across subjects, unexplored genetic inﬂuences, or (most likely) a combination of the above.
A future reﬁnement to the Bayesian framework might include additional
random variables to account for external inﬂuences. However, such modiﬁcations are beyond the scope of this paper.

processing in sleeping 2–3 year olds found reduced activity in brain
regions associated with language comprehension, along with greater
activation in medial and frontal areas of the right hemisphere in ASD
(Redcay and Courchesne, 2008). This trend towards greater recruitment of right hemisphere regions increases with age into the preschool period (Eyler et al., 2012). Functional neuroimaging studies
in older speakers with ASD have also found evidence of hemispheric
abnormalities. Reduced activation in the left inferior frontal gyrus
(Just et al., 2004; Garey et al., 2007; Kana et al., 2006; Lai et al.,
2012a,b; Mülller et al., 1998, 1999a) and atypical activation in the
right frontal lobe (Mülller et al., 1999a,b) have been reported during
language paradigms. A meta-analysis by Phillips (Philip et al., 2012)
recently summarized these ﬁndings to suggest greater activation in
the right precentral gyrus in children with ASD, as well as reduced
activation in the bilateral STG, and generally decreased left lateralization of a variety of language functions (see (Boddaert et al., 2003;
Dawson et al., 1989; Kleinhans et al., 2008; Knaus et al., 2008) for
more details).
Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) has demonstrated reduced
anatomical connectivity for language processing (Just et al., 2004; Kana
et al., 2006), as well as white matter disruptions in language pathways
(Alexander et al., 2007; Barnea-Goraly et al., 2004; Keller et al., 2007;
Lee et al., 2007) in children with ASD. Minshew and Keller (Minshew
and Keller, 2010) suggest that speakers with ASD show greater than normal activation and connectivity in posterior areas and reduced connectivity to frontal systems typically involved in language processing. The
authors interpret these trends as a sign of over-reliance on visuospatial
abilities for verbal reasoning tasks.
Our Bayesian model also pinpoints dysfunction in a well known social perception network centered in the right posterior STS, extending
into the inferior parietal lobule and the right middle temporal gyrus
(Yang et al., 2015). This network receives and interprets direct input
from primary visual and auditory regions in human and nonhuman primates (Belin et al., 2000; Brothers, 1996; Hoffman and Haxby, 2000;
Jastorff et al., 2012; Kreifelts et al., 2009). The posterior STS is sensitive
to and selective for social stimuli that signal intent in humans (Jastorff
et al., 2012). It responds to static social (i.e., faces) vs. non-social stimuli
(i.e., objects) as well as complex dynamic social information (Gobbini
and Haxby, 2007; Watson et al., 2014). The posterior STS responds

again, the regions correspond to the supramarginal gyrus (L.SupM), the inferior parietal cortex (R.InfP), the middle temporal gyrus (R.MidT), and the posterior cingulate (L.PCC & R.PCC).

We include words that overlap between networks, resulting in 14 total features. Lower: Word clouds illustrate the rankings of psychological functions. Word size reﬂects rank-ordered
correlation coefﬁcients, which emphasizes terms that are most associated with each network (Poldrack et al., 2009).

A major limitation of prior connectivity analyses is the difﬁculty
interpreting the results post hoc. For example, univariate tests select
independent connections inﬂuenced by disorder. However, the bulk
of our knowledge about the brain is organized around regions
(e.g., functional localization, cortical thickness) and not the connections
between them. Moreover, it is nearly impossible to design noninvasive
experiments that probe an arbitrary connection in the brain. While region
statistics attempt to localize the impairments, they also average the
pairwise effects measured by rsfMRI. Hence, we can rarely tie statistical
differences in region statistics to an underlying etiological mechanism.
Our method overcomes these limitations by explicitly modeling the propagation of information in the brain from regions to connections. Given the
rsfMRI correlation matrices, we can easily infer both the disease foci and
the neural breakdown associated with ASD. These variables have a
straightforward biological meaning and can be used to design follow-up
studies for ASD.
We provide two forms of validation: statistical signiﬁcance, as quantiﬁed by non-parametric permutation tests, and test–retest reliability
on random subsets of the data. On average, we are able to ﬁnd the original disease foci in Figs. 7 and 8. However, these experiments highlight
an important point; namely, the most robust foci have among the lowest statistical signiﬁcance in Figs. 3 and 4. This ties into an ongoing debate about the utility and reliability of p-values (Goodman, 2008).
Furthermore, it is unclear whether to apply signiﬁcance and multiple
comparison correction to Bayesian models, since these formulations
are not designed for conventional hypothesis testing. Encouragingly,
both evaluation schemes produce similar results, which supports that
the region foci correspond to robust phenomena within the highly heterogeneous ABIDE data.
It is important to note that our results may be inﬂuenced by the selection of regions. Due to the copious inter-site and inter-subject variability of rsfMRI within ABIDE, if the regions are too small, then group
differences are likely driven by noise. In contrast, larger regions

potentially blur relevant functional distinctions. This work relies on
the Desikan–Killiany atlas in Freesurfer (Fischl et al., 2004), which provide anatomically meaningful correspondences across subjects that relate to functional divisions within the brain. We include the results for
K = 1, 2, and 3 using the Freesurfer Destrieux atlas in Supplementary
Results. As seen, there is a great deal of overlap between the two
parcellations, in terms of identifying social brain regions. However,
there are lso notable differences, which suggest that selecting the appropriate resolution for analysis is a nontrivial problem. We emphasize
that the Bayesian framework readily applies to any set of consistent
ROIs across subjects.
Finally, we address the model complexity parameter K, which speciﬁes the number of abnormal networks to explain the data. Our results
for K = 1 and 2 suggest an evolution of disease foci, such that additional
clusters explain progressively weaker phenomena. Intuitively, the reproducibility goes down with increasing K, as the model possesses
more degrees of freedom (see Fig. 7 vs. 8). This posits a tradeoff between
robustness and our ability to pinpoint smaller effects. Due to the
absence of ground truth connectivity information, we believe that
meta-analysis and clinical relevance are the best measures to evaluate
the impact of K. The present work uses a data-driven clustering scheme
to estimate multiple abnormal networks. Alternatively, we might use
clinical scores to tailor the networks to particular subtypes of the ASD
population. Therefore, our Bayesian model promises to be a powerful
analysis tool for future exploration.
5. Conclusion
We have demonstrated that a Bayesian analysis of whole-brain functional connectivity, as measured via resting-state fMRI, supports the
theory of impaired social cognition in ASD. Our model captures multivariate dependencies between pairwise connections to infer both the
region foci that are most affected by ASD and the corresponding

networks of functional abnormalities. We leverage the multi-site Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange and localize the regions implicated
by ASD to the temporal lobe and default mode network. Reliability of
these results is conﬁrmed by non-parametric permutation tests and
test–retest experiments. Our discoveries provide valuable insights into
the underlying neural mechanisms of ASD and bring us one step closer
to deciphering its complex pathogenesis.

such that 1 = η + (1 − η)(1 − ). The ﬁrst condition in Eq. (A.3) states
that if both regions are healthy (Ri = Rj = 0), then the edge 〈i, j〉 is
healthy. Consequently, the functional connectivity of the ASD population is equal to that of the control population with probability 1 − ,
and it differs with probability . This relationship also holds if the two regions are foci in different abnormal networks (second line of Eq. (A.3)).
The third term is similarly obtained by replacing  with 1 − . Finally,
the probability 1 in the fourth condition reﬂects the coupling between
η and  if one region is healthy and the other is diseased.
The rsfMRI correlation Blij between regions i and j in the lth TDC
subject is a noisy observation of the functional connectivity Fij:

This discrete representation of functional connectivity is a notable
departure from conventional analysis. Essentially, we assume that
rsfMRI correlations fall into one of three general categories and differences in bin assignment are the relevant markers of a disease. Our
choice of three states is motivated by the rsfMRI literature. For example,
most works specify a threshold to determine functionally connected
areas, which corresponds to Fij = 1 in our framework. Moreover, strong
negative correlations are often found in rsfMRI data. Since there is no
consensus about their origin and signiﬁcance (van Dijk et al., 2010),
we isolate negative connectivity (i.e., Fij = −1) as a separate category.
The latent functional connectivity F i j of the ASD population is also
tri-state and is based on Fij and the region indicator variables Ri:
