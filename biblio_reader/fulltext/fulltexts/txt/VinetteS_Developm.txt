The intraparietal sulcus (IPS), a region in the dorsal attention network (DAN), has been implicated in
multi-sensory attention and working memory. Working memory and attention develop across childhood; changes in functional connectivity within the DAN may relate to this maturation. Previous ﬁndings
regarding fronto-parietal intrinsic functional connectivity age-effects were mixed. Our study aimed to
circumvent limitations of previous work using a large cross-sectional sample, 183 typically developing participants 6.5–20 years, from the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange, and seed regions along
the anterior-to-posterior axis of the IPS. These seeds, IPS0-4, were entered into functional connectivity models. Group-level models investigated differential connectivity along the IPS and relationships
with age. Anterior IPS3/4 exhibited greater connectivity with sensorimotor/pre-motor regions. Posterior IPS0/1 demonstrated greater connectivity with dorsal and ventral visual regions. Positive age-effects
were found between IPS3-4 and visual regions. Negative age-effects were found between IPS and superior
parietal and medial orbitofrontal cortices. Follow-up region of interest analyses were used to estimate
age-effects for DAN and anticorrelated default mode network regions. Results suggest age-effects on IPS
functional connectivity are relatively modest, and may differ pre- and across-adolescence. Studying typical age-related connectivity variability within this network may help to understand neurodevelopmental
disorders marked by impaired attention.

1. Introduction
The intraparietal sulcus (IPS) is located along the dorsal visual
pathway and is a key node in the network underlying spatial attention (Astaﬁev et al., 2003; Corbetta et al., 2000; Goodale and Milner,
1992; Silver and Kastner, 2009). This functionally heterogeneous
brain region has also been implicated in multisensory attention
(Anderson et al., 2010), working memory (Champod and Petrides,
2007; Pessoa et al., 2002), and numerical cognition (Cantlon and Li,
2013; Dehaene et al., 2003; Pinel et al., 2001; Rosenberg-Lee et al.,
2011). The IPS is a core node of the dorsal attention (Power et al.,
2011) or task-positive network (Fox et al., 2005; Toro et al., 2008),
which includes putative human frontal eye ﬁelds (hFEF) and supplementary motor area (hSMA) as well as dorsolateral prefrontal
cortex (DLPFC) and occipito-temporal regions (near human middle
temporal (MT)+).
The IPS can be divided into a set of regions spanning the anteriorto-posterior axis, on the basis of phase reversals in topographic
organization, similar to retinotopic visual cortex (Sereno et al.,
2001). These regions show differences in functional responses
across tasks (Bray et al., 2013a; Sheremata et al., 2010; Silver and
Kastner, 2009; Swisher et al., 2007; Szczepanski et al., 2013), and
differential white matter structural connectivity to visual regions
and parts of the dorsal attention network (Bray et al., 2013b;
Greenberg et al., 2012; Szczepanski et al., 2013). In these studies,
structural connectivity is deﬁned using probabilistic tractography to determine the likelihood that two regions are joined by
a direct white matter pathway. With regards to the IPS, posterior regions show preferential connectivity with dorsal and ventral
visual regions (Bray et al., 2013b; Greenberg et al., 2012), while
anterior regions show more probable connections to prefrontal and
pre-motor regions (Bray et al., 2013b; Mars et al., 2011; Szczepanski
et al., 2013). Lesion studies (Vandenberghe et al., 2012) and task
activation and connectivity studies (Hutchinson et al., 2015) further
support functional sub-divisions along the IPS.
Visual-spatial attention and working memory mature across
late childhood and adolescence (Westerberg et al., 2004; Zhan et al.,
2011). Functional connectivity is a measure believed to reﬂect the
synchrony between brain regions (Friston, 1994), and is often calculated as the temporal correlation between pairs of time-series.
Changes in functional and structural/white matter connectivity
with age are hypothesized to be a key driver of cognitive maturation (Blakemore, 2012; Fair et al., 2007; Rubia, 2013; Supekar
et al., 2009; Uddin et al., 2011). In support of this view, protracted
development of white matter structure has been observed through
early adulthood (Lebel et al., 2008). Age-related variation in frontoparietal white matter properties across childhood has been linked
to increased working memory capacity (Nagy et al., 2004; Østby
et al., 2011), and visual-spatial attention (Klarborg et al., 2013).
Findings regarding age-effects on fronto-parietal functional
connectivity have been mixed. Several developmental neuroimaging studies have shown increased functional magnetic resonance
imaging (fMRI) blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) signal during working memory tasks, relative to baseline, in frontal
and parietal regions with age-related increases in working memory capacity (Crone et al., 2006; Klingberg et al., 2002; Scherf
et al., 2006). Computational modeling has further suggested that
fronto-parietal connectivity underlies inter-individual differences
in working memory capacity (Edin et al., 2007). In resting-state
connectivity studies, although somewhat controversial due to
inconsistencies in handling motion artifacts (Power et al., 2012), a
general pattern of increasing long-range connectivity with age has
been described (Dosenbach et al., 2010; Fair et al., 2007). The spatial pattern of attention networks in children 5–8 years of age has
been reported to be fragmented and incomplete compared to the
same networks seen in adults (de Bie et al., 2012). In older children,

33

while differences compared to adults in IPS-to-DPLFC connectivity
have been observed (Barber et al., 2013), other work has found no
difference in fronto-parietal functional connectivity (Jolles et al.,
2011; Uddin et al., 2011).
Several factors may contribute to variability in ﬁndings
regarding developmental changes, or age-related variability, in
fronto-parietal functional connectivity, including differential sensitivity of task compared resting scans, analysis approach, and small
sample size. Among studies that have used region-of-interest (ROI)
approaches, choice of seed region may also impact ﬁndings, as there
is considerable heterogeneity of function and connectivity within
both prefrontal (Kahnt et al., 2012; Liu et al., 2013; Moayedi et al.,
2014) and parietal (Anderson et al., 2011; Mars et al., 2011; Nelson
et al., 2010) cortices.
Developmental abnormalities in the IPS have been linked with
aberrant numerical and visuospatial cognition (Auzias et al., 2014;
Bray et al., 2011; Kesler et al., 2004, 2006; Molko et al., 2003;
Nordahl et al., 2007). Therefore, characterizing age-related variability in fronto-parietal functional connectivity is important, both
for understanding the neural basis of typical cognitive maturation, and as a baseline for comparing atypical development. The
present study investigated age-related variability in IPS functional
connectivity across childhood and adolescence, and aimed to circumvent limitations of previous work by (1) using a large database
of resting-state fMRI data, and (2) using multiple seeds along the
anterior-to-posterior axis of the IPS, in locations corresponding to
previously deﬁned IPS0-4 (Swisher et al., 2007) with well characterized patterns of structural connectivity (Bray et al., 2013b;
Greenberg et al., 2012; Szczepanski et al., 2013).
We hypothesized that IPS sub-regions would show varying
functional connectivity with visual and prefrontal regions along
the anterior-to-posterior axis, consistent with previous work (Mars
et al., 2011). Speciﬁcally, we hypothesized that anterior regions
of the IPS would be more strongly functionally connected with
frontal regions of the network including hFEF, whereas posterior
IPS regions would have greater functional connectivity with visual
regions. We further hypothesized differential age-related variability in functional connectivity. Speciﬁcally, we hypothesized that as
primary sensory brain systems have been shown to mature relatively early (Gogtay et al., 2004; Shaw et al., 2008; de Bie et al.,
2010), posterior IPS-to-occipital connectivity patterns would be
relatively stable, while anterior IPS-to-prefrontal (e.g. DLPFC Barber
et al., 2013) connectivity would show a positive association with
age.

2. Materials and methods
2.1. Participants
Typically developing (TD) participants less than 20 years of
age were included the analyses from four sites from the Autism
Brain Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE; http://fcon 1000.projects.
nitrc.org/indi/abide/) database (Di Martino et al., 2014). These four
sites included the New York University Langone Medical Centre,
University of Michigan (samples one and two), University of Utah
School of Medicine, and the Yale Child Study Centre. These sites
were chosen as they had more than 20 TD participants younger
than 20 years of age, with an age span greater than 10 years across
participants. The research protocols were approved by the institutional review board (IRB) at each site. While inclusion and exclusion
criteria differed across the sites, TD participants were generally
excluded if they had a history of neurodevelopmental or psychiatric diagnosis, neurological disorder or any contraindications for
MRI (Supplementary Table 1). Written consent and assent were
obtained as appropriate from all participants at each of the sites.

In total, 203 participants met the criteria to be included in this
study. Participants were excluded from analyses for various reasons including: 25% or more of the volumes signiﬁcantly impacted
by motion (15), poor data quality (2), and difﬁculties with data
processing (3). As a result, 183 participants (142 male, 41 female,
age range: 6.47–19.76 years) were included in the ﬁnal analysis
(Table 1). For sites where a quantitative measure was reported
for participants’ handedness, positive values were identiﬁed as
right-handed and negative values were identiﬁed as left-handed,
resulting in a binary measure of handedness. In 6 cases, handedness
was not reported; for the purposes of analyses, these participants
were categorized as right-handed. Information regarding participants’ Full Scale IQ (FIQ) scores can be found in Supplementary
Table 2; for participants included in this analysis, FIQ scores ranged
from 73 to 144.
2.2. Neuroimaging data
Neuroimaging data at each site was acquired using a 3 T MR
scanner and included T2*-weighted BOLD scans 6–10 min in length
as well as T1-weighted anatomical scans. Functional and anatomical image acquisition parameters and procedure varied by site with
image resolution varying from 3 to 4 mm3 and 1 to 1.4 mm3 for
functional (Table 2) and anatomical volumes respectively. Wholebrain T1-weighted images were used in the pre-processing of
functional images for all sites however were not analyzed.
2.3. Pre-processing
Standard pre-processing steps for fMRI analyses were conducted using SPM (http://www.ﬁl.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/software/

spm8/) software in MATLAB (Mathworks, Natick, MA). Preprocessing included: slice timing correction, realignment to the
third volume acquired, spatial smoothing using a 4 mm FWHM
Gaussian kernel, and artifact detection and repair of volumes
with more than 0.5 mm/TR of motion using the ArtRepair toolbox
(Mazaika et al., 2009). Functional images were then coregistered
to the T1-weighted images. Automatic anatomical segmentation
was performed and a 95% probability threshold was applied to
the white matter (WM) and cerebrospinal ﬂuid (CSF) masks.
These thresholded masks were used to extract mean WM and
CSF time courses from functional scans. The WM and CSF time
courses were included in a regression analysis along with the
motion parameters using in-house scripts. The residual data were
band pass ﬁltered using a low pass and high pass cutoff of 0.1
and 0.001 Hz respectively. Finally, to assist with standardizing
data across sites, all brain voxels were set to a mean of 1000
and time courses were converted to Z-scores. The functional
data were then normalized to the MNI template, resampled to
2 mm3 , and spatially smoothed using a 7 mm FWHM Gaussian kernel.

2.4. IPS region-of-interest (ROI) deﬁnition
Left and right IPS0-4 ROIs were created using the MarsBaR MATLAB toolbox (Brett et al., 2002). Spherical ROIs with a radius of
3 mm, shown in Fig. 1, were created using the locations of IPS0-4
identiﬁed in Swisher et al. (2007). These coordinates were shifted
by a maximum of 1.73 mm in order to generate ROIs of equal size
(19 voxels) (Table 3). Such an alteration in the location of each ROI
is well within the variance observed across participants (Swisher
et al., 2007).

2.5. First-level functional connectivity models
Time courses were extracted by averaging signals over voxels included in each of the 10 IPS seeds, prior to the ﬁnal spatial
smoothing step. Multiple regression models were run for each participant with each of the 10 IPS seed regions as regressors (i.e., 10
models per participant). Volumes ﬂagged as motion-corrupted by
ArtRepair software were de-weighted prior to model estimation.
Within this sample, there was no signiﬁcant relationship between
participant’s age and the percentage of fMRI volumes corrupted due
to motion (p = 0.132).

2.6. Group-level functional connectivity models
Group-level models were run for each seed separately in the
left and right hemisphere, including an intercept term as well as
effects of age and covariates of no interest: handedness, site of
data collection, whether the participants had their eyes open or
closed during the resting scan, and gender. Contrasts estimated the
average connectivity pattern for each seed and the positive and
negative associations with age. Models were also run that included
all 5 seeds in each hemisphere in order to directly compare the
connectivity patterns between seeds. Two contrasts were run, an
F-contrast to identify any target locations with varying connectivity depending on the seed, and a T-contrast to identify a linear
change in connectivity from posterior to anterior. As age-effects
on connectivity may be more pronounced in younger or older participants across this age-range, a second set of models were run
on median split data (median = 14). The younger (6–14 years) and
older (14–20 years) subgroups included 90 and 93 participants,
respectively.

As the hypothesized age-effects were not apparent at a wholebrain corrected statistical threshold, follow-up analyses were
conducted in a priori ROIs to characterize the size of age-effects
in this sample. Target ROIs were selected from a group-level model
that included all 10 seeds, using positive and negative contrasts
each averaging over all 10 seeds. Peak regions were chosen from
these two contrasts (positive and negative) at a threshold of p < 0.05
family wise error (FWE) corrected. From the positive contrast, these
generally corresponded to regions of the dorsal attention (DAN) or
fronto-parietal network (FPN; Fox et al., 2005; Power et al., 2011);
from the negative contrast, these were mainly regions that are
part of the default mode network (DMN). For each pair of ipsilateral seeds and targets, a separate linear mixed model was run
to estimate the effect of age on connectivity, with site as a grouping variable; additional covariates of no-interest included gender,
handedness and eye status (open or closed). Models were run on
the whole group (N = 183), as well as older and younger sub-groups
(N = 90, 93 respectively).

3. Results
3.1. Functional connectivity for IPS0-4
Functional connectivity patterns for IPS0-4 are shown for the
right hemisphere in Fig. 2A. Patterns were largely bilateral and
effects were similar for the left hemisphere. Consistent with previous adult and child studies, we observed positive functional
connectivity between IPS seeds and regions of the fronto-parietal or
dorsal attention network including putative human FEF, occipitotemporal cortex (near MT) and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex
(Barber et al., 2013; Farrant and Uddin, 2015; Fox et al., 2005).
Also as expected, we observed negative connectivity with regions
of the DMN including inferior parietal lobule, posterior cingulate/precuneus and medial prefrontal cortex (Fox et al., 2005;
Greicius et al., 2009).
Although there are broad similarities in connectivity patterns
across seeds, Fig. 2A suggests that there are differences in connectivity strength to both occipital and prefrontal regions. This
was tested in Fig. 2B, which shows the results of an F-contrast,
assessing the effect of seed. This conﬁrms that there are differences
in the strength of connectivity depending on the anterior-posterior
location of the seed in occipital, fusiform, dorsal prefrontal and precuneus regions. Fig. 2C shows the results of a linear contrast for
differences in connectivity along the anterior-to-posterior axis of
the IPS, which shows that anterior parietal and dorsal prefrontal
and premotor regions show stronger functional connectivity with
anterior IPS, while occipital and fusiform regions show stronger
connectivity with posterior seeds.
3.2. Age-effects
Signiﬁcant positive and negative linear effects of age for IPS
seeds are shown in Fig. 3. In the left hemisphere (left panels),
IPS0 showed a positive age-association in right temporoparietal

junction (TPJ) ([42 −36 12], n = 573, Z = 4.7), IPS2 a negative association in bilateral superior parietal cortex ([22 −48 52], n = 356,
Z = 4.2; [−24 −44 50], n = 458, Z = 4.1), and IPS3 showed a positive
age-association with right fusiform ([34 −40 −22], n = 373, Z = 4.0)
and negative with left superior parietal cortex ([−24 −44 46],
n = 376, Z = 4.2).
In the right hemisphere (right panels), IPS1 showed a negative
age-association with medial orbitofrontal cortex ([0 60 −4], n = 327,
Z = 4.2), IPS3 showed a negative association with right superior
parietal ([20 −48 50], n = 411, Z = 4.8) and IPS4 showed a positive association with bilateral fusiform ([−24 −72 −4], n = 883,
Z = 4.3;[22 −70 −6], n = 341, Z = 4.0) and negative association with
left parietal ([−26 −38 38], n = 432, Z = 4.9).
A second analysis was performed using functional runs that
were truncated to be the same length across all sites (180 volumes).
A third analysis was conducted including the percent of volumes
de-weighted due to excessive motion as a covariate in the models.
Results with these additional models were essentially the same and
are listed in Supplementary Table 3.
We note that with the exception of the IPS0-TPJ pattern, ageeffects occurred within regions that were positively or negatively
connected to the IPS seed networks, on average. The negative parietal effects were anterior to IPS4 in regions positively connected to
the seeds, on average. The positive fusiform effects were in regions
that, though more strongly connected to IPS0, were still part of the
average network for IPS3,4. The right IPS1 seed was on average negatively connected to the medial orbitofrontal region that showed a
negative age-effect.
To allow for the possibility of age-effects that differ between
adolescents and younger children, follow-up analyses were run in
younger (6–14 years, N = 90) and older (14–20 years, N = 93) subsamples. In these models, only the right IPS2 showed a signiﬁcant
positive age-effect in left fusiform ([−16 −50 −4], n = 290, Z = 3.8) in
the younger group. No other signiﬁcant effects were found in either
the younger or older sub-sample.

effects in cool colors. T-maps are thresholded at p < 0.001 and only clusters at p < 0.05 FWE corrected are shown. The functional connectivity maps for each IPS seed are
included in this ﬁgure as a dark red (positive network) and dark blue (negative network) transparent underlay. This underlay was thresholded at p < 0.001 with only clusters
at p < 0.05 FWE corrected displayed.

3.3. Target ROI deﬁnition
From contrasts averaging positive and negative effects for all 10
IPS seeds (Fig. 4A), two sets of target ROIs were deﬁned (Table 4).
From the positive contrast, these generally correspond to regions
of the dorsal attention (DAN) or fronto-parietal network (FPN; Fox
et al., 2005; Power et al., 2011), such as the DLPFC and hFEF, but
also included ventral visual (fusiform gyrus) and thalamic regions.
From the negative contrast, these were mainly regions that are part
of the default mode network (DMN).

Parameter estimates for the age regressor from the linear
mixed models with positive targets are shown in Fig. 5 (*p < 0.05,
**p < 0.005), for the whole group, younger and older sub-groups.
Over the entire sample, the only regions showing an age-regression
slope with a p-value < 0.05 were left and right fusiform, left
occipito-temporal and right peri-calcarine targets. These regions
all showed increased connectivity with age to anterior IPS regions
3 and/or 4, and left VLPFC, which showed decreasing connectivity with IPS4 with increasing age. Age-effects were generally more
positive in the younger group, with several prefrontal age-slopes
signiﬁcant at p < 0.05. In the oldest group, only left VLPFC showed
a negative slope that reached p < 0.05.

Parameter estimates for linear age-effects with negative targets
are shown in Fig. 6 (*p < 0.05, **p < 0.005). In the whole group, right
inferior parietal showed a positive linear effect of age at p < 0.05,
with right IPS4, and right middle frontal showed a signiﬁcant negative age-effect with right IPS1. In contrast to the positive targets,
which showed generally more positive effects in the younger age
group, for negative targets the older age group showed more negative age-effects.
Age-effects in Figs. 5 and 6 were relatively modest and do not
survive correction over all of the models estimated. However, visualization of parameter estimates can help to identify trends in the
data and can be informative for planning future studies.
4. Discussion
This study investigated age-related variability, across late childhood and adolescence, in functional connectivity from a set of seeds
along the posterior-to-anterior axis of the IPS. Though all IPS seeds
showed robust functional connectivity with regions of the dorsal
attention network, relative to one another, IPS0-4 have unique
functional connectivity patterns: posterior IPS shows enhanced
connectivity with dorsal and ventral visual regions, while anterior
IPS shows greater connectivity with prefrontal and sensorimotor regions. Although we hypothesized a positive association with
age speciﬁcally between anterior IPS and prefrontal regions, at a

whole-brain corrected level, age-related variability was relatively
subtle, and most prominent with ventral visual fusiform regions.
Follow-up ROI analyses showed that within the network that is
positively connected with the IPS, parameter estimates were generally more positive in the younger (6–14 years) than the older
group (14–20 years), across both prefrontal and visual targets. In
contrast, for the targets that show on average negative connectivity with the IPS, age-effects were generally more negative in the
older group. This suggests that perhaps changes in pre-adolescent
connectivity appear largely as within-network enhancement, while
across adolescence task-positive and negative networks become
more antagonistic, a hypothesis that could ideally be tested in an
independent longitudinal sample.
The main hypothesis of the present investigation, that there
is a positive association between IPS-to-prefrontal functional

connectivity with age was largely not borne out, though positive
trends were identiﬁed in ROI analyses in the younger age group.
Results from previous intrinsic functional connectivity studies have
been mixed (Barber et al., 2013; Jolles et al., 2011; Uddin et al.,
2011). Evidence supporting the hypothesis for increased frontoparietal connectivity with age comes from both the observation
that functional activation patterns in frontal and parietal cortices
increase with age and working memory capacity (Crone et al., 2006;
Klingberg et al., 2002; Scherf et al., 2006), and robust evidence
for changes in properties of fronto-parietal white matter structure
(Lebel and Beaulieu, 2011). The present study aimed to overcome possible limitations of previous work, using a relatively large
sample size, and hypothesis driven analyses that allowed for differences in functional connectivity patterns at different sites along
the IPS. A limitation of our study is the heterogeneity in acquisition

parameters across data collection sites, which may have affected
our ability to resolve age-effects.
We hypothesized that we would ﬁnd a positive association
with age between anterior IPS seeds and prefrontal regions such
as the DLPFC (Barber et al., 2013). At the whole-brain level, we
instead found positive age-associations between anterior IPS seeds
bilaterally and ventral visual fusiform regions. This was consistent with ROI analyses, which showed that across the sample
signiﬁcantly positive age-effects were largely limited to anterior
IPS to visual region connectivity, including fusiform, pericalcarine
and occipito-temporal regions. We note that though ventral visual
regions showed on average greater functional connectivity to posterior IPS0 and 1, these were also signiﬁcant in IPS3 and 4 models.
Although the dorsal and ventral visual streams are presumed to
support distinct object- and spatial-visual processing (Goodale and
Milner, 1992), they nonetheless must interact for the production of
complex behaviors (Cloutman, 2013). The ﬁnding that connectivity between anterior IPS and ventral visual regions increases over
the course of adolescence may reﬂect a maturation of complex
cognitive processes relying on dorsal-to-ventral stream interactions. However, as this ﬁnding was unexpected given our a priori
hypotheses, it should be independently replicated.
At the whole-brain level, a negative age-association was found
for right IPS1 in relation to medial orbitofrontal cortex. This region
was on average anti-correlated with the IPS1 seed and is often
included in descriptions of the default mode network (Fox et al.,
2005). Although this was a fairly restricted effect, it is consistent
with recent work showing that with increasing age, functional
networks such as the DAN and DMN become more distinct (Barber
et al., 2013; Chai et al., 2014). At the ROI level, however, we did not
ﬁnd broad age-increases in anti-correlation between the IPS and
targets in DMN-associated regions, although negative age trends
were apparent in the older sub-sample. Also at the whole-brain
level, IPS2, 3 and 4 each showed negative age-effects in anterior
superior parietal/superior post-central gyrus regions. This negative
age-effect occurred within regions that are nonetheless positively
connected with the seed regions. This pattern suggests that local
functional connectivity may be more speciﬁc/reﬁned with age in
the superior parietal cortex.
Additional positive associations with age were found, at the
whole-brain level, between left IPS0 and right superior temporal
cortex, and at the ROI level between right IPS4 and inferior parietal lobule. These ﬁndings were unexpected and challenging to
interpret, but suggest that age-effects on functional connectivity
patterns may be challenging to simplify in terms of within-network
increases and between network-decreases with age.
Increasing fronto-parietal functional connectivity with age, and
changes in white matter structure, have been suggested as a
mechanism underlying developmental increases in attentional and
working memory capacity (Edin et al., 2007; Klarborg et al., 2013;
Klingberg et al., 2002; Mabbott et al., 2006). Indeed, increased
BOLD activity in frontal and parietal regions with increased working
memory capacity has been shown in several developmental neuroimaging studies (Crone et al., 2006; Klingberg et al., 2002; Scherf
et al., 2006). Among seed regions tested here, age-related variability
in fronto-parietal resting connectivity was relatively more positive
in right IPS1 to hFEF, compared to other IPS seeds. Although previous studies have shown increases in resting connectivity between
IPS and DLPFC with age (Barber et al., 2013), we did not observe an
age-related increase in IPS to VLPFC or DLPFC connectivity across
this sample, though ROI analyses showed a positive trends with age
between left DLPFC and IPS2 in the younger sub-sample. Generally
speaking, a longitudinal or working memory task design may be
more sensitive to these effects. It is also notable that while some
studies support increased long-range connectivity with development and weakening short-range connections (Dosenbach et al.,

2010; Fair et al., 2008), studies using more stringent controls for
head motion have had more variable ﬁndings (Chai et al., 2014).
Aberrant functional connectivity of the IPS and adjacent superior and inferior parietal lobules has been reported in several
disorders affecting attention, including Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) (Nielsen et al., 2013), Turner syndrome (Bray et al.,
2011, 2013c), 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (Simon et al., 2008), children born preterm (Doesburg et al., 2013; Scheinost et al., 2014),
and Attention Deﬁcit Hyperactivity Disorder (Tomasi and Volkow,
2012). Structural and functional connectivity patterns of the IPS
suggest that this is a key node in the network of regions important for visual attention. Disruption of any one of many connections
could have an impact on functioning of the IPS, resulting in a similar
cognitive phenotype, marked by impaired attention. Future work
in this area should consider the speciﬁc location within the IPS
when assessing connectivity differences, as a body of work now
points to differential functional roles and connectivity patterns of
regions along the IPS (Anderson et al., 2010; Greenberg et al., 2012;
Mars et al., 2011). Ultimately, approaches to intervention may vary
depending on speciﬁc patterns of affected structural or functional
connectivity.
A strength of this study is the use of a set of IPS seed regions
known to have differing structural connectivity patterns. Restingstate functional connectivity analyses, including developmental
studies, have typically used either a data-driven approach, such as
ICA (e.g. Uddin et al., 2011) or a seed-based approach (e.g. Fair et al.,
2008). Here, we have used relatively small seeds deﬁned from previous functional studies. We note that despite proximity of these
seeds to one another, region-speciﬁc patterns of both connectivity
and age-related variability can be observed. These patterns would
be obscured using larger seed-regions, highlighting the importance
of choosing both the size and location of seed regions for connectivity analyses based on addressing speciﬁc hypotheses.
There are several limitations associated with this study. The
inherent limitations of resting functional connectivity have been
well described elsewhere (Buckner et al., 2013), and include: an
imperfect relationship to anatomical connections, dependence on
mental state which may differ across individuals ‘at rest’ and lack
of baseline or control condition. More speciﬁc to this study, coordinates corresponding to IPS regions 0–4 where selected from a
previous study, rather than within subject localization, potentially
contributing to heterogeneity across subjects. A related concern is
that it is not known how the size and location of these regions
might vary with age, and coordinates used here were from a study
performed in young adults. Data in this study were pooled from
several sites that used different fMRI protocols. The effect of site
was modeled in all group-level analyses, but may nonetheless have
contributed additional variability that could reduce signiﬁcance of
reported effects. For example, scan duration in this same sample
inﬂuenced the ability to classify subjects as ASD or TD based on connectivity patterns (Nielsen et al., 2013). We performed secondary
analyses on data with similar run lengths across sites, and found
largely similar effects. The sample in this study was more heavily
biased toward males, because the data were initially collected as
control samples for ASD studies. Finally, with the present approach
we cannot rule out vascular effects on age-related variability in
connectivity (Scheinost et al., 2014).

5. Conclusions
In conclusion, we present here an investigation into regionspeciﬁc age-related variability in functional connectivity along the
posterior-to-anterior axis of the IPS. The strongest positive ageeffects were observed between ventral visual and peri-calcarine
cortex and anterior IPS 3 and 4. Negative age-effects were most

prominent in anterior superior parietal cortex. Our results suggest
that IPS functional connectivity is largely established by age 6, but
that this network nonetheless undergoes connectivity maturation,
which may play an important role in cognitive maturation across
this period. The ﬁndings presented here lay a critical foundation for
studying divergent patterns of connectivity, and effects of age, in
populations with structural or functional abnormalities in the IPS
(Bray et al., 2011; Keehn et al., 2013; Tomasi and Volkow, 2012).
