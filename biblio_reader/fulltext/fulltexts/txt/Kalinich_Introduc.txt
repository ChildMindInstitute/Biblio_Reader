Summary

The basic objective of Data-Intensive Sciences (DIS) is to infer
knowledge from the integrated data organized in networked
infrastructures such as warehouses, grids, clouds. Open
access to large volumes of data therefore becomes a key
prerequisite for discoveries in the 21st century.

Motivation

D. Kovalev

We have to do better at producing tools to support the whole
research cycle – from data capture and data curation to data
analysis and data visualization.
— Jim Gray, 2007

New tools are needed to bring humans into the data-analysis
loop at all stages, recognizing that knowledge is often
subjective and context-dependent and that some aspects of
human intelligence will not be replaced anytime soon by
machines.

• Scientific inquiry proceeds by formulating a hypothesis in a

form that could conceivably be falsified by a test on
observable data.
• A test that could and does run contrary to predictions of

the hypothesis is taken as a falsification of the hypothesis.
• A test that could but does not run contrary to the

• Usually, statistical hypothesis testing is used:
• Null and alternative hypothesis are stated;
• The null hypothesis states that there is no relationship
between the phenomena (variables) whose relation is under
investigation, or at least not of the form given by the
alternative hypothesis.
• Rejecting the null hypothesis suggests that the alternative
hypothesis may be true

time. Not injected response time – 1.2 s. The mean of the 100
injected rats’ response time is 1.05 s. with a sample standard
deviation of 0.5 s. Does the drug have the effect on response
time?

Spain) during the period between 1993 and 2007
Stated null hypothesis (successive prices changes are
independent (random walk)) and alternative hypothesis
(they are dependent)

Build public mood time series by sentiment analysis of
tweets from February 28, 2008 to December 19, 2008

2

Null hypothesis states that the mood time series do not
predict DJIA values

3

Granger causality analysis in which Dow Jones values and
mood time series are correlated is used to test the null
hypothesis

• Role of hypotheses in DIR is emphasized
• Basic concepts defining the role of hypotheses in the

formation of scientific knowledge and organization of the
scientific experiments are presented
• Basic approaches for hypothesis formulation applying

logical reasoning, various methods for hypothesis
modeling and testing (including classical statistics,
Bayesian hypothesis and parameter estimation methods,
hypothetico-deductive approaches) are presented

• Facilities are aimed at the conceptualization of scientific

experiment, hypothesis formulation and browsing in
various domains (including biology, biomedical
investigations, neuromedicine, astronomy), automatic
organization of hypothesis-driven experiments
• Examples of scientific researches applying hypotheses

include modeling of population and structure synthesis of
the Galaxy, connectome-related hypothesis testing,
studying of temperature trends in Australia, analysis of
stock markets applying the EMH

Definitions for Climate Hypothesis

D. Kovalev

Definition

Appendix

Non-stationarity means that the level of the time series is not
stable in time and can show increasing and decreasing trends
Definition
I(1) means that by differentiating the stochastic process a
stationary process (main statistical properties of the series
remain unchanged) is obtained
