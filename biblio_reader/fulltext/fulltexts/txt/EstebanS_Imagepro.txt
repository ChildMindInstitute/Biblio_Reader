Introduction
As humans, we can identify galaxies light years away and we can study particles smaller than an atom,
but we still haven’t unlocked the mystery of the 3 lbs. of matter that sits between our ears.
Barack Obama, President of the United States, April 2013

Technological development applied in neuroscience is enabling unprecedented advances in a field
that has been challenging the limits of our knowledge for centuries. Although the human brain has
attracted more attention than any other organ system, it remains the least known. As a consequence,
the nervous system is associated with the largest list of incurable diseases, from which only some have
a widely accepted cause and/or agreed indicators.
In 2005, the term connectome was simultaneously introduced by (Hagmann, 2005) and (Sporns
et al., 2005) to refer to the comprehensive mapping of structural pathways that connect the different
anatomical areas in the brain. Since then, the concept has been updated and broadened to cover other
physiological elements in which the value is not (only) in the elements themselves, rather than the
relationships between them. For instance, the functional connectomes (mapping the activity of the
brain) are widely accepted and investigated nowadays. Additionally, the molecular connectivity is also
promising to outburst soon. Establishing the links between the three connectivity levels (structural,
functional, and further, molecular) stands at the horizon that will support the research activity for
the connectome mapping (Bargmann and Marder, 2013).
One recent proof of this growing interest on this new area of connectomics is the announcement of
two significant research projects in Europe and the United States: the Human Brain Project (HBP)
(Markram, 2012), and the Brain Research through Advancing Innovative Neurotechnologies (BRAIN)
initiative (Obama, 2013), respectively. Whereas the two projects aim at unveiling how individual brain
cells and complex neural circuits interact at the speed of thought, they diverge on the approach, and
focus on different applications. On one hand, the HBP will apply the resulting insights for modeling
the human brain function, and for developing novel computational systems inspired on these models.
On the other, BRAIN is more oriented to the clinical application, set after the discovery and cataloging
of “neurophenotypes” that promise to transform the way we study the healthy and diseased brain.
Moreover, these two projects are only the latest ones to complement a number of ongoing research
efforts that already keep the field highly active. A list of these projects is provided in Table 1.1.
Notwithstanding some criticism over the connectome mapping, and albeit with limitations, such maps
will reveal essential characteristics of neural circuits that would otherwise be inaccessible (Morgan
and Lichtman, 2013).
As regards structural connectivity, the “wiring map” of the brain can be observed at a wide range
of scales depending on the pursued insights (Craddock et al., 2013). Regardless the chosen scale, the
procedure fulfills the following general pattern. Data collection involves sensing the target feature,
structuring and compressing the information gathered, and finally storing the contents in digital
objects. Most of the sources for data acquisition are imaging techniques (microscopy (Lichtman et al.,
2008), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (Hagmann et al., 2012), functional MRI (fMRI) (Smith,
2012), digitalized histology (Kleinfeld et al., 2011), etc.), but there also exist other possibilities (i.e.
electroencefalogram (EEG) and magentoencefalogram (MEG) records, etc.). An ambitious effort to
comprehensive data acquisition is leaded by the Human Connectome Project (HCP) (Van Essen et al.,
2012). The second step deals with building up the brain network from retrieved data. In the case
of imaging data, as it is the aim of this work, it includes reconstruction, modeling, segmentation,
registration, tractography, tract parcellation/clustering, and network set up (Daducci et al., 2012).

CHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTION

Finally, the last step looks for meaningful insights from the networks with mathematical and statistical
analyses (Sporns, 2012).
To narrow down the broad field of connectomics, the present work will be restricted to the extraction of human connectomes from in vivo diffusion MRI (dMRI) data. Therefore, the PhD Thesis
presented in this document is aimed at improving the current dMRI-based mapping techniques and
at enabling reliable analyses of the brain networks. The described framework is designed for studying
the structural connectivity at the macro-scale. The scale is defined by the current imaging techniques,
that in the case of dMRI reaches a typical resolution of 2.0mm × 2.0mm × 2.0mm. Considering that
1.0mm3 volume might hold around 105 axons (Aboitiz et al., 1992), it is obvious that millions of
axons are to be integrated at the dMRI scale of analysis. Therefore, the target features for analysis
are the whole-brain network properties, with special attention to the discovery and characterization
of network modules. Modularity is important due to several reasons (Sporns, 2013): 1) modules are
the key point when trying to bridge the structural topology to the prominent functional subdivisions;
2) clustering the network in modules will allow for statistical analyses and comparisons; 3) network
modules are the needed atoms for finding subject- and group-wise characteristic patterns; 4) using
modules it will be possible to reduce the network information by compression and/or modular decomposition; 5) modules are necessary to step down the scale pyramid to understand the roles of edges
(fiber bundles) and nodes (cortical regions) within the global network topology, the so-called community concept (Guimerà and Amaral, 2005); and, 6) checking that networks theory fulfills, showing that
human brain uses modularity as a strategy for robust network function (Kashtan and Alon, 2005).
On the other hand, a wide number of limitations bound the impacts and outcomes of magnetic
resonance (MR) connectomics. From data acquisition to network analysis, a large queue of chained
processing tasks demands for new or improved methodologies that increase the overall accuracy (i.e.
precision) and reliability (i.e. repeatability, and robustness). Comprehensive descriptions of these
limitations are found in (Hagmann et al., 2010; Jones and Cercignani, 2010; Jbabdi and JohansenBerg, 2011) and will be introduced in Chapter 2 along with a discussion of the state of the art
regarding dMRI basic concepts, the connectome generation methodologies, and the key points along
the processing pipeline that will be investigated in the PhD Thesis. Chapter 3 details the objectives
of the proposed PhD Thesis regarding the proposed contributions, with novel processing techniques
to address certain weak points along the state-of-art pipelines for connectivity mapping. Chapter 4
reviews the work plan to achieve the objectives, and Chapter 5 deals with the resources and needs
necessary to carry the project out.

Goals
Aims to collect a large-scale imaging data set to explore brainbehavior relationships and their genetic influences. The initiative has collected resting-state
fMRI (R-fMRI), dMRI and saliva samples from over 3,000 adults, along with
comprehensive phenotyping data (cognition, personality and lifestyle), and
the resultant repository containing 1,500 completed, quality-pass data sets is
expected to be publicly available in 2013.
Attempts to characterize brain networks with multimodal neuroimaging techniques, from the microscale (microtechnique, ultramicrotomy, staining and visualization techniques) to the macroscale (electroencephalography, fMRI and
dMRI). R-fMRI and diffusion-imaging data sets, along with behavioral and
blood data from more than 1,000 patients with schizophrenia, 300 patients
with Alzheimer’s disease and mild cognitive impairment, 120 patients who
had a stroke, 50 patients with glioma and 2,000 healthy controls collected
from 11 hospitals and imaging centers.
Consortium focused on studying the brain’s microstructure, tracts and connectivity using dMRI. Target deliverables include optimized acquisition protocols,
analytic tools and a connectivity atlas.

Initiative to comprehensively map and model the human connectome for 1,000
babies, including in utero and in vivo imaging (2044 weeks after conception).
State-of-the-art multimodal imaging initiative (R-fMRI, task-based fMRI (TfMRI), dMRI and magnetoencephalography) that makes use of a twin design
(1,200 healthy adults, including twin pairs and their siblings from 300 families)
to provide insights into relationships between brain connectivity, behavior and
genetics. The project uses multiband imaging sequences for R-fMRI (high
spatial and temporal resolution) and dMRI (high spatial resolution), which it
has refined and is currently distributing to interested centers. All data and
tools developed through the initiative will be openly shared.
Initiative focusing on unraveling the full connectivity map using the first ’Connectome Scanner’, which is designed to carry out diffusion using ultrahigh
gradient strength (48 times the strength of conventional systems). Efforts
to optimize dMRI technology will focus on increasing the spatial resolution,
quality and speed of acquisition.
Grass-roots data-sharing initiative that brought together over 1,200 previously
collected R-fMRI data sets from 33 independent sites around the world and
released them openly to the scientific community via the Neuroimaging Informatics Tool Resources Clearinghouse (NITRC), http://www.nitrc.org/.
Second FCP initiative that was founded in an attempt to (i) expand
the scope of open data sharing in the functional neuroimaging community to include phenotypic data beyond age and sex (major INDI data
releases: ADHD-200 Consortium (http://fcon_1000.projects.nitrc.org/
indi/adhd200/), the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE; http:
//con_1000.projects.nitrc.org/indi/abide/)) and (ii) provide a model
for prospective, prepublication data sharing (major release: the Nathan
Kline Institute-Rockland Sample http://fcon_1000.projects.nitrc.org/
indi/enhanced/). More than 5,000 R-fMRI data sets are available through
the FCP and INDI efforts combined as well as a growing number of dMRI
data sets.
Building on an existing long-term prospective epidemiological study that has
collected genetics, blood samples and lifestyle information from a cohort
of 500,000 subjects, the UK Biobank Imaging Extension aims to resample
100,000 of the cohort using multimodal neuroimaging (including but not limited to R-fMRI and dMRI), as well as cardiac MRI and rich phenotyping.

Background and state of the art
2.1

From physiology to diffusion MRI connectomics

Diffusion MRI is a widely used family of MRI techniques (Sundgren et al., 2004) which accounts for a
growing interest in its application to structural connectivity analyses of the brain at the macro-scale
(Craddock et al., 2013). By exploiting the data in diffusion MRI (dMRI), it is possible to derive the
local axonal structure at each imaging voxel (Basser and Pierpaoli, 1996) and estimate a whole-brain
mapping of fiber tracts (Hagmann et al., 2012; Johansen-Berg and Rushworth, 2009) represented by
trajectories reconstructed from the local information. The analysis of dMRI-derived connectomes is
a promising tool for neuroscience in general (Bullmore and Sporns, 2009), but also for the clinical
application in particular (Griffa et al., 2013).
Although the explosion of dMRI to probe the diffusion restriction patterns within the brain is
relatively recent, the study of structural development and topological patterns of brain networks
started earlier. In 1997, Van Essen published a tension-based theory for morphogenesis and compact
wiring in the central nervous system (Van Essen, 1997). This paper hypothesized that in the cerebral
cortex, tension along axons in the white matter (WM) can explain how and why the cortex folds
in a characteristic species-specific pattern. Therefore, it set a basis for shifting neuroimaging from
“blob-ology” (specialization/segregation) towards “connectology” (integration). The success of the
foundations presented by (Van Essen, 1997) have been lately recalled and confirmed by (Wedeen
et al., 2012), that claimed a grid topology pattern for the networks of the brain. Therefore, the
underlying developmental principles relating cortical features with the internal “wiring” of the brain
served as trail head for a whole new line of research aiming at mapping all measurable features of the
cortex (thickness, gyrification, volume, surface, etc.). Moreover, (Passingham et al., 2002) established
the first demonstration of the anatomical support for the functional localization of the cortex. They
used the CoCoMac database (Stephan et al., 2001) to extract unique cortico-cortical connectivity
patterns. As a consequence, this “connectional fingerprint” further influences the functional properties
of brain regions. These efforts resulted in an explosion of computational tools (for instance, (Fischl
and Dale, 2000; Van Essen et al., 2001)), and the opening of the still emerging neuroinformatics field.
Soon, connectivity analyses of the brain restricted to selected regions of interest using dMRI data
were widespread. (Behrens et al., 2003) presented a prominent work in that direction, identifying
specific connections between the human thalamus and cortex, and unveiling distinct subregions whose
locations corresponded to nuclei previously described in histological studies. A review of the state of
the art at that time is presented in (Parker, 2004).
In 2005, Sporns et al. and Hagmann started an “-omics” race as regards connectivity mapping,
with their independent works (Sporns et al., 2005; Hagmann, 2005). These are the first reports linking
the brain structural insights and the global network viewpoint, postulating dMRI as the best indicated
imaging modality. However, the first relevant report assessing whole-brain connectivity was carried
out using only classical T1 weighted MRIs, rather than dMRI, due to the great unreliability of the
existing early methodologies (among other factors). (He et al., 2007) analyzed 124 human T1 scans of
the brain from the International Consortium for Brain Mapping database (ICBM), implicitly assuming
Van Essen’s hypothesis, as they built the brain networks on top of the inter-regional correlations of
cortical thickness maps. In another example (Sanabria-Diaz et al., 2010) the cortical surface is also
applied to build up the networks. Therefore, they related the axonal development with the final
morphology of the cortical sheet. Since 2005, the connectivity mapping pipelines (e.g. (Daducci et al.,
2012)) are defined with fine detail (see figure 2.1 for a brief description, and section 2.3 for the full
description), but techniques still demand for significant efforts in improving the image processing side.

CHAPTER 2. BACKGROUND AND STATE OF THE ART

Figure 2.1: Generic flowchart of the structural MRI connectivity pipelines. Extracting
the connectome comprises a large set of image processing techniques. On one side, it is necessary
to provide an anatomically precise and correct reference for further analysis (Morphology block, left
side). This is achieved mainly with a T1 study. Additional MRI datasets can be available, such as
T2 scans or gradient-phase mappings of the field (top right within the morphology box, T2 scan and
field map with magnitude depicted in the top-left of the diagonal and phase on the bottom-right).
From these datasets (generally T1-only), a set of computational methods are applied to extract the
anatomical information (bottom-row of morphology box). Some of these features are cortical thickness
maps, cortical parcellation (i.e. regions that will support the nodes of the network), segmentation of
brain tissues and subcortical regions, etc. On the other hand, the information to be extracted from the
diffusion data (labeled as dMRI in the right-side box) are maps of scalar features and the tractography
(the whole-brain tracking of diffusion directions representing the fiber bundles). The dMRI volume
has been represented with the B0 volume overlaid over 3 exemplary directions extracted from a larger
dataset to illustrate the nature of DWI. By means of image registration techniques, it is possible to
fuse the anatomical information onto the diffusion information. In the case of early networks built on
cortical thickness correlations the diffusion branch is omitted (He et al., 2007). Finally, the main results
are a network matrix (an abstract summary of the nodes and their connections) and representations
of the network topology that have into account the anatomical information. On top of these two tools,
a wide range of analyses and comparisons have been proposed on the area of connectivity analysis
(blue box).

Early dMRI research mainly focused on the improvements of imaging techniques by a better understanding of the diffusion effect, and improving image reconstruction methodologies. Currently, the
connectome extraction and analysis relies on a large chain of sophisticated computational methods including acquisition, reconstruction, modeling and model fitting, image segmentation and registration,
fibre tracking, connectivity mapping, visualization, statistical group studies, and inference (figure 2.5).
This growing complexity has given rise to challenging issues towards reliable structural information
about the neuronal tracts presented in, and also difficulties on the statistical analysis (Meskaldji et al.,

et al., 2012; Jones et al., 2013) are scarce, and shallow due to the complete absence of comprehensive

Introduction to diffusion MRI

DMRI data are usually acquired with EPI sequences as they allow for very fast acquisition of large sets
of slices each acquired after a single excitation (Mukherjee et al., 2008). EPI volumes are collected
in sequence and each one represents one probed diffusion direction. The outcome of acquisition is
called raw data or diffusion signal, and it packs a stack of 3D sequential volumes associated with a
corresponding vector (with respect the scan system coordinates). The so-called b-vector informs about
the direction sampled. All the b-vectors are stacked in a table that has been coined B-matrix. A brief
description of the most relevant parameters in dMRI acquisition is presented in Table 2.1.

2.3. THE CONNECTOME PIPELINE

One or more volumes without directional encoding (so-called baseline, b = 0, low b, or just B0
volumes) are interleaved as reference (one every 5 or 10 directions is recommended). At the least, one
B0 should be acquired at the beginning of the EPI dataset. The number of sampled directions is mostly
defined depending on the scanning time constraints and the intended model fitting methodology. For
instance, a typical diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) dataset would comprehend 30 directions, with a
scanning time around 5 min. These 30 directions plus one B0 interleaved every 10 directions would
produce a 4D volume of 33 3D slices and a B-matrix of 33 × 3 elements. As the B0 volumes are
acquired without angular direction gradient, they show a “T2-like” contrast (this similarity is shown
in B) and D) of figure 2.2).
EPI are known to suffer from geometrical distortions and artifacts due to, chiefly, three sources:
the subject motion in between acquiring different sampling directions, the induced Eddy currents on
the scanner coils due to the gradient switching (O’Brien et al., 2013), and, finally, distortions caused by
the magnetic susceptibility inhomogeneity present at the interfaces between tissues. A comprehensive
study of EPI distortion is presented in (Andersson and Skare, 2010). As we shall encounter, B0susceptibility distortions will be one of the central topics of interest for the present work, and it will
be further reviewed in subsection 2.4.1. As a brief introduction, susceptibility distortions happen
along the phase-encoding direction, and are most appreciable in the frontal lobes of the brain due to
proximity of an air/tissue interface located around the sinuses. Two implications are associated to
this artifact: the signal loss caused on highly distorted regions, and a significant added difficulty in
registering with structural images (e.g. T1-weighted). A visual description of this pitfall is shown in
figure 2.2, box C).
After correcting for artifacts, the difficulty of performing analyses directly on the directionally
dependent raw data is not affordable. Thus, dMRI data is reconstructed using one of a numerous
set of readily available algorithms. The outcome is a voxel-wise model of diffusion shape. On top of
the chosen model, some scalar maps describing tissue features is generally computed. For instance,
the most popular dMRI-derived scalar map is fractional anisotropy (FA) which depicts the isotropy
of water diffusion inside the brain. Another widely studied map is the apparent diffusion coefficient
(ADC) (or mean diffusivity (MD) that has a dual definition), which reflects the intensity of the diffusion
effect. Many other directionally invariant measurements have been defined. For a comprehensive
study, please refer to (Ennis and Kindlmann, 2006).
Alongside distortions and direction dependency, dMRI data is affected by partial volume effects
(PVEs) (Alexander et al., 2001) that appear when several tissues, or signal emitters, are present in the
same imaging unit, producing an averaged intensity. The effect is directly related to the low resolution
achievable with dMRI (typically around 2.0 × 2.0 × 2.0mm3 ). An additional complication specific to
dMRI is the CSF contamination (Metzler-Baddeley et al., 2012), given that the signal sensed at the
voxel is modulated by the diffusion response, causing that CSF contribution is significantly favored
versus WM or GM contributions in voxels located at region boundaries.

2.3.1

The connectome pipeline
Overview

The big picture of the image processing workflow for computing human connectomes from MRI data
is presented in figure 2.1. Saving for some exceptions as the one mentioned before (He et al., 2007),
the general standpoint concerns three major areas that might be described as follows:
Diffusion MRI data dMRI is the main source of information for the identification and location of
the brain “wiring” and therefore, it supposes a major area within the connectome mapping framework.
Starting from the raw dMRI data, the first step is fitting a model of orientation of the fibers at each
voxel. The simplest model is the widely used tensor model (Basser and Pierpaoli, 1996) that provides
DTI images, and requires probing a minimum of 6 independent directions. Many other models have
been further proposed (Tuch et al., 2002; Tuch, 2004; Wedeen et al., 2005; Tournier et al., 2007;
Canales-Rodrı́guez et al., 2009) among others. The models try to advance the current methodologies
in two possible lines: either they try to achieve a higher angular resolution (usually increasing the
number of directions and acquisition time), or they aim at improving the efficiency of the algorithms
(to lower the number of directions and acquisition time) without significant loss of angular resolution.
The angular resolution is the minimum angle of two crossing fibers (at a certain voxel) that the
algorithm is able to discriminate.
After the model is computed, then a second step called tractography performs the identification
and location of streamlines that integrate some millions of axons with identical orientation. These

streamlines represent the fiber pathways, and it is important to recall that they do not represent
single axons, as dMRI senses the anatomy of the brain at the macro-scale. Further advances on
tractography derived on other possible representations of the fiber tracts, as probabilistic tractography.
Tractography has evolved from local to global. The early tractography methods (both streamline and
probabilistic tractographies) use a seed point and build the connectivity from it. In order to find
whole-brain tractography, these algorithms set a certain number of seeds at every WM voxel to capture
all the possible tracts. Currently, tractography is evolving to global methods that are expected to
improve notably the outcome by using global information, but still one important limitation is the
WM segmentation.

Morphological data However, dMRI suffers from several issues, previously described in section 2.2,
that demand for the fusion of other sources of information. Moreover, the neuroimaging knowledge
gathered in the past decades of intensive research is mostly framed into the prominent T1 weighted
MRI. This family of images has been deeply studied and subjected to uncountable analyses. Thus,
such a rich source of information about morphology is mapped from the T1 reference image into the
dMRI. Other usual sources of anatomical information that can be incorporated to the diffusion data
are T2 weighted images and/or estimations of magnitude and phase of the magnetic field inside the
scanned field of view (FoV) (the so-called “fieldmap”). Most often, the morphological data plays
an important role for the following tasks: 1) the use of the fieldmap to correct for susceptibility
distortions; 2) provide the tractography algorithm with a precise stopping criteria in the form of WM
segmentation; and 3) impose a division of the cortex into meaningful areas, the so-called cortical
parcellation. These three needs will be covered in section 2.4.

Analysis of resulting networks The final output of the connectome mapping workflows is a
network. The cortical parcellation is used to define the nodes of the network, at a specified resolution
(see figure 2.3), and the edges are extracted from the streamlines connecting those nodes. Therefore,
the objective of these workflows is building up a graph representing the network. On top of that, in this
last analysis step, the graph is statistically analyzed, and visualized, to extract as much information
as possible from the network. Simple visualization can provide very valuable interpretation of the
resulting connectomes, for some examples, please see figure 2.4. On the other hand, pattern recognition
and statistical comparison of connectomes will require a concerted effort directed at data analysis and
reduction, as well as computational modeling (Sporns, 2013). The complexity of the networks, the
multi-scale analysis, and the massive amount of necessary comparisons that dramatically hinders
analysis power are demanding for new methodologies and strategies (Meskaldji et al., 2013).

Existing computational tools for the dMRI-specific workflows

In figure 2.5, a fully detailed flowchart of the dMRI connectome pipeline is presented, highlighting the
modules that the present work will address. The pipeline is general enough to represent the current
trends, indicating the most common names for each of the connecting processing nodes. Generally
speaking, researchers build up the pipeline selecting the appropriate tool from an enormous catalog
of available software packages. The review presented in (Soares et al., 2013) could be considered an
updated and comprehensive (with some relevant absences, it must be noted) picture of this catalog.
Another survey the existing software tools is presented in (Hasan et al., 2011). Numerous pipelines
covering part or the whole necessary tasks of the dMRI workflow have been released during the last
years as: the connectome mapper (CMP) (Daducci et al., 2012), 3D Slicer (Fedorov et al., 2012),

2.4

Open challenges in the connectome mapping

All the available dMRI-derived models and scalar maps are very sensitive to distortions, PVE, noise
and axonal dispersion (Jbabdi and Johansen-Berg, 2011), what yields numerous challenges in the

12

CHAPTER 2. BACKGROUND AND STATE OF THE ART

Figure 2.5: Specific flowchart of the dMRI connectivity pipelines. Any high-standard software pipeline should integrate the following processing units. As dMRI data are generally affected
by distortion, the first block sequentially corrects for motion, Eddy currents, and susceptibility artifacts. Motion correction is usually performed with a rigid registration of every sampled direction to
a reference B0. The resulting rotations are then applied to the associated B-matrix, as it has been
proven to be necessary (Leemans and Jones, 2009). Once the rigid components of the registration
have been removed, an affine registration (or more complex methodologies (O’Brien et al., 2013))
is performed to deal with Eddy currents derived distortions. The last module of artifact correction
addresses the susceptibility induced deformations, marked in orange color because it shall be covered
in subsection 2.4.1. The following prominent module is reconstruction of directionally independent
information from the raw dMRI data. As outcome, a voxel-wise model of the fiber orientation is
obtained, and a set of scalar maps depicting features of interest based on the fiber orientation model.
Then, the model is fed an appropriate tractography algorithm. As (Jbabdi and Johansen-Berg, 2011)
recall, these algorithms recover very successfully those streamlines where fibers are clearly aligned, but
usually fail in those voxels where the model depicts more complex situations (fiber fanning, kissing,
bending, crossing, etc.). One derived problem is the enormous difficulty at detecting with accuracy
and reliably the locations at which the streamlines project into the GM sheet. Therefore, tractography
is aided by a segmentation to as stopping criteria. The segmentation can be obtained from registered
structural information. Finally, the connectivity matrix is generated with a cortical parcellation that
usually is registered from the structural reference.

processing tasks (artifact correction, segmentation, registration and parcellation) presented in figure 2.5. Additionally, as a result, a vast number of challenges and pitfalls emerge regarding accuracy
(correctness) and precision (reproducibility) of tractography-based analyses (Jones et al., 2013) and
subsequent connectome analyses.
Moreover, the problems of precise segmentation in dMRI-space and the spatial mapping between
these contours and the corresponding surfaces in anatomical images bear significant redundancy. Once
the spatial relationship between T1 and dMRI space is established, the contours which are readily
available in T1 space can simply be projected on to the dMRI data. Conversely, if a precise delineation
in dMRI space was achieved, the spatial mapping with T1-space could be derived from one-to-one
correspondences on the contours. However, neither segmentation nor registration can be performed
flawlessly, if considered independently.
The proposed PhD Thesis will investigate the fundamentals of dMRI data and processing methodologies in order to improve the accuracy and reliability of connectome extraction, in the highly coupled
areas of: susceptibility distortion correction (subsection 2.4.1), segmentation (subsection 2.4.2), and
structural information co-registration (subsection 2.4.3). These blocks are highlighted in orange color
within the general framework in figure 2.5. Comprehensive summary tables of applications on the
three challenging tasks are presented in Table 2.2, Table 2.3, and Table 2.4, respectively.

2.4.1

Correction for susceptibility distortions

The distortion induced by the inhomogeneity of the magnetic susceptibility at tissue interfaces was
first introduced in section 2.2, and it is visually illustrated in figure 2.2 (subfigures B, and C). The
degradation effects introduced by this artifact severely impact the outcome in a negative manner, due
to the geometrical incorrectness and the signal destruction (also called signal dropout).
The problem of retrospective correction of susceptibility distortion took rise with the initial and

2.4. OPEN CHALLENGES IN THE CONNECTOME MAPPING

wide application of EPI sequences in fMRI. All the methodologies proposed require the acquisition of
additional MRI data. The first family of solutions (Jezzard and Balaban, 1995; Jezzard et al., 1998;
Reber et al., 1998) used a fast GRE sequence to map the phase variation of the actual magnetic field
inside the scanner. Based on the theory underlying the susceptibility distortion, these fieldmap-based
techniques are able to correct only for the geometrical deformation. The signal dropout is usually
corrected using the Jacobian of the displacement field.
Almost contemporaneously, (Robson et al., 1997) proposed the use of point-spread function (PSF)
maps. Again, the acquisition of additional MRI data is required and correction is performed based
on the theoretical behaviour of distortion. PSF mapping-based techniques are able to correct for
geometrical deformations and signal dropout. (Zaitsev et al., 2004) combined the PSF mapping and
fieldmap-based techniques for enhancing results.
Some methods were proposed acquiring extra data with variations from the standard EPI schemes.
(Cordes et al., 2000) required the acquisition of an extra EPI instance with inversed phase-encoding
direction (gradient increments are set in the opposite direction), and (Chiou and Nalcioglu, 2000)
simultaneously proposed a very similar method. Extensions of these methods were presented by
(Andersson et al., 2003; Holland et al., 2010).
Finally, a prominent family of correction methods are those that use image registration with
anatomically correct MRI data. Early proposals (Kybic et al., 2000; Studholme et al., 2000) used
T2-weighted MRI due to the similarity of intensity distribution with the B0 distribution. Further
works on this line were presented in (Li et al., 2007; Tao et al., 2009). As the second contribution of
this PhD Thesis will cover registration, methods based on this technique shall be covered with detail
in subsection 2.4.3.
Other retrospective methodologies do not make use of extra MRI data, as explicitly modeling the
distortion (Andersson et al., 2001). Recently, (Andersson et al., 2012) proposed a probabilistic framework for simultaneous correction of distortions generated by the three main sources of inconsistency
(subject motion, Eddy currents, and susceptibility inhomogeneities).
As regards evaluation, (Zeng and Constable, 2002) compared the performance of fieldmap-based
and PSF-based methods. More recently, a comparison of fieldmap-based and T2-registration techniques is found in (Wu et al., 2008). This study claims that fieldmap-based are not accurate and
reliable, even though the method is theoretically correct in principle. The conclusion was later confirmed by (Tao et al., 2009). Additional concerns regarding fieldmap correction are the requirement
of extra ad-hoc acquisitions (that is not always met or it is impractical in clinical protocols), or the
accuracy of the measured fieldmap that is sensitive to various effects (such us respiration, blood flow,
etc.). All these factors have turned susceptibility distortion in EPI sequences an active field of research for the last 15 years, as shown in Table 2.2. Evaluation of the impact of these distortions on
the outcome of tractography (and subsequent network analyses) is a recent topic of interest, and first
studies are currently being published (Irfanoglu et al., 2012).

CHAPTER 2. BACKGROUND AND STATE OF THE ART

Diffusion MRI segmentation

Brain tissue segmentation stands for the precise delineation of the CSF, GM and WM regions. This
processing task has been covered with detail on T1 data of the brain, and, with less interest, in some
other modalities. In this subsection, we shall see that few studies have tried to successfully tackle this
task in dMRI. Most of the connectivity pipelines make use of the highly precise segmentation obtained
by readily available software for T1 (figure 2.2-B for an instance). After obtaining the segmentation
in T1-space, it needs to be registered to the dMRI as we shall cover in subsection 2.4.3. Nonetheless,
it is pertinent to quickly review the state of the art as regards, at the least, WM segmentation.
Tractography generally needs for a WM segmentation with sub-pixel resolution, as it provides
with precise CSF, GM and WM interfacing surfaces. The main reason is that, whereas tractography
algorithms are very good at estimating the location of bundles in deep WM, they are not good (yet) at
identifying where the tracts project into the GM (the limitations on the termination criteria, (Jbabdi
and Johansen-Berg, 2011; Craddock et al., 2013)). Thus, a WM segmentation is required by most
of the available tractography algorithms to filter the resulting tractogram. The GM-WM interface is
necessary to locate the starting and ending points of the detected fiber bundles, and CSF-WM surface
is critical for pruning spurious and discontinued fiber bundles (denoted in figure 2.5 as fiber filtering).
A visual description of this effect is provided in figure 2.6.

Figure 2.6: Impact of segmentation on tractography. Close up of the prefrontal area of the FA
map of a real DTI dataset. Contours for two different types of mask have been depicted with dashed
lines. In yellow, the one corresponding to a voxel-wise binary mask. In blue, the contour mapped from
a high resolution anatomical image. Streamlines in red color (C) are directly pruned when using a
binary mask even though they represent valid fiber paths. In contrast, A and B are accepted in both
cases (binary mask and T1-derived contour), but for the case of the binary mask, the intersection
points are not correctly located.
A number of methodologies have been proposed for dMRI segmentation, ranging from intensity
thresholding to atlas-based segmentation (see Table 2.3 for a summary). The first approach is performed simply thresholding the FA map firstly described in section 2.2. Although this methodology
was popular among the pioneer tractography studies, they were generally limited to certain regions
or significant fiber tracts, normally selected in a way that avoids problematic regions with distortions
or difficult to segment. Early approaches to dMRI segmentation include level set formulations using
scalar maps of direction invariants derived from the tensor model (Zhukov et al., 2003), directly on
the diffusion raw data (Rousson et al., 2004), or finding alternative diffusion representations (Jonasson et al., 2007). Iterative clustering performed on the B0 volumes of dMRI data was proposed by
(Hadjiprocopis et al., 2005). Later studies investigated the application of probabilistic frameworks
combining mixtures of gaussians, Markov Random Field (MRF) and labeling fusion techniques (Liu
et al., 2007) using as features widely-used dMRI-derived scalar maps as FA or MD. A similar framework
combining co-registered structural information (T1 weighted) with independent orthogonal invariants
derived from the dMRI tensor model was proposed by (Awate et al., 2008). Some proposals suggest
the use of the raw diffusion data (directionally dependent) to avoid fitting a certain model (Lu et al.,

2.4. OPEN CHALLENGES IN THE CONNECTOME MAPPING

15

2008). In (Han et al., 2009), graph-cuts voxel-based techniques are proposed using the most common
DTI-derived scalar features. Further developments of the probabilistic approach have been proposed
adding more scalar maps as features, and a more detailed treatment of PVE (Kumazawa et al., 2010).
None of the presented methods have claimed for definite results, mainly due to the lack of a goldstandard evaluation methodology. Most of them are tested only on certain regions, or do not provide
sub-pixel resolution results (Hadjiprocopis et al., 2005; Liu et al., 2007; Awate et al., 2008; Lu et al.,
2008; Han et al., 2009). Moreover, results achieved with T1 registration (subsection 2.4.3) are usually
more compelling, thus limiting significantly the research activity towards dMRI segmentation. However, recently (Kumazawa et al., 2013) proposed to include this task within reconstruction algorithms.
Finally, some golden-standard evaluation frameworks for task-based validation have been proposed
for the segmentation results (e.g. lesion detection in visceral organs (Jha et al., 2012)).

Method description
Propose definitions of directionally invariant scalarmaps from DTI. Segmentation is
performed with levelsets
Propose region-based levelsets, using a multivariate Gaussian to approximate the
density of the components of diffusion tensor for each sub-region of the volume.
Successfully segmented the corpus callosum in DTI 3D data.
Iterative Clustering on B0 from DTI
Propose a 5-dimensional representation of diffusion spectrum imaging (DSI) data
(location in 3D + two angles for the principal direction description). In (Jonasson
et al., 2007), the levelset approach is used to segment this 5D representation.
As features, they propose an specific scheme of combinations of ADC, FA, radial
anisotropy (RA), volume ratio (VR), and eigenvalues. The resulting segmentation
based on mixture model of multivariate Normal distributions (M3N) and MRF are
combined using simultaneous truth and performance level estimation (STAPLE).
Validation: Overlap measurement and volume agreement betweeen T1 segmentation
(using standard software) and DTI segmentation (proposed method) results on 10
subjects.
Use a T1 co-registered to invariant maps obtained from DTI. The vectorized features
(T1, tensor-norm and FA) are then segmented with a non-parametric model that
maximizes the mutual information between the tissue multivariate distributions and
regularized with MRF.
Perform hierarchical clustering directly over DTI data. After that, a M3N models the

Use the three eigenvalue maps (λ1 , λ2 , λ3 ), the ADC and the FA from DTI data to
estimate the tissue fractions at each voxel. Later, in (Kumazawa et al., 2013) they
refine the estimation applying the multiple tensor model (Tuch et al., 2002).

Structural information co-registration

The last task addressed in the image processing pipeline of the connectivity analysis is the structural
information co-registration. Co-registration or registration is a processing tool to look for a geometrical transformation that maps the information contained in two different coordinate systems (one
corresponding to each image). Image registration is a very broad sub-field in image processing (Zitova
and Flusser, 2003).
Nearly all the procedures surveyed in figure 2.5 can be performed only within the dMRI coordinate
system. However, it is greatly unpractical to perform cortical parcellation directly on the diffusion
space. Cortical parcellation is the process that defines the areas in the WM/GM interface that will
represent the nodes in the graph and that will be used to integrate clusters of streamlines into edges
of the network. Even though some methodologies have been proposed to perform this task clustering
the streamlines (Zimmerman-Moreno et al., 2008), the most extended and accepted procedure to
accomplish the cortical parcellation in dMRI space is mapping it from a high-resolution T1-weighted
atlas (as FreeSurfer package does (Fischl, 2012)).
Notwithstanding the need of a very high-resolution parcellation, registration of structural data into
dMRI space was deeply studied before, with the aim at correcting diffusion images for susceptibility
distortion as introduced in subsection 2.4.1. Susceptibility distortion hinders a straightforward rigidtransform solution to the problem. Additionally, when applying non-linear intensity-based registration
algorithms, other difficulties have to be addressed as the significant PVE in the WM-GM layer, or
the inherent inadequacy of the B0 contrast due to the almost null difference of intensity between WM

16

CHAPTER 2. BACKGROUND AND STATE OF THE ART

and GM pixels. It must be recalled that the B0 is the only useful volume for direct registration, for
being directionally independent.
Early registration methods appeared targeting the distortion correction. They quickly standardized
the choice of T2 as anatomically correct source to be registered against the B0 in dMRI. This is
justified by the fact that B0 images have a very similar contrast to T2 weighted due to the parallelism
of acquisition sequences (see figure 2.2). As parcellation is defined in T1 weighted space, the use of an
additional registration step (T2 to T1 ) is generally overlooked by existing literature in tractography
and connectivity mapping. Even though this processing stage has a relatively low complexity compared
to the remaining elements of the processing pipeline, (Saad et al., 2009) reported that standard
registration techniques as correlation ratio (CR) or mutual information (MI) can account up to 3 mm
of error when registering B0 and T1. With the complexity held in the brain, which cortex sheet is
from 1 mm to 5 mm thick, that range of error is rather significant.
One of the first proposals is (Kybic et al., 2000), where the deformation field is modeled with
B-Splines, the cost function is least squares and optimized in a multi-resolution gradient descent
strategy. Their method is evaluated in both synthetic and real 2D images. Similarly, (Studholme
et al., 2000) proposed a spline-based deformation but including a weighting factor proportional to the
Jacobian of the transform to correct the intensity of the undistorted data. They also use the log of the
signal to enhance the low-signal regions, and optimize with a gradient descent algorithm the mutual
information of the mapping. This framework set the basis for the following works. For instance, (Wu
et al., 2008) also proposed a B-Spline registration providing quantitative comparisons with fieldmap
correction methods. Recent approaches take into account the signal loss due to dephasing (Li et al.,
2007), or introduce more complex variational frameworks (Tao et al., 2009).
In 2009 the research line of registering T2 and B0 seems to get swapped by direct T1 and B0
techniques. This new approach avoids solving the EPI distortions, focusing on the cortical parcellation problem itself. (Saad et al., 2009) proposed a new registration metric (local Pearson’s correlation
(LPC)) that improved results with respect traditional cost functions (as MI and CR). Almost simultaneously, (Greve and Fischl, 2009) proposed the boundary-based registration (BBR) method included
within the FreeSurfer package as bbregister. BBR seeks for a linear transformation of the contours
extracted from the anatomical reference (T1) to the edges detected on the B0 target image. The regions that are likely to suffer from susceptibility distortions are dismissed in the registration process.
Although this registration method does not correct for distortions, it is an outstanding methodology
for direct T1 to B0 registration.
The significant benefits of exploiting the anatomical MRI when segmenting the dMRI data have
been shown by Zöllei et al. (2010), justifying the use of the contours prior information. To our knowledge, there is no study simultaneously taking advantage from segmentation or distortion correction
tasks to be applied to the co-registration problem.

Methodological background

In this section, we review the existing methods that can be applied to solve the open challenges
described in section 2.4, restricting the survey for those methodologies that apply to the objectives
presented latter in Chapter 3. First, in subsection 2.5.1, the widely-used Bayesian framework for
image segmentation will be briefly described, as it can be easily applied to the problem at hand.
Second, in subsection 2.5.2, the so-called active deformation fields (ADFs) model will be presented for
its flexibility to implement joint segmentation and registration solutions. In section 3.2, the aptness
of these simultaneous approaches is justified, and the corresponding contributions expected from this
PhD Thesis are described.

2.5.1

Bayesian inference in image segmentation

Mixture models allow to express relatively complex marginal distributions over observed variables in
terms of more tractable joint distributions over the expanded space of observed and latent variables
(Bishop, 2006). This latent variables behave as simpler components used for building the inferred
observed distribution. This general statistical framework provides not only the possibility of modeling
complex distributions (e.g. figure 2.7), but also enables data to be clustered. Given the generation
and reconstruction processes involved in brain MRI, it is accepted that these latent variables (the
tissue classes) are reasonably well modeled with normal Gaussian distributions (Van Leemput et al.,
1999b).
The most relevant pitfall when modeling the target distribution is the existence of a spatially
smooth offset field (named bias field ). Most imaging datasets are affected by this artifact, and it
critically influences the success of the presented statistical frameworks in a negative manner. In MRI,
this bias is produced by the spatial inhomogeneity of the magnetic field during the scan, an effect
inherent to the acquisition process. Some techniques for tackling the bias field have been proposed,
either embedded within the model (Van Leemput et al., 1999a) or as an independent process (Tustison
et al., 2010). Albeit, this artifact is not present in dMRI datasets.
In order to produce piecewise smooth results, that are more representative of the real latent variables, the mixture models are usually completed by including spatial information. This spatial prior
knowledge is often modeled by Markov Random Field (MRF).
In this section, the mixture model of multivariate Normal distributions (M3N) is introduced, with
special focus on the multivariate formulation. A bias correction methodology is proposed, and finally
the MRF framework is briefly described.
The mixture model of multivariate Normal distributions (M3N) In the image, we index
the location of data on a discrete grid of voxels with i ∈ S = {1, 2, . . . , N }, where S is the image
domain. Denoting the observed data vector of C features (one per image channel ) at index i by
yi = (yi1 , yi2 , ..., yic , ..., yiC ) ∈ RC , then Y = {y1 , y2 , . . . , yN } is the observed random vector field,
and y is a realisation of Y .
The classification process aims to cluster the data S into one of the hidden underlying random fields
X = {x1 , x2 , . . . , xN }, where each sample xi could be assigned any of the latent variables represented
by label values, xi ∈ L = {l1 , l2 , . . . , lK }, K being the total number of classes, and L the set of
available labels. We denote as x a possible configuration of X, that is any specific solution, optimal or
not, to the hard segmentation of S. The hard segmentation of the image is also referred as labeling. L
contains three labels representing the CSF, GM and WM clusterings in the 3-class brain segmentation
problem.
Consequently, the observed distribution will be represented as a linear combination of C-dimensional
Normal distributions. In the simplest approach, that is one Normal distribution per each possible value
lk of the latent variable, what yields:
P (yi | xi ) = N (yi | θk ) = p

Equation (2.1) represents the probability density function of the observed intensity yi for the pure
tissue class x ∈ L, with parameters θk = {µk , Σk }, where µk is the vector of means, Σk is the
covariance matrix and k ∈ {1, 2, . . . , K}. Now, it is possible to combine these K components linearly
in every pixel:

noise 5%, inhomogeneity field 0%). The iso-contours of the resulting mixture of three pure-tissues
are overlaid with white lines. WM and GM are precisely fitted with the model. Conversely, the CSF
distribution is not so well modeled because it is strongly affected by PVE effect (see section 2.5.1). We
only depict here the location and shape of its principal Normal distribution. CSF was modeled in this
example with an extra PVE class, not represented here for better clarity. Additionally, the existence
of other minor sources of tissue contrast and the non-normality of tissues under some conditions is
widely accepted (Van Leemput et al., 1999b).

∀k

In (2.2), P (xi ) is the prior probability of the tissue class xi . For simplicity of notation,
P we substitute
P (xi ) = πk,i , usually coined as proportion factor. This factor meets the condition ∀k πk,i = 1.0.
Initially, for the simplest formulation of M3N, πk,i will be independent of the pixel position. More
sophisticated priors will be presented in section 2.5.1 . For instance, when using atlases as prior
knowledge, this proportion factor introduces the probability maps into the formulation.
Let us formulate the clustering problem as a whole. Assuming that all the possible configurations of
the observed random vector field Y are identically and independently distributed (i.i.d.), the posterior
probability density function of the whole image is
P (y) = P (y | x) P (x) =

N

P (yi ).

(2.3)

i=1

The transition probability, P (y | x), models the feature vector formation process for each tissue
xi . Thus, the problem of segmentation is solved by the estimated labeling x̃, which maximizes the
posterior probability:

x̃ = argmax {P (y | x) P (x)} .

(2.4)

x

Finally, we advance a useful definition for further sections. The conditional probability of xi given
yi represents the rate at which the component xi = lk contributes to model the observation yi . It is
usually referred to as the posterior density or responsibility of class lk within the voxel i:
πk,i N (yi | θk )
.
j∈K πj,i N (yi | θj )

γk,i = P (xi = lk | yi ) = P

(2.5)

Bias field model We define the field inhomogeneity measurement vector at index i by fi =
(fi1 , fi2 , ..., fic , ..., fiC ) ∈ RC with C being the dimension of the feature space (the total number
of image channels). Consequently, F = {f1 , f2 , . . . , fN } is the estimated bias vector field. We follow
the widely accepted assumption of F as a multiplicative smooth function of the pixel position (Vovk
et al., 2007). Thus, the inhomogeneity field modifies our parametric model as follows:
P (yi | xi , fi ) = N (yi fi T | θk ).

(2.6)

If observed variables yi are logarithm transformed, F becomes an additive field. Using the notation
ŷi = log yi , a measurement of the error is obtained:
X
êi = ŷi − log
γk,i µk .
(2.7)
k∈K

In section 2.5.1, we shall discuss how to introduce the minimization of êi , and hence the estimation
of fi into the optimization routine.
PVE modeling Besides the bias field inhomogeneity, another important challenge associated with
tomographic biomedical imaging is the PVE effect. Given that the images are defined on a grid of
volume elements (voxels), they enclose a finite region. This region may contain a mixture of signals
from several different tissues. The amount of voxels affected by the PVE effect within a typical MRI
volume is usually significant, and worse when the resolution is poor (Bromiley and Thacker, 2008).
Rather than complex intensity distribution models or distribution mixtures per class (Santago
and Gage, 1995), PVE can be taken into account using extra classes added to the M3N distribution
(Cuadra et al., 2005). As we shall see in section 2.5.1, appropriate spatial priors can be set for these
PVE classes. In the end of the process, it is possible to merge this extra PVE classes to obtain the
pure tissue distribution maps.
The hidden Markov Random Field (MRF) model The spatial priors model is induced throughout the proportion factors πk,i , considering that the proportion of the tissue k at a given location i
varies depending on the tissues found at the neighbouring locations. MRF theory models these spatial
interactions among tissue classes. The sites in the image domain S are related to a neighbourhood
system N = {Ni , i ∈ S}, where Ni is the set of sites neighbouring i (also called clique), with i ∈
/ Ni
and i ∈ Nj ⇐⇒ j ∈ Ni . A random field x is an MRF on S with respect to N if and only if
P (x) > 0, x ∈ X

(2.8)

πk,i = P (xi | xNi ).

(2.9)

and
Accordingly to the Hammersley-Clifford theorem (Hammersley and Clifford, 1971; Besag, 1974),
an MRF can be equivalently characterized by a Gibbs distribution
P (x) = Z(U )−1 e−U (x|β)

(2.10)

where U (x) is the energy function, β the spatial parameter and Z(U ) a normalization factor. The
choice of the energy function is arbitrary and there are several definitions of U (x) for image segmentation. A general expression of the energy function for pairwise interactions is denoted by

20

CHAPTER 2. BACKGROUND AND STATE OF THE ART

where Vi (xi ) is an external field that weights the relative importance of the different classes present in
the image and Vij (xi , xj ) models the interactions between neighbours. Generally, Vi (xi ) = 0 is set in
order to use a simplified model, or Vi (xi ) is an energy function derived from (2.1). The presented tool
provides a handle to include more energy terms in this pixel-wise energy term. A typical definition of
Vij (xi , xj ) follows the Pott’s model (Zhang et al., 2001):
(
1, if xi = xj
Vij (xi , xj ) = δ(xi , xj ) =
(2.12)
0, otherwise.
Nonetheless, the definition of Vij (xi , xj ) enables more complex neighbouring cliques, distance varying energies, and non-metric tissue transition models (we will discuss these modelsPin section 2.5.1).
Finally, even though Z is theoretically defined, it is implicitly computed by letting ∀k∈K πk,i = 1.0.
λN is usually determined empirically, by sampling a distance function on its value.
For the treatment of the special PVE classes within the model certain values of the transition
model can be set, letting the PVE classes have less energetic transitions to a different class than the
pure tissues.
Model Estimation: EM algorithm In order to find the maximum a posteriori (MAP) introduced
in (2.4), a common solution is the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm. A complete flowchart
describing the optimization strategies is found in figure 2.8. Hereafter, we describe a modified version
adapted to the M3N-MRF model:
(t=0)

Initialization Step Choose the best initialization for θk
. One common option is the use of the
k-means algorithm. Explicit initialization introducing µk and Σk manually, or estimating them
from atlases are also extended options.
(t)

Expectation Step Compute the posterior densities γk,i (see (2.5)).
Bias correction When bias correction is required, the new definition of likelihood derived from (2.6)
is applied. The bias field F can be estimated regressing the error measurement E obtained after
(2.7) with uniform B-splines. This parametric approach is dual to the non-parametric algorithm
(N4ITK) presented in Tustison et al. (2010). For the subsequent step, the data is corrected with
the field vector fi at i before the distribution parameters are calculated.
Maximization Step Updates the parameters of the model. For details on this step, we refer the
reader to (Bishop, 2006). Setting the derivatives with respect to µk and Σk equal to zero in
log (P (yi | xi )) to compute the MAP (2.4), yields the following update equations:

Model Estimation: Graph-Cuts optimization As depicted in figure 2.8, the solution for the
MRF problem posed in (2.11) remains outside the EM algorithm, which only approximates the solution
of (2.4). The standard procedure is to approximate the solution closely with the EM algorithm and
then impose the MRF implicit regularization of smoothness.
Alternatively to the majority of available software (see Table 2.5), we shall propose using graphcuts (graph-cuts (GC)) to solve the MRF. To achieve this, the problem is formulated in terms of
energy minimization. With GC, we refer to the min-cut/max-flow algorithms that are standard in
combinatorial optimization. The problem is stated so that we seek the labeling x that minimizes the
energy
E(x) = Esmooth (x) + Edata (x)
(2.15)
where Esmooth measures the extent to which x is not piecewise smooth, while Edata measures the
disagreement between x and the observed data (Boykov et al., 2001), and identifying the elements
of the latest expression in (2.11). GC algorithms approximately minimize the energy E(x) for an

arbitrary finite set of labels L under two fairly general classes of interaction penalty (Vij ), metric and
semi-metric.
Two widely used algorithms for solving (2.15) are α-expansion and αβ-swap proposed by Boykov
et al. (Boykov et al., 2001; Kolmogorov and Zabin, 2004). Both algorithms have been proven to be
highly accurate and efficient approximations of the global minimum for n-cluster classification (Boykov
and Kolmogorov, 2004). In the case of n = 2 this solution is exact, as opposed to greedy algorithms
like the widely used iterative conditional models (ICM). GC algorithms represent the energy function
with a weighted graph where the minimum of the optimized function concurs on the minimum cut
of the graph. The edge weights represent the total possible energy configurations. In graph theory,
a cut is a partition of the vertices of the graph in disjoint subsets. The size of a cut depends on the
number and weights of the edges removed. Therefore, the minimum cut is that not larger than the
size of any other cut. The binary case is extended to n-cluster classification with iterative algorithms
of very large binary moves (a simultaneous change of labels for a significant number of pixels). The
basic underlying concept is to find local minima sequentially at each iteration, based on the allowed
moves.

Given a label α, an α-expansion move is a change of a number of image pixels from any original
label to α. Consequently, given a pair of labels α, β, an αβ-swap is a move where a number of pixels
with label α change to β and a number of pixels previously labeled β change to α. Once the allowed
moves are defined, the description of the αβ-swap is summarized in Algorithm 1. The α-expansion
algorithm consists of a very similar formulation, explicitly described on (Boykov et al., 2001).

22

CHAPTER 2. BACKGROUND AND STATE OF THE ART

MAP registration-segmentation approaches To finish, there have existed some efforts to adapt
the MAP Bayesian framework (Zhang et al., 2001) for the joint registration-segmentation problems.
(Wyatt and Noble, 2003) presented such an scheme, by introducing a transformation in (2.3). To
do so, let T be the transformation defined with a vector field. Considering two images, the fixed or
reference one F and the moving one M , then our observations field is y0 = {F, T(M )} (only two
features in the vector, C = 2) and the Bayes’ rule for estimating the transform yields:
P (y0 ) = P (y0 | x, T) P (x | T) P (T) =

N X
Y
{ N (yi0 | θk , ti ) P (xi | ti ) P (ti )}.
i=1

(2.16)

∀k

When T is rigid (meaning, it allows only for rotations and translations), then the prior probability where the MRF is introduced can be simplified as the neighbors at each pixel can not change
(P (xi | ti ) P (ti ) = P (xi )). That was the case in (Wyatt and Noble, 2003), that only allowed for
rigid registration. (Xiaohua et al., 2004) extended their framework introducing a B-Spline based
free-deformation regularized with MRF. This constraint is introduced with the P (ti ) term in (2.5.1).
These two early cases where presented for 2D images with promising results. However, no further
extensions of their methods have been published to our knowledge. It is important to mention that
(Ashburner and Friston, 2005) use a very similar framework, but in this case to integrate atlas priors
refinement registering them to the observed data during the segmentation process, increasing significantly the robustness of the overall task. Their Unified segmentation, released with the Statistical
Parametric Mapping (SPM) neuroimage processing package, has become a reference software tool for
segmentation.
Available software The brain tissue segmentation problem has been successfully tackled by means
of Bayesian classification techniques (Van Leemput et al., 1999b), with a number of matching evaluation studies (Cuadra et al., 2005; De Boer et al., 2010; Roche et al., 2011). Further refinements or
extensions have been proposed (Zhang et al., 2001; Van Leemput et al., 2003; Ashburner and Friston,
2005; Fischl et al., 2002), to increase the accuracy and robustness of these methods. As a consequence
of the maturity of the application, a number of 3D brain tissue segmentation tools are readily available
and widely used.
In Table 2.5 there is a comparison among representative existing tools, along with a brief summary
of the unique features of each. The tools listed in the table are FMRIB’s Automated Segmentation
Tool (FAST)1 (Zhang et al., 2001), SPM (Ashburner and Friston, 2005), Expectation-Maximization
Segmentation (EMS) (Van Leemput et al., 2003), ATROPOS (Avants et al., 2011), and NiftySeg (Cardoso et al., 2012). SPM is the only one without support for multivariate data, while FAST provides a
multichannel segmentation that differs significantly from the univariate segmentation methodology (as
it is indicated by partial support in Table 2.5). The model estimation is always performed with the EM
algorithm, possibly with some improvements (in the case of EMS it is improved with a robust estimator and partial volume constraints). Thus, this property has been omitted in the table. All these tools
provide a regularization methodology based on MRF model theory. The main differences are found in
the MRF energy minimization problem, ICM being the most used methodology (with the exception
of EMS that implements Monte-Carlo (MC) sampling). Another important feature is the bias correction technique, generally solved by fitting a linear combination of smooth basis functions. FAST and
EMS use polynomial least-squares fitting, ATROPOS integrates the non-parametric algorithm N4ITK
(Tustison et al., 2010), SPM uses the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) with Levenberg-Marquardt
(LM) optimization. Finally, another important feature is the use of atlases in the model parameters
estimation. All the tools provide support to incorporate prior atlas information, but in the cases of
SPM and NiftySeg the priors are used all along the segmentation (indicated by intensive in Table 2.5).
In terms of software availability, all the tools publicly release the source code and are distributed under
open-source licenses. With respect to their installation, a number of them (FAST, SPM and EMS)
are platform-dependent. To note, the Freesurfer tool (Fischl et al., 2002) has been omitted. Even
though this tool provides brain tissue segmentation support, Freesurfer is a set of automated tools for
reconstruction of the brain’s cortical surface from structural MRI data, and overlay of functional MRI
data on to the reconstructed surface 2 . Therefore, the ultimate purpose and processing methods of
Freesurfer are significantly different from those that appear in Table 2.5, as well as its outcome (e.g.
Freesurfer does not provide real tissue probability maps).

differences and identify the position of the proposed software in the field.

2.5.2

Joint segmentation-registration through Active Deformation Fields

Active contours without edges (ACWE) (Chan and Vese, 2001), and level-set based formulations have
been widely applied in image processing, as reviewed in (Suri et al., 2002). We suggest clustering the
current methodologies of template-based segmentation methods into three groups. The first group
typically adds a shape prior term to the energy functional of an evolving active contour (Bresson
et al., 2006; Chan and Zhu, 2005; Chen et al., 2002; Cremers et al., 2006; Gastaud et al., 2004). These
methods generally have an explicit description of the expected relative boundary locations of the object
to be delineated, and some even model the statistical deviations from this average shape. By including
a spatial mapping, it is possible to perform active contours based registration between timesteps in a
time-series or between different images (Bertalmio et al., 2000; Wyatt and Noble, 2003; Paragios, 2003;
Vemuri and Chen, 2003; Yezzi et al., 2003; Unal and Slabaugh, 2005; Le Guyader and Vese, 2011). A
summary of these second set of techniques is performed in (Droske et al., 2009), proposing two different
approaches to applying the Mumford-Shah (Mumford and Shah, 1989) functional in joint registration
and segmentation. Finally, a derivation of the latter group of techniques is composed by atlas-based
segmentation methods (Gorthi et al., 2009, 2011; Pohl et al., 2005, 2006; Wang et al., 2006), where the
prior imposes consistent voxel-based classification of contiguous regions. Comprehensive summaries of
the aforementioned methodologies, with special attention to joint registration-segmentation methods,
are found in (Gorthi et al., 2011; Le Guyader and Vese, 2011). For convenience, a short review of the
state of the art of these techniques is described hereafter.
One of the first joint “morphing”-segmentation approach (as it was not a proper registration
method) was proposed in (Bertalmio et al., 2000). A full registration framework is then presented
by (Yezzi et al., 2001) assuming that the two (2D) images contain a common object to be registered
and segmented. Their goal is to find two closed curves, each capturing the boundary of the object on
both images with the constraint of a mapping function (an affine transform) from one curve to the
other. The similarity criterium was a region-based energy function and the regularization is based
on the mean curvature flow to ensure smoothness. This approach was later extended for non-linear
deformations by (Unal and Slabaugh, 2005; Wang et al., 2006).
Almost simultaneously (Vemuri et al., 2000) proposed a “coupled partial differential equations
(PDEs) approach”, further extended in (Vemuri et al., 2003) for image registration based on level
sets. The first PDE evolves the level sets of the source image along their normals, with an energy
functional defined as the difference between the target and the evolving source image. The second
PDE allows to explicitly retrieve the displacement vector field. In (Vemuri and Chen, 2003), they
combine the level sets segmentation model from (Vese and Chan, 2002) with prior shape information
through global alignment for joint image registration-segmentation.
(Droske and Rumpf, 2004) proposed a shape-matching functional that locally measures defects
using the field of normals of the level sets defined in both images. As the functional was not defined
on the intensity correlation between images, their solution allows for multi-modal registration. The
matching functional is completed with a nonlinear elastic regularization. More recently, in (Droske
et al., 2009), they extended their work to use the Mumford-Shah functional (Mumford and Shah,
1989) in the minimization, combined with registration of the unknown edge sets. They consider the
deformation and the edge sets as separate variables, and they use finite elements.
(Gorthi et al., 2011) generalized the surveyed methodologies, and proposed a method derived from
(Yezzi et al., 2003) and (Vemuri and Chen, 2003). Moreover, they coined as ADFs to the described
family of registration-segmentation methods, in which the evolution of the contours or the level sets
is driven by a dense deformation vector field. One important contribution in (Gorthi et al., 2011)
is the proposal of a novel multiphase function to compute the level sets, allowing for non-binary

24

CHAPTER 2. BACKGROUND AND STATE OF THE ART

segmentation forces in registration. Almost simultaneously, (Le Guyader and Vese, 2011) presented
a segmentation-registration method not based on explicit level sets. In their work, they use the
Mumford-Shah functional to implement the similarity criterion, more similarly to (Droske et al.,
2009). A first novelty is the use of finite differences, what lets Le Guyader and Vese use a regular grid
(i.e. easier solution and extension to 3D). They proposed a similar nonlinear elastic regularization,
but with a different methodology based on auxiliary variable and the augmented Lagrangians method.
As limitations, they only work on 2D image (even though they affirm it is straightforward the 3D
extension) and they only observe binary implicit level sets (e.g. only one object can be segmented at
a time).
Finally, there also exist some quite different approximations, as they are not based on the ADFs
framework. For instance, (Rouchdy et al., 2007) segmented cardiac MRI by template deformation.
Their approach used the gradient vector flow (Xu and Prince, 1998) as segmentation criterion, and a
deformation field is computed by nonlinear elasticity applying the finite element method.
Level sets approaches to joint image registration-segmentation using ACWE Most of the
surveyed frameworks are deduced from the general level set evolution equation introduced by (Osher
and Sethian, 1988):
∂ΦD (x, t)
= ν(ΦD (x, t)) |∇ΦD (x, t)|
(2.17)
∂t
where ν is the velocity of the flow or speed function that contains the local segmentation and contour
regularization constraints, and ΦD : Ω → R is the signed distance function often used to represent
implicitly the active contour by its zero level. An early extension to image registration was proposed
by (Vemuri and Chen, 2003) but replacing ΦD by the intensity function of the image to register,
ΦI : Ω → R (the moving image). (Bertalmio et al., 2000; Vemuri and Chen, 2003) then define the
speed function as ν(ΦI (x, t)) = ΦI (x, t) − ΦT (x, t), where ΦT (x) is the intensity function of the target
image. Finally, (Gorthi et al., 2011) propose a different multiphase label function as level set function
(ΦL ) that improves registration results.
Naming ΦG a generic objective function, a dense deformation field of vectors u : Rn → Rn (typically
n = {2, 3}) is introduced. Then, the conservation of the morphological description is assumed, such
as ΦG (x, t) = ΦG (x + du, t + dt) =⇒ dΦG (x, t) = 0, where dΦG is the total derivative of ΦG . Using
the chain rule, it can be rewritten as the evolution equation of a vector flow:
∂u(x, t)
ΦG
=−
NΦ ,
∂t
|∇ΦG | G

(2.18)

where NΦG is the normal of the level set. Finally, they introduce the general level set evolution
equation into the vector flow to perform the registration task:
∂u(x, t)
= −ν(ΦG (x, t))NΦG .
∂t

(2.19)

Therefore, the position of the level set function ΦG at time t is given by the deformation field u(x, t)
and the initial level set function ΦG (x, 0), yielding:
∂u(x, t)
= −ν(ΦG (x + u(x, t), 0))NΦG .
∂t

(2.20)

The Mumford-Shah functional The reviewed methods are based on the Mumford-Shah functional (Mumford and Shah, 1989) to compute the velocity function ν. The idea of Mumford and
Shah was to combine image denoising and segmentation by a functional that simultaneously seeks a
piecewise smooth approximation l : (Ω ⊂ Rn ) → R of an image I : (Ω ⊂ Rn ) → RC , where Ω is the
image domain, with typically n = {2, 3}, and C the number of image channels in the multivariate case.
Let K be an edge set that separates the non-smooth parts from each other. Then, the segmentation
can be expressed as the minimization of the functional:
Z
Z
2
E(l(x), K) = (l(x) − I(x))2 dx + λ
|∇l(x)| dx + γ |K| ,
(2.21)
Ω

Ω−K

in which, λ ≥ 0 and γ ≥ 0 are constant weighting parameters. The edge set partitions the image into
an a priori unspecified number of disjoint regions Ωk , with Ω = ∪k Ωk , each being approximated by a
smooth function lk : Ωk → R.

2.5. METHODOLOGICAL BACKGROUND

25

Most of the implementations require l to be piecewise constant. This is called the cartoon limit,
and occurs for λ → ∞. In this limiting case, uk are no longer functions, so they collapse to a single
value. Due to the quadratic penalizer, given Ωk , lk becomes the mean of I within Ωk (lk = µk ), what
yields a more common expression for (2.21):
Z
E(l, K) = (I(x) − µk )2 dx + γ0 |K| ,
(2.22)
Ω

where γ0 is simply a rescaled version of γ.
Regularization After introducing the deformation field within (2.22), a regularization term is usually appended to the energy functional, in order to introduce some constraints that correctly define
the ill-posed registration problem. The regularizer, or smoother, depends on the particular properties
required for the displacement vector field, and it is usually related to the physics of the object under
consideration. In this regard, the most common approach to regularize the deformation field is linear
diffusion smoothing (see (Vemuri et al., 2003)). It is applied at the end of each iteration on the current
global deformation field u. Its PDE corresponds to the well-known heat equation:
∂v(x, t)
= ∆v(x, t),
∂t
v(x, t = 0) = u∗ (x),

(2.23)

where u∗ is the solution of (2.20) at x and ∆ is the Laplacian operator. This technique permits not
only to smooth the deformation field, but also to diffuse the contour deformation in a narrow-band
around it. The fastest way to perform this diffusion is by filtering. The filter corresponding to the
heat equation is the Gaussian filter (Gorthi et al., 2011). Another regularization schemes make use of
mean curvature smoothing, normally when the segmentation forces are region-based. Meanwhile, the
linear diffusion smoothing is applied for pixel-based forces.
Finally, it is necessary to mention the work of (Le Guyader and Vese, 2011), in which they introduce
a nonlinear-elasticity-based smoother. As an outcome, this regularizer allows for topology-preserving
large-magnitude deformations.
Shape gradients Less activity can be reported regarding methods that do not make use of explicit
implementation of the level set function. To compute NΦG in (2.20), (or equivalently, the gradientdescent of the data-term in (2.22)) with respect to the underlying deformation field, avoiding the
explicit setting of the level sets, it is possible to use shape gradients Jehan-Besson et al. (2003);
Herbulot et al. (2006).
Let dΩk be the boundary of a partition Ωk of the full image domain, Ω. Further, r(x) is an
“arbitrary” function over the image domain. We now derive the domain integral w.r.t. the contour
evolution parameter t (time):

where ∂dΩ
∂t , NdΩk is the projection of the boundary movement on the unit inward normal. We
recall here that equation (2.24) sets the bridge between the explicit level set formulations surveyed in
section 2.5.2 by updating the distortion along the steepest energy descent:

∂u(x, t)
∂E(u)
=−
,
∂t

what closes the loop with the general expression of the ADFs introduced in (2.20).

Objectives
Chapter 1 introduced the connectome mapping and analysis as promising areas of pure research.
Accordingly, clinical applications of the advances in the field are scarce and they are not outstanding
in comparison with other mature techniques. However, it is indubitable that dMRI connectomics will
be a very apt tool for neuroscience and clinical routine.
This PhD Thesis project proposes a translational research that aims at advancing the computational tools for dMRI connectome mapping to make them useful in the practical applications that
enhance human health and well-being. The fundamental hypothesis underneath the presented research
is that current technical and computational limitations disable the application of such a potential tool
in neuroscience and healthcare. Therefore, this work addresses specific points of the image processing
performed within the connectivity mapping chain (introduced in Chapter 2), in order to improve the
overall accuracy and reliability of connectome extraction from “in-vivo” human dMRI data. The
achievement of these improvements will unlock the applied use of dMRI connectomics.
This long-term goal will be implemented in three specific objectives:
1. Perliminary study of the applicability of existing techniques from other image processing fields:
WM segmentation in the native space of dMRI with Bayesian clustering techniques.
2. Proposal of a new methodology: joint dMRI segmentation and registration with the anatomical
reference to correct for susceptibility distortions, segment WM and impose an atlas-based cortical
parcellation using an ADFs model.
3. Assessment of the translational advance: evaluation of the presented algorithms, with application
to clinical cases and large-scale databases of normal subjects.

3.1

Preliminary study of the applicability of existing techniques from
other image processing fields

A first approximation to the problem will only cover the segmentation task in native dMRI. A description of the problem at hand is given in subsection 2.4.2, along with a brief summary of the
theory of the proposed framework and the overview of its applications to the target field. For the
accomplishment of this objective we identify a number of elementary targets described below.
Understanding data This objective implicitly deals with obtaining the necessary insights and
the required background on dMRI data. Therefore, this preliminary section of the PhD Thesis will
study the properties of these data, in order to seek for the best features to be exploited in further
investigations.
Registration-based segmentation Available non-linear registration methods will be surveyed in
order to obtain a competitive set of registration tools with their set-up to cross compare results on
dMRI data.
Segmentation tool Once the potentials of the available data are identified, the effort will be set
at defining proper methodologies to drive segmentation (and registration for the case of the second
objective). A general purpose segmentation software will be contributed with comprehensive characterization and evaluation studies using publicly available MRI databases (see subsection 5.1.2). We
will refer to this segmentation software as Multivariate Bayesian Image Segmentation tool (MBIS).
27

28

CHAPTER 3. OBJECTIVES

Adapting the tool to the data This target considers the necessary fine tuning of parameters and
other details of MBIS, based on the conclusions drawn from the accomplished tasks and preliminary
works on PVE and CSF contamination correction.
Sub-voxel precision segmentation and variational Bayes This last block of specific subobjectives deals with investigating the expected evolution of the MBIS tool, investigating how to
achieve sub-voxel precision, as well as using refined Bayesian techniques as the variational Bayes
models.

3.2

Proposal of a new methodology

As shown in Chapter 2, the opportunity and challenge still resides in the integration of processing
techniques to improve results. By jointly solving three major challenging tasks of the connectome
extraction (section 2.4), we aim to drastically improve the overall performance and reliability of
connectome extraction pipelines. Rather than increasing the complexity of the solution, this simultaneous technique will overcome the shared pitfalls consistently with the unique underlying information
to simplify the problem and improve overall performance.
We will reformulate the segmentation and registration problem as an inverse problem, where we
seek for an underlying deformation field (the distortion) mapping from the structural space into the
diffusion space, such that the structural contours segment optimally the dMRI data.
Implementation This novel methodology will be implemented with the resources described in
Chapter 5. As a result, we will produce a software package that can be easily evaluated and analyzed.
This contribution will also allow for the reproduction of experiments and its public communication.
Study of strategies to vector field interpolation One key element of the methodology will be
responsible of of interpolate a sparsely-defined deformation field (a vector for each off-grid node of the
surface) to a dense deformation field, defined point-wise over the domain of the images.
Evaluation and application on a digital phantom In order to illustrate the applicability of
our solution, the PhD Thesis will show exemplary experiments to illustrate the performance and
limitations of the proposed techniques, by using the advanced digital phantom further described in
subsection 5.1.1. Under this objective, results will be compared to existing procedures.
Optimization Two optimization approaches will be investigated, namely gradient descent and alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM).

3.3

Assessment of translational advance

With the aim at enclosing all the gathered findings into a consistent work, the PhD Thesis will
end benchmarking the presented advances. Therefore, in this last objective, a group of validation
experiments as well as applications to healthy and clinical cases will be provided. These examples
will demonstrate the usefulness of the advances on real datasets, trying to highlight the improvements
achieved with respect to widely-used procedures.
Comprehensive evaluation in scan-rescan datasets A first evaluation experiment will address
the validation requirements for a high-standard processing tool. This study will be conducted in a pilot
of 5 healthy volunteers subjected to a scan-rescan session. Visual inspection by blinded experts, rating
the accuracy achieved, and quantitative assessment of the repeatability of results will be reported.
Clinical application After validating the tool, one experiment illustrating clinical application will
be conducted. Available data allow for several options. Thus, a preliminary objective in this area is
the selection of the most appropriate framework. In this regard, this PhD project will evaluate three
possible experiments described below, and select the most appropriate to demonstrate the clinical
application of the proposed advances:

3.3. ASSESSMENT OF TRANSLATIONAL ADVANCE

29

1. The human connectome atlas. Once the tool has been proven to improve the overall performance of the connectome extracting pipeline, it will be used to obtain the corresponding
networks of a large-scale database of dMRI datasets. For this objective, a preliminary check
of aptness of the database will be performed as the objective can be impractical in the case
that data is not adequate. Once this requirement is met, a template connectome will be built
through probabilistic inference procedures. As an evaluation result, a comprehensive analysis of
uncertainty of the resulting network will be compared with the corresponding matrix obtained
without the proposed contributions. The expected outcome of this experiment is to prove that
atlas uncertainty is lowered, and hence, the template networks obtained are more accurate.
2. Thalamus segmentation in high-resolution diffusion weighted images. Currently, there
is a high interest on atlas-based segmentation of the Thalamus on dMRI data. That is a
straightforward application of the proposed methods, but some adaptations should be performed
before proceeding with this second application.
3. Application to neurodegenerative diseases Finally, based on the rate of success in advancing the connectomics to the clinic, the PhD Thesis will demonstrate the usefulness of its research
by comparing end-analysis results with and without the proposed methodologies.

Chapter 4

Research plan
A research plan has been developed in order to cover the objectives presented in Chapter 3, and hence
it presents a parallel structure. It is organized in five units called Work Units (WUs). The first unit
contains the preliminary work section 4.1 necessary to set the required standpoint for subsequent tasks
and establish a background on the field. The following units (WUs 1, 2, and 3) address the three
main objectives of this PhD proposal. Finally, the WU-5 contains other aside activities and works in
related projects that benefit the development of this Thesis.

4.1

Work Unit 1: Preliminary work

The tasks grouped in this unit address:
• the accomplishment of the mandatory course work, fulfilling the Master’s degree included in the
PhD Program (reference: DSE RD1393/2007),
• the basic understanding of the dMRI images (section 2.2) and related modalities (such as those
additional MRI data used in susceptibility distortion correction),
• the study of the open challenges in the proposed research line described in section 2.4, and
• the review and analysis of the state of the art methods in order to understand the open challenges.

4.2

Work Unit 2: Bayesian inference

Based on the theory described in subsection 2.5.1, this WU will propose a solution for the first specific
objective of this work (section 3.1). Hence, this unit will address the reliable segmentation of dMRI
data in native space using Bayesian inference techniques.

4.3

Work Unit 3: Active deformation fields

This WU will fulfill the third specific objective of the Thesis (section 3.2). All the tasks below this unit
will address the research of the new methodology based on the ADFs described in subsection 2.5.2.

4.4

Work Unit 4: Evaluation and applications

This last research unit will analyze and carry out the most illustrative applications of the conducted
research. Based on real data described in Chapter 5, the aim of the WU4 is to demonstrate that the
final commitment of translating the resulting methodologies into neuroscience research and potentially
the clinical routine has been successfully satisfied.

4.5

Work Unit 5: Additional activities

Some special events (courses, conferences, etc.) have been held or are scheduled to ensure the PhD
Thesis high standards.

5.1.1

Image Data
Simulated digital phantoms

The lack of a widely accepted gold -standards in the application field has been addressed by several
authors (Côté et al., 2013). With the aim at evaluating the correctness of results and validating the
methodologies proposed, highly realistic simulated digital phantoms will be used. In the context of
the PhD Thesis, three different levels of completeness will be achieved for the proposed phantoms.
Axial slices of the three phantoms are presented in figure 5.1.
“Sulcus” phantom The first basic phantom is aimed at challenging the proposed solutions with the
geometrical complexity of the human brain to demonstrate certain exclusive features of the methodology proposed in section 3.2. This model will simulate an artificial sulcus as proposed in (MacDonald
et al., 2000), with an intensity distribution inspired on the T1 MRI corrupted with certain normally
distributed noise.
DMRI signal simulation (“spheres phantom”) The next level of simulation will comprehend
a combination of spherical shapes mimicking the three main tissues in the brain (CSF, WM, GM).
This model will produce a realistic EPI signal for each tissue. However, at this level of complexity, no
fiber tracts are simulated because the generated signal will have random orientation per voxel.
Advanced phantom Finally, the most complete digital phantom1 that is publicly available will
be adapted to the application at hand. This phantom is a spherical volume containing a set of fiber
bundles, that connect one area of a “cortex” to another. The model accounts for PVE using a similar
approach to (Close et al., 2009).

5.1.2

Real MRI databases

Evaluation dataset For the development of the first and second objectives (section 3.1 and section 3.2), an ad-hoc database is under acquisition. This database comprehends 5 healthy volunteers
with no history of neurological conditions (ages 27±6, 2 female). All the subjects were scanned in a 3T
MR Scanner (Siemens Magnetom TrioTim, Siemens, Erlangen, Germany) with a standard 12-channel
head coil. Subjects were scanned twice with the same protocol, described in Table 5.1. After being
scanned the first time, each subject exited the scan room for a short break and then reentered for
an identical scan session. To note, there was a full repositioning of the volunteer, coils, blankets and
pads before each scan and re-scan session.
Publicly available databases This PhD Thesis proposal observes the utility of two publicly
available databases. The first one is the the Multi-Modal MRI Reproducibility Resource (Kirby21)
database (Landman et al., 2011). Kirby21 consists of scan-rescan imaging sessions on 21 healthy
volunteers without history of neurological disease. The database includes a wide range of imaging
modalities, from which we selected T1, T2, DTI and magnetization transfer MRI (MT). The complete
database is publicly released online 2 .

The second database is the Information eXtraction from Images - EPSRC GR/S21533/02 (IXI)
dataset (Hill et al., 2006), which contains nearly 600 MRI scans of normal and healthy subjects. The
acquisition protocol for each subject includes T1, T2, proton density-weighted MRI (PD)-weighted,
and DTI images and some other modalities which we did not consider in our current study. All
additional information about this database can be found in their website. From this database, we
discarded those subjects for which the age information was not available in the demographic spreadsheet distributed along with the IXI dataset. After that, a total cohort of 585 was selected for the
experiment.
Clinical databases Additional databases will be provided by the Department of Radiology, Universitary Hospital Center of Canton Vaud, Lausanne (CHUV), for the accomplishment of the objective
described in section 3.3 regarding clinical application. Depending on a preliminary analysis of the improvement achieved with the proposed methodology, the most appropriate application will be selected
among the following:
• Epilepsy database: using the same database, the hypothesis of this experiment would confirm
the results of the new methodology as it compares to an existing and conclusive experiment
