What is “young adulthood”?

What is “young adulthood”?
• Must begin by understanding the middle stage, the
transitional period between childhood and full adult
maturation, i.e., adolescence
• Involves 3 types of hormonal transitions for full puberty
– dramatic changes in body size and composition, driven by high
rates of GH secretion
– gonadarche – increased pulsing of gonadotrophin releasing
hormone, pituitary releases LH/FSH, M/F differences
– adrenarche – hormones released by the adrenal glands, DHEA and
DHEAS

What is “young adulthood”?

Dahl, 2004

Jay Giedd, 2011

But in addition….
• interaction of complex behavioral, social, and familial
influences
• Range of scientific disciplines have been focusing on this
period
– Affective neuroscience
– Cognitive neuroscience
– Social neuroscience

• Importance of Brain/behavior/social-context
interactions

The Paradox of this Period…
• Adolescents/YAs are bigger, stronger, increased reaction
times, reasoning abilities, immune function, and able to
withstand heat, cold, & physical stresses, but…
• Overall morbidity/mortality rates increase > 200%
during this period
– Not due to cancer, infectious diseases, etc., but due to ….
– Control of behavior and emotion
• MVAs, suicide, homicide, SUD
• Risk-taking behaviors – STDs,
• Increased risk-taking, sensation-seeking, reckless behaviors

Dahl, 2004

How & Why is this Happening?
• Paradox of better reasoning and cognitive abilities than
children, yet much greater risk
• More prone to erratic, emotionally influenced
behaviors, leading to intermittent disregard for
consequences
• It’s nothing new…
– Aristotle: “Youth are heated by nature as drunken men by
wine
– Shakespeare: “I would that there were no age between 10 and
23, for there’s nothing in between but getting wenches with
child, wronging the ancientry, stealing, fighting…” (The
Winter’s Tale, Act III)

Dahl, 2004

Understanding the Perilous Passage
• Development of behavioral & emotional regulation of
adolescents/YAs
• Views of the problem:
– A period of heightened “storm and stress?” (G.S. Hall)
– “Raging hormones….?” – 1960-70’s
• Youth with higher hormone levels do not have more problems

– 80% of youth succeed thru the transition without major
difficulties
• success in school, good relations with parents & peers, no SUD,
successful vocational transitions
• Yet adolescence is where roots for nicotine, alcohol, addictions,
behavioral, emotional, and other long-standing problems take root

The Answer?
• Not simple puberty or its related bodily maturational
processes…
• Rather, the developing interplay of cognitive, social, and
emotional skills and behaviors within adult life contexts
• How do societal roles/responsibilities and these individual
maturational changes interact?

186 traditional/ancient societies (Schliegel & Barry, 1991)
Most have an “adolescent period”
End of childhood demarcated by rituals
Adulthood defined by adult roles (marriage, work roles, hunting,
owning property, etc.)
– Period from puberty to adult status usually brief, 2-4 years

Dahl, 2004

Tanner, 1989

Differences: Traditional vs. Current Societies
Dahl, 2004

• Average age of menarche in US is age 12
• Increasingly longer age to marriage
– 1970: 21 & 23, females/males
– 2000: 26 & 27, females/males

• Current age to “adult” status: 8-15+ years
– Marriage
– Home ownership
– College/grad school

• Advantages of longer transitional period
– Increased education and skills
– Exploration of different roles and relationships

• Disadvantages?

The Challenge for Us (and our Youth)
• Cognitive and emotional development
– Many aspects of cognitive development, i.e., “cool” logic
are intact, near-adult status, and “online” by midadolescence
– Other aspects of affective (emotional development)
development and regulation are at increased levels (see
Table 1)
– Starting the engines with an unskilled driver on a
course that is much more complex than in traditional
societies (Dahl, 2004)
– A time of “ignited passions” – sports, hobbies, idealistic
causes, etc. (Dahl, 2004

The Challenge for Us (and our Youth)

Dahl, 2004

The Challenge for Us (and our Youth): II
• Adulthood requires developing self-control over behavior
and emotions to appropriately inhibit and modify
behaviors
– Pursuit of long-term goals with many intermediate steps
– Navigation of complex social situations despite
competing emotions
• Requires not just brain and pubertal maturation, but time
and experience within increasingly complex environments

At What Age are We “Mature”?
• Driving at age 16, military service at 18, drink alcohol at
21, rent a car at 25….
• Yet in some states, stand trial for murder at age 12 or 13?
• At what age should someone be able to make potentially
self-destructive choices about health risks?

Having (or refusing) an operation
Abortion
Quitting school
Body piercing
Join the military, get married, etc.?

Considerations for Parenting,
Practice and Policy

Considerations for Parenting,
Practice and Policy
• Length of the period of parental support and
guidance?
• Scaffolds of societal support
– College and vocational supports
– Erikson’s “moratorium”

Considerations for Parenting,
Practice and Policy
• Channeling of passions into constructive activities
& programs
– Ideas and ideals
– Beauty, music, & art
– Causes and programs
– Social contexts & supports

Considerations for Parenting,
Practice and Policy
• Better Identification of the 20% of Youth at Risk
– Early substance use
• Protecting developing brains

– Depression & related conditions
– Mainstreaming “mental health” into health
• Stigma reduction

– “ACE’s”
– “Action Signs”

Where We Might Do Better: Example #1
ADHD
• Some “overdiagnosis” of ADHD, but ½ of ADHD cases still
missed in PC, special ed settings (Bauermeister et al., 2002, Bussing et al., 1998,
Olfson et al., 2003, Jensen et al., 1999, 2004)

• Only one-fourth to one-half of PCPs use DSM criteria, and
many do not get data from school teachers (Copeland, 1987; Wolraich et
al., 1990, 1997; Moser, 1995; Sloan et al., 1998)

• Inadequate recognition of comorbid problems (Jensen et al., 1989)
• Inadequate dosing (MTA Cooperative Group, 1999a, 1999b)
• Inadequate follow-up (twice-yearly visits) (MTA Cooperative Group,
1999a, 1999b)

• Only 1/2 of PCPs include any kind of therapy (Hoagwood et al., 1998)

Where We Might Do Better: Example #2:
Major Depressive Disorder (MDD)
• High rates of MDD in PCP settings (up to 28%)
• 4 of 5 Youth with MDD missed in PCP settings (Chang et al.,
1988, Kramer & Garralda, 1998)
• Most PCPs think it is their responsibility to identify
depression (Olson et al., 2001, Jensen, 2002)
• Most PCPs “intend” to screen for depression and suicide,
but do it less often than other areas (sexual activity/birth
control), only 15% and 17% do it always (Halpern-Felsher et al, 2000;
Middleman et al., 1995)

Where We Might Do Better:
Earlier/Improved Identification
• 3 in 4 youth with MH problems missed in PCP settings (Costello,
1986, 1988; Dulcan et al., 1990; Chang et al., 1988, Kramer & Garralda, 1998)

• SGO, USPTF, pediatric leaders, consensus panels, and
President’s New Freedom Commission acknowledge need to
encourage MH screening and earlier of youth in PC-,
school-, foster care-, and JJ-settings: “mental health checkups”
• Brief screening tools can increase rates of identification (Horwitz
et al., 1992; Jellinek et al., 1999, Murphy et al., 1996)

How We Might Do Better:
Early Identification Strategies
• Valid tools have been deployed locally and nationally, and
are feasible in PC, EPSDT, and Medicaid settings (Jellinek
et al., 1999; Murphy et al., 1996; Pagano et al., 1996)
• Psychosocial Functioning/Impairment Screens
– Child/youth report: Safe Times Questionnaire, Youth
Outcomes Questionnaire; Problem-oriented Screening
Instrument for Teens (POSIT), GAPS
– Clinician-administered: CAFAS, CGAS

Recommendations
• Policy initiatives
– Expland E-B programs
– Investment in quality TA to providers
• Accurate information
– Culturally specific, community-adapted and implemented, re:
role and value of MH screening, “warning signs,” treatments
• Training/retraining
– Federal, professional, and advocacy coalition for E-B curricula
in training programs (PhD, MA, MSW, MD)
– Teacher and counselor curricula-certification (understanding
and attitudes re: youth disorders)
