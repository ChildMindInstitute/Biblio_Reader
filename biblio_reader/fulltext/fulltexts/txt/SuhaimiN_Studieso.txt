ABSTRACT
Brain as main server for entire human body is a complex composition. It is a challenging task to read and interpret
the brain. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has become one of the means to do the task. fMRI is a noninvasive technique to measure brain activity of a human subject according to various stimuli. However, the fMRI datasets
for each subject is huge and high-dimensional. For instance, the dataset has four dimensions for 3D images time series.
Pre-processing and analysing using pattern recognition are insignificance for datasets with varied anatomical structures and
dimensions. On the other hand, supervised learning or biomarker is employed to reduce the curse-of-dimensionality of
fMRI datasets. Yet, the process is difficult and subjective to the labeled datasets. Therefore, a well-versed approach in
signal processing, natural language processing (NLP) and object recognition, known as deep learning is seen to have higher
standard than usual classification approach. Deep learning is the improved version of neural network with higher capability
and accuracy. This paper aims to review the deep learning approach in fMRI classifications based on three studies on fMRI
data classifications.
Keywords: fMRI, deep learning, classification and neural network.

INTRODUCTION
The brain is a complex composition. It is the
main server for entire system of body. Thus, reading and
interpreting what is inside the brain becomes a very
challenging task. However, studying the brain has proved
to be beneficial for disease prevention and detection,
psychological treatment and behavioral understanding [14].
The functional magnetic resonance imaging
abbreviated as fMRI is a non-invasive technique to
measure brain activity [5]. It is routinely used to localize
various brain states according to various stimuli such as
finger tapping, image recognitions and reading. Countless
investigations had been done to localize neural actions
such as blood percentage in the neurons correlates to
various stimuli as mentioned. On the other hand, the
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is more to mapping
the brain structure while fMRI is brain function mapping.
Specifically, fMRI measures haemodynamic
changes which is the changes of blood flow. The
measurement is known as blood-oxygen-level dependent
(BOLD) due to haemodynamic response. It is detected by
fMRI scanner that intrinsically has low signal to noise
ratio (SNR) output. This is due to various activities
influence including the main stimuli. For instance, while
recognizing faces in images as main stimuli, brain would
also process colors and shapes in the images. Thus, many
brain activities will be detected by the BOLD
measurement. In addition to low SNR, low temporal
resolution of fMRI as compared to EEG requires good
design of experiment. On the important note, fMRI is
recorded by slices of brain map. Thus, large size of dataset
is recorded for an individual subject such as three
orientations (axial, sagittal and coronal) [6].
Recently, for analyzing the datasets of fMRI,
classification technique has become the main approach

[7]. The technique is one of the machine learning
components. This technique can be used to extract
exciting new information from neuroimaging data,
especially the fMRI datasets. In words, classification is the
analogue of regression when the variable being predicted
is discrete, rather than continuous. For instance, man and
woman classification, Alzheimer’s patient or control
patient classification and moving and reading activity
classification. With multiple subjects, classification
technique is expected to give higher and more accurate
result.
The fMRI dataset is very huge for each of
individual subject. Three orientations and countable slices
of brain images resulted in big data. Whole brain preprocessing would incur difficulties and harder to be
analyzed compared to normal data capacity. Not only that,
data acquisition is crucial process, as different orientation
would produce dissimilar dimension for different subjects.
This is due to anatomical structure of every subject’s
brain. In addition, acquired data shown a lot of variation
for different subjects although with similar stimuli or
activity. The huge data and dissimilar orientations of the
brain incur problems in data classification.
One of dominant approaches in brain imaging
ismulti- voxel pattern analysis (MVPA) approach.This
approach must be preceded by feature selection. It is
difficult and subjective process for big data
classification[8]. Supervised learning is seen to be one of
the problem in fMRI analysis as researcher has to identify
the correct input and output beforehand. Furthermore, the
parameter optimization step might reduce the accuracy of
the approach.
In this study, we propose to review the previous
researches on classification of fMRI datasets using various
types of deep learning. The methods are studied to give
particular ideas for practical usage and improvements.

CONVENTIONAL METHODS
Brain mapping is the association of perceptual or
cognitive states with specific patterns of brain activity and
it is central to human neuroscience [9].There are single
subject, multi subjects, single stimulus and multi stimulus
approaches in brain mapping.Conventional brain mapping
is univariate that treat each voxel as an independent
measurement. General linear model (GLM) is one of
conventional methods that utilizesparametric statistical
analysis. The analysis aims tocategorize brain regions that
demonstrate significant signal changes in response to the
experimental conditions [10].The GLM is a massive
univariate testing, i.e. one statistic per voxel. The method
introduces multiple comparison for same test that
relatively increases the processing time.
Other conventional technique is event-related
fMRI responses[11]. This technique measures the
temporal brain response on related event or stimulus.It
introduces experimental design to relate the timing of
events to the acquisition of data. As a result, a temporal
resolution is acquired. The temporal resolution is
important in that approach for dimension reduction step.
CURRENT DEVELOPMENTS
Later on, researchers are using many stimuli
approach for an individual subject. The term that is
normally used is multivariate and interchangeably with
multi-voxel. The stimuli can be distinct or similar to each
other. For instance, hand tapping and speaking is distinct
to each other, but both activities need muscle movements.
Thus, brain mapping classification is essential and
introduced in this field.
One that is particularly famous and widely used
method for brain mapping classification is MVPA. It
employs simple classifier such as linear regression
method. And many other researchers are using pattern
analysis for mapping the brain, human’s or animal’s [1214]. However, high inter-subject variability in brain
function becomes a big challenge for researchers.
Furthermore, the problem lies in choosing the best
classifier.
Later, new approach to encounter the intersubject variability by supervised learning and
classification is tackled. Under the same multi-voxel
pattern analysis method, the new approach is to train by
feeding samples of input-output pairs. Thus, when tested,
the characteristics consistency existence could be
classified and labeled. However, varied orientations and
dimensions incur another problem, due to difficult
acquisition of input-output samples.
There are wide range of developed classifications
algorithm. Varied performance has given a platform for
practical testing and improvement. Naive Bayes is one of
outstanding and robust classifier. With the probability as
backbone, the discrete identification is adapted to the
Naive Bayes. However, it is only applicable for linear
problem. The fMRI datasets are susceptible for nonlinearity classification.

Currently developing algorithm, support vector
machine (SVM) constructs a separating hyperplane such
that the distance from the hyperplane to the nearest data
point is maximized [15]. This method adopts Naive Bayes
approach with some alteration for non-linearity data
adaption [16]. In early development, only two-class is
expected to be classified by conventional SVM.
However, there are many approaches for
improvement of SVM technique to suite multi-class
classification. The primary approach is by multiplying
binary classification to be multi-class. All in all, this
classification does not cater high dimensionality datasets
of fMRI. Dimensionality reduction is introduced but
suffers generalization in fMRI classification. Figure-1
shows the general idea of current approach development.
DEEP LEARNING
To address the high dimensional and nonlinearity of fMRI datasets, deep learning approach is
introduced. Deep learning is a branch of machine learning.
It is a wider and longer hidden layers of neural network
(NN). In contrast to ANN, deep learning uses low-level
abstraction and gradually increases to higher level until the
feature is classified.

Figure-1. Current development approach such as Naive
Bayes and SVM. The dataset is divided for training and
testing data. Then, features extraction is done on the
training data. Next, the feature is fed back to training set
when not selected. While; if features selection is
completed, chosen classification approach is employed,
such as Naive Bayes or SVM. Later, the performance is
evaluated.
For instance, the first low-level abstraction are all
the pixels available in the images. And the next abstraction
would be edges. Further down local shapes would be next
abstraction in images. However, in practice, the right level
is unknown due to automated discovery of abstraction
[17]. It has adopted unsupervised learning architecture.
This is because; the approach is free of input-output
samples. Many researches are tweaking the initialization
and architecture of deep learning. Figure-2 shows the
simple explanation of deep learning for image recognition.

Common deep learning network architectures
include deep belief network (DBN) [19], autoencoders
[20], and convolutional neural network (ConvNet) [21].
DBN consists of restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM). It
is a Markov random field that models data distribution and
parameterizing it with the Gibbs distribution. While autoencoder seems easier to train rather than RBM, as each
level can be trained separately. DBN and autoencoder
adopt bi-directional neural network architecture. On the
other hand, ConvNet as introduced in [22] is feed-forward
deep neural network that can be trained purely supervised.

binomial probabilities. The � . is the decoder of the
algorithm while � � � is the reconstruction produced by
the network.
In adaptation to fMRI data, each visible variable
data represents a voxel in fMRI with a real-valued and
approximate of Gaussian distribution [8].This coding and
encoding is one of the main approaches in many other
areas including neuroscience. Research in this area of
imaging attempts to make better representations with the
foundation of neural netwoks and computational
capabilities nowadays. Furthermore, many attempting to
create models that learn these representations from largescale unlabeled data.
CASE STUDIES DISCUSSION
Case study 1: Classification on ADHD using deep
learning [23]
ADHD is attention deficit hyperactivity disorder
which is one of the common mental disorder among
children. Poor concentration and excessive activity are
among the main symptoms of children with ADHD.
Development in neuroscience has helped research in
mental disorder department. For ADHD, there exist
abnormality in fMRI compared to the healthy. This
research has employed deep learning to classify the four
distinct subjects; control, combined, inattentive and
hyperactive.
Authors employed three important steps;
preprocessing, dimension reduction and deep belief
network (DBN) classification approach on the datasets.
The fundamental step when dealing with fMRI datasets is
preprocessing where the main processes are alignment,
slice-time correction, normalization, and spatial
smoothing. Later on, the authors applied brodmann
template to reduce the dimension and convert the data to
frequency domain. The max-pooling frequencies is done
in assumption that active voxel has higher frequency. The
DBN with three hidden layers is chosen for training and
testing the frequency domain-datasets. Every two training

neighboring layers is used for backpropagation for tuning
the model.

Figure-4. fMRI datasets preprocessing using Statistical
parametric mapping software (SPM8) [24].
This classification technique of deep learning
approach uses ADHD-200 datasets for three categories.
The authors claim to have higher accuracy of 2.2% as
compared to ADHD-200 researchers. However, it is
observed that the higher dataset category has higher
accuracy compared to less datasets. The hypothesis is; the
more data trained the higher accuracy and effectiveness of
deep learning approach.
Case study 2: Memory encoding and decoding with
deep learning [25]
The study aims to obtain fMRI modelling using
unsupervised learning representation for memory
encoding and decoding based on ten semantic categories.
Small subset of measurements, which is 100 and 1024
voxels, are studied. Dimensions of the feature and
accuracy of the method become the benchmark for this
study.
The method includes autoencoder, one type of
deep learning architecture that stacked together
andexpected to be more efficient compared to MVPA
technique. As one of the neural network type, the
autoencoder targets to learn two model parameters,
Θ = {� , � } and two non-linear consecutive feature
mapping functions. The functions are used to classify the
tasks or feed the input layer to another autoencoder.
Authors applied gradient descent to optimize the model
parameters.
Results shown that the method known as nonlinear feature mapping (NLFM) has higher accuracy when
more hidden layers and numbers of voxels employed.
Though the baseline MVPA technique has the same
accuracy for single hidden layer of NLFM, the feature
dimensions are lower than MVPA. In addition, this type of
deep learning method gives higher accuracy when higher
voxels are used that conveniently proves the previous
hypothesis.
Case study 3: Brain parcellation using deep learning
[26]
Brain parcellation is the approach of defining the
brain based on its functional connectivity. The gap in this
area is the lack of standard model protocol due to
assumption of similarity in subjects’ anatomy. The author
aims to develop the ideal protocol of brain parcellation
using deep learning. The approach benefited the stacked
autoencoder type of deep learning architecture.

Author mentioned the need to pre-training each
layer to reduce computation cost despite the conventional
approach of deep learning where random initialization is
employed. Similar to [25], author used Limited memory
BFGS (L-BFGS) optimization algorithm to optimize the
parameters. Accordingly, fine-tuning is applied on entire
network to improve the performance of stacked
autoencoder.
Study shown that four hidden layers has
performed better than five hidden layers. Overfitting and
less accuracy might occur for five hidden layers. Though
the achievement of parcellation is less accurate,
nevertheless, the approach enhances the quality of
experimental investigations due to no subjects’ anatomical
dependencies. Thus, the assumption for conservative
protocol is avoided. The author suggested more fMRI
datasets for higher accuracy.
CONCLUSIONS
There are many types of deep learning
architectures. Those reviewed study cases are published in
the same year, which is 2014, despite their different
background and fMRI datasets. These studies are few of
major breakthroughs in fMRI data classification using
deep learning approach.
In spite of that, the stacked autoencoder deep
learning is proposed in the two out of three studies. The
approach is reliable specifically for fMRI datasets due to
very few labelled data in neuroimaging field. Thus, an
unsupervised learning is favored in this field. Those
studies also suggested that more datasets would suggest
better classifications and accuracy. Thus far, deep learning
approach is developing in many ways and promise more in
the future.
