Abstract
Anxiety is one of the most common clinical problems among children, adolescents, and

cr

adults with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), yet we know little about its etiology in the context

us

of ASD. We posit that emotion regulation (ER) impairments are a risk factor for anxiety in ASD.
Specifically, we propose that one reason why anxiety disorders are so frequently comorbid with

an

ASD is because ER impairments are ubiquitous to ASD, stemming from socio-cognitive,
physiological, and neurological processes related to impaired cognitive control, regulatory

M

processes, and arousal. In this review, we offer a developmental model of how ER impairments

result in anxiety.

EMOTION REGULATION AND ANXIETY IN ASD

Emotion regulation (ER) refers to the ability to modulate experienced and expressed

ip
t

emotion in the service of goal-directed or value-based behavior. For example, becoming

transiently angry when someone takes your parking space may be a normative response, but it is

cr

not adaptive to act on that anger in an aggressive manner. In such situations, optimal ER skills

us

allow for the down-regulation of negative emotions to proceed with the task at hand (i.e., find
another place to park). An impoverished ability to cope with and control intense, especially

an

negative, emotions is associated with a range of psychiatric conditions and symptoms (Aldao,
Nolen-Hoeksema, & Schweizer, 2010; Berking et al., 2012; Berking & Wupperman, 2012), and

M

the goal of this review is to explore ER impairment in relation to manifest anxiety in autism

spectrum disorder (ASD).

te

Over the last several years, there has been burgeoning scientific interest in the possibility
that ER impairments are nearly ubiquitous in ASD (Mazefsky et al., 2013). Impaired ER may
underlie many of the behavior problems commonly seen in children and adults with ASD, such

as aggression, irritability, and anxiety (Mazefsky & White, 2013). Anxiety is among the most
commonly observed and impairing associated (i.e., non-core) symptoms in ASD (e.g., White,
Oswald, Ollendick, & Scahill, 2009). As many as four out of five children with ASD are
diagnosed with comorbid psychiatric disorders (Simonoff et al., 2008) and, although there is
evidence that diagnostic practices that take into account the ASD-related impairments would
result in fewer comorbid diagnoses (Mazefsky, Oswald, Day, Eack, Minshew, & Lainhart,
2012), children, adolescents, and adults with ASD are clearly at increased risk of experiencing a
range of secondary behavioral and emotional problems.

EMOTION REGULATION AND ANXIETY IN ASD

In this review, we consider socio-cognitive, physiological, and neural mechanisms that
may serve as mediators of ER impairments in ASD. We then explore possible pathways between
disrupted ER and the behavioral manifestations of anxiety in ASD, with a focus on intra-

ip
t

individual moderating influences. The goals of this paper are to synthesize the extant literature
related to specific processes involved in ER impairments in ASD and to identify factors that may

cr

cause ER deficits to manifest as anxiety. We conclude with recommendations for future research

us

to systematically evaluate the plasticity of ER mechanisms and thereby reduce anxiety in ASD.
Overview: Emotion Regulation and Anxiety in ASD

an

Anxiety is an emotional response with both affective and physiologic components.
Anxiety can be defined as nervous tension and autonomic arousal, often accompanied by general

M

distress (Clark & Watson, 1991). The regulation of emotion is distinct from the experience of

d

that emotion. For example, a child might cope with anxiety about speaking in front of peers by

te

reminding himself that most other children his age also get anxious or by feigning illness on the
morning of a class presentation. Reappraisal and avoidance behaviors such as these are strategies
to modulate or regulate the emotion responses. Emotional experience is automatic and often

intense, whereas the regulatory strategies used for coping with the situation are often explicit and
intentional.

ER is a broad, multilevel process, involving inter-related systems (e.g., attention,
physiology, neurological processes; e.g., Calkins, 2010). Regulatory strategies are typically used
to increase, or heighten, an emotional experience (up-regulation), decrease the emotion itself, or
dampen the outward expression of the emotion (down-regulation). Derived from Gross’ (2001)
process model of ER, strategies can also be categorized in relation to emotional experience.
Regulation can occur prior to the experience of the emotion or in response to the emotion,

3

termed antecedent-focused and response-focused strategies, respectively. For example,
avoidance of situations likely to trigger an unpleasant emotion is an antecedent strategy whereas
suppression of an emotion is response-focused and occurs after the emotion generating

ip
t

experience. Additionally, some regulatory strategies are explicit and intentional (e.g., reappraisal,
suppression), whereas others are implicit, or occurring without conscious intention (e.g., affect

labeling; Gyurak, Gross, & Etkin, 2011).

A person’s ‘regulatory style’ is associated with general well-being (Gross & John, 2003)
and, in some cases, the development of psychopathology (Ciccetti, Ackerman, & Izard, 1995).

an

Developmentally, regulatory ability improves dramatically during the first few years of life
(Calkins, 2010) and is predictive of positive outcomes. A child’s ability to effectively manage

M

emotions, for example, predicts better adaptive behavior and social relationships (Eisenberg &

d

Fabes, 2006). People who consistently engage in adaptive cognitive reappraisal tend to have

te

stable, close interpersonal relationships and more positive emotions than do people who do not
readily engage in reappraisal. Those who habitually suppress emotion, on the other hand,
experience more negative affect and often experience inauthenticity, or a sense of externally

presenting a false persona (Gross & John, 2003).
Emotion dysregulation is a transdiagnostic risk factor (i.e., a fundamental process

underlying multiple disorders or symptoms) for psychopathology. In the developmental
psychopathology literature, for example, there is a strong association between ER impairments
and development of internalizing problems, such as anxiety and depression (e.g., SouthamGerow & Kendall, 2000). McLaughlin and colleagues (2011) demonstrated, in one of the few
longitudinal studies in the field, that ER deficits prospectively predicted not only changes in

4

EMOTION REGULATION AND ANXIETY IN ASD

adolescents’ anxiety but also aggressive behavior and eating pathology. Conversely,
psychopathology did not predict subsequent ER deficits.
Although there is little empirical research on ER in ASD, there has been considerable

ip
t

study of the experience and expression of emotion in ASD. This research has demonstrated that
people with ASD often have poorly differentiated emotional responses and self-knowledge, tend

cr

to experience more negative emotion, and are harder to soothe once aroused, relative to peers

us

without ASD (e.g., Konstantareas & Stewart, 2006). From infancy through adulthood,
individuals with ASD are often described as having low levels of positive affect along with

an

heightened negative affect and dysregulated behavior, compared to peers without ASD (Garon et
al., 2009; Mazefsky, Pelphrey, & Dahl, 2012). Children with ASD, when frustrated, display

M

more intense and prolonged periods of resignation (i.e., giving up) and less effective ER

d

strategies (e.g., more avoidance) compared to typical peers (Jahromi, Meek, & Ober-Reynolds,

te

2012). They tend to show poor emotional insight and struggle to adequately express emotion
via verbalization, facial expression, or other nonverbal means (e.g., Losh & Capps, 2006).
Our goal is to offer an evidence-informed heuristic for understanding ER impairments as

a risk factor that may manifest as anxiety in people with ASD. Among psychiatric comorbidities
seen in ASD, anxiety disorders are the most common (deBruin, Ferdinand, Meester, de Nijs, &
Verheij, 2007; Joshi et al., 2010; White et al., 2009), affecting about 40% of children and
adolescents with ASD (van Steensel, Bogels, & Perrin, 2011). As noted above, we propose that
ER impairments, through a host of biological and nonbiological mechanisms, are fundamentally
related to ASD. In this model, ER impairment is viewed as a transdiagnostic risk factor affected
by multiple mechanisms, which are etiologically linked to ASD (i.e., equifinality), whereas
anxiety is only one possible, though likely, outcome of impaired ER in ASD (i.e., multifinality).

EMOTION REGULATION AND ANXIETY IN ASD

Most clinical affective neuroscience research has focused on emotions as discrete
categories, where each emotion is thought to emerge from independent neurobiological systems
(for a review, see Posner, Russell, & Peterson, 2005), and this approach has yielded important

ip
t

advances in the understanding of neurobiological mechanisms of affect. However, there is strong
evidence that discrete emotion categories are constructed of more general brain networks,

cr

suggestive of a dimensional model that conceptualizes that all affective states arise from

us

common, overlapping neurophysiological systems (Lindquist, Wager, Kober, Bliss-Moreau, &
Barrett, 2012). Dimensional models of affect have a long history in psychological research

an

(Russell, 2003) including the circumplex model of affect that proposes that all affective states
arise from two fundamental neurobiological systems defined by the near-orthogonal dimensions

M

of valence (i.e., pleasure-displeasure) and arousal (i.e., alertness or vigor; Russell, 1980). This

d

framework suggests that every emotion may be represented on the basis of varying degrees of

te

valence and arousal. For example, feeling tense is the product of a negatively valenced and
highly aroused emotional state; whereas feeling serene is the product of a positively valenced
and low arousal state.

The circumplex model of affect suggests that dysregulated arousal systems would have a
direct impact on the experience of all emotions, and Tseng and colleagues (2013) recently found
that a circumplex model of experienced affect is characteristic of individuals with ASD. One
potential mechanistic account for impaired ER, and the resultant increased anxiety, in ASD is
that individuals on the spectrum may experience heightened levels of basal or reactive arousal.
Arousal is regulated by connections between the reticular formation in the brainstem and the
limbic system, including the amygdala, and the thalamus and parietal lobes (Heilman, 2000), and
there is evidence of impairments in functional and structural connectivity between the brainstem

6

EMOTION REGULATION AND ANXIETY IN ASD

and limbic system in ASD (Elison et al., 2013; Fatemi, et al., 2012). Additionally, a
comprehensive functional neuroimaging literature implicates impaired processing of emotional
stimuli in ASD (for a review, see Dichter, 2012). To the extent that arousal systems may be

ip
t

dysregulated in ASD, this would have a direct influence on the experience of affective states,
potentially contributing to impaired ER in ASD.

cr

In addition to neural and physiological mechanisms that affect regulatory capacity, there

us

are cognitive and social processes that influence the experience of, and ability to intentionally
alter, emotion. In typical development, ER emerges rapidly, largely through interactions between

an

the child and parent. Just as altered interactions between a child (or infant) and the social
environment can affect, and be affected by, the child’s temperament (Dawson, 2008), this

M

interaction can also affect ER development. In the following sections, we explore these broad

d

domains of mediational mechanisms – socio-cognitive, neural, and physiological, as they relate

to understanding impaired ER in people with ASD.

Familial socialization of appropriate emotional responding, often referred to as emotion
coaching, plays a critical role in the development of ER in non-ASD populations (e.g.,
Dunsmore, Booker, & Ollendick, 2013). Theoretical models, supported by a wealth of research,
indicate that young children develop ER skills through observational learning, modeling, and
social referencing (Morris, Silk, Steinberg, Myers, & Robinson, 2007). This is largely a
spontaneous process that happens through family interactions without explicit instruction or
directive teaching for most children. However, child characteristics can moderate this process

7

EMOTION REGULATION AND ANXIETY IN ASD

(Morris et al., 2007), and the prominent social deficits in ASD may interfere with the
observational learning of ER in early childhood.
Whereas typically developing infants demonstrate a natural preference for others’ faces,

ip
t

early development in ASD is characterized by reduced social attention and motivation (e.g.,

Dawson, Meltzoff, Osterling, Rinaldi, & Brown, 1998), and diminished salience and abnormal

cr

perception of social cues, based on eye-tracking and electrophysiological studies (Dawson,

us

Webb, & McPartland, 2007). Further, attention to others’ eyes may decline by 6 months of age in
infants later diagnosed with ASD (Jones & Klin, 2013). This suggests that reduced social interest

an

is evident by the time young children who later develop ASD should be vicariously learning
foundational ER skills from their interactions with others (e.g., parents, siblings). Given the

M

interdependence of social and emotional development, it is not surprising that individuals with

d

ASD present with ER impairments.

te

One of the fundamental ER skills acquired early in development is emotion recognition.
Competence in interpersonal situations is highly dependent on awareness of one’s own emotions
and those of others (Saarni, 1999). Accuracy in emotion recognition is requisite for higher level

emotional and social understanding (Jones et al., 2011). Difficulty recognizing, and especially
labeling, emotions in self and others may directly and indirectly impede effective ER. Tupak and
colleagues (2014) found that affect labeling was associated with activation of the ventrolateral
prefrontal cortex (VLPFC) in a healthy population. These findings suggest that an inability to
recognize and label emotions could lead to under-activation of neural regions directly involved
in implicit ER. Indirectly, misperception or misinterpretation of emotional signals could hamper
ER.

EMOTION REGULATION AND ANXIETY IN ASD

Findings from research on emotion recognition deficits in ASD are quite mixed (e.g.,
Harms, Martin, & Wallace, 2010; Jones et al., 2011). Kennedy and Adolphs (2012), for example,
found that adults with ASD demonstrated decreased sensitivity in emotion perception relative to

ip
t

non-affected adults. Likewise, Tanaka and colleagues (2012) reported decreased ability to

generalize facial emotions across identities. On the other hand, Ozonoff and colleagues (1990)

cr

found that although children with ASD displayed some deficits in emotion perception relative to

us

non-affected controls, the deficits were not seen uniformly across experimental tasks and were
not present when the control children were matched to those with ASD on verbal ability.

an

Although the existence of a global and pervasive deficit in emotion recognition in ASD
has not been firmly established, Uljarevic and Hamilton (2013) reported results from a meta-

M

analysis of 48 emotion recognition studies representing data from over 980 participants with

d

ASD, indicating that ‘basic’ emotions (anger, sadness, surprise, fear, disgust) were recognized

te

less accurately in ASD, with the exception of happiness, which appeared to be (marginally)
intact overall. Interestingly, neither age nor IQ moderated this effect, suggesting that although
the effect may not be truly global (due to apparently preserved recognition of happiness), the

mixed results may be due to the dramatic heterogeneity in tasks used to measure this process
(e.g. emotion-labeling tasks, emotion-matching tasks) as well as heterogeneity in the participant
groups involved in these studies. Despite these inconsistencies, it can be concluded that more
demanding tasks with subtle stimuli are most challenging, there are some emotion-specific
difficulties (e.g., fear and sadness; Tell, Davidson, & Camras, 2014), and people with ASD
improve developmentally in this skill but never reach typical adult proficiency (Rump,
Giovannelli, Minshew, & Strauss, 2009).

EMOTION REGULATION AND ANXIETY IN ASD

Although the exact nature of emotion recognition deficits in ASD is not resolved, it is
generally agreed that the manner in which emotional expression is processed and interpreted is
atypical in ASD. Research in both children and adults suggests that individuals with ASD are

ip
t

more likely than typically-developing individuals to interpret ambiguous or neutral faces as

negative, suggesting a possible bias (Eack, Mazefsky, & Minshew, 2014; Kuusikko et al., 2009).

cr

Moreover, neuroimaging and eye-tracking research has generally found differences between

us

people with and without ASD, across metrics, on emotion recognition tasks even when
performance deficits are not found (see Harms et al., 2010 for review), which suggests

an

engagement of compensatory approaches for emotion recognition. One such compensatory
strategy may be application of a rule-based approach (e.g., smile indicates happiness) to emotion

M

interpretation, rather than the more typical application of a ‘prototype’ of a given emotion

d

(Walsh et al., 2014). Prior eye-tracking research has indeed found differences in the visual

te

scanpaths of people with ASD when viewing emotional faces (Gross, 2004; Klin, Jones, Schultz,
Volkmar, & Cohen 2002). This line of reasoning was first suggested based on failure to find an
inversion effect in ASD, which involves slowed facial identification when a face is presented

upside down (see Sasson, 2006 for review). In further support of this, Tanaka et al. (2012)
reported a tendency to process facial features as isolated, non-integrated parts within a sample of
children, adolescents, and adults with ASD. Additionally, affect-matching paradigms tend to
result in more sizeable group differences in facial emotion recognition ability than do affect
labeling paradigms (e.g., Davies et al., 1994; Piggot et al., 2004; Rump et al., 2009). This
suggests that more cognitively and verbally able individuals with ASD might engage less
automatic cognitive and linguistic strategies to decode emotions than typically developing
individuals (Harms et al., 2010).

EMOTION REGULATION AND ANXIETY IN ASD

Compared with research on the perception of emotion in others, there has been less work
on the ability of people with ASD to recognize and express their own affect. There is, however,
evidence for impaired access to and expression of consciously felt emotion (Shalom et al., 2006).

ip
t

Children with ASD smile less often and tend to not show self-conscious affect, relative to

children without ASD (Dawson & McKissick, 1984; Mundy & Sigman, 1989; Spiker & Ricks,

cr

1984). Finally, difficulty in identifying, distinguishing, and describing one’s own emotions

us

(often referred to alexithymia) has been documented in ASD samples (e.g., Rieffe, Terwogt, &
Kotronopoulou, 2007). These impairments may interfere with successful ER in ASD given that

the capacity to label, and communicate about, one’s own emotions are essential aspects of
effortful ER (Mazefsky & White, 2013).

Attention, Working Memory, and Cognitive Control

Monitoring and altering the course of emotional experience requires attentional and

cognitive processes. There has been a wealth of research on cognitive processes in ASD,
including research on attention, working memory, and information processing. Although this
research has rarely explicitly focused on how differences in these cognitive processes impact

emotional functioning in ASD, research in typically developing samples and other clinical
populations has established the importance of higher order cognitive processes and executive
functions in ER (Ochsner & Gross, 2005; Zelanzo & Cunningham, 2007). Below we consider
how understanding cognitive functioning in ASD may inform the understanding of observed ER
deficits in ASD.
Effective ER is characterized by adaptive, goal-directed behavior, which requires the
integration of multiple components of executive function. For example, internal goal
representations must be kept in awareness while inhibiting interfering cognitions and behaviors

11

EMOTION REGULATION AND ANXIETY IN ASD

(Solomon, Ozonoff, Cummings, & Carter, 2008). Cognitive control refers to the ability to
reallocate mental resources in the service of values and goals. Key components of cognitive
control related to ER include attentional control and controlled cognitive change (Ochsner &

ip
t

Gross, 2005). For example, an adaptive response may require limiting attention to a negative
stimulus and focusing attention on salient aspects of the context to arrive at the most appropriate

cr

response. Flexible, integrated cognitive responses are required to generate or regulate an

us

emotion.

Impairments in cognitive flexibility and the ability to shift attentional focus have been

an

well-documented in ASD (Hill, 2008; Ozonoff, Coon, Dawson, Joseph, Klin, & McMahon,
2004; Ozonoff & Strayer, 1997; Rinehart, Bradshaw, Moss, Brereton, & Tonge, 2001). This has

M

been demonstrated as a tendency to perseverate, or cogitate on one thought or task to the

d

exclusion of other thoughts and behaviors. Perseveration is a clinical concern because such

te

focused attention impedes appropriate task switching. Problems with shifting attention are also
observed in the form of difficulty disengaging attention to perform a task (e.g., Landry &
Bryson, 2004). The tendency to hyper-focus on aspects of a situation at the exclusion of other,

potentially more relevant, signals extends beyond perceptual processes (Ozonoff, Strayer,
McMahon, & Filloux, 1994) to a problem with higher-order demands for conceptual integration.
Manifest difficulties with cognitive rigidity can be couched in the theory of Weak Central
Coherence (WCC; Frith, 1989; Frith & Happé, 1994), which holds that individuals with ASD
have relative strengths in local processing and may lack the automatic drive to integrate stimuli
to make global meaning of context. The information processing approach of people with ASD is
often piecemeal and detail-oriented, regardless of salience or meaning of the gestalt. This may

also present as over-reliance on specific responses or scripts, even when such behaviors are not
ideal for the situational demands.
Inflexibility can also reflect difficulty inhibiting a response that interferes with goal-

ip
t

directed behavior. In a cross-sectional study, Ozonoff et al. (2004) found that adolescents with
ASD made more errors than typically developing adolescents on a task requiring inhibition of

cr

prepotent responses compared with children under the age of 12. In addition, adolescents with

us

ASD made more errors than did younger children with ASD, suggestive of a lack of age-related
improvement during adolescence in ASD.

Problems with the conceptual integration of information in ASD can result in a host of
cascading and reciprocal effects on behaviors with relevance to ER, including difficulty with

perspective-taking, an inability to think hypothetically, and an impaired ability to develop novel

d

behavioral solutions to problems (Dunlop, Knott, & MacKay, 2008; Hill, 2008; Pugliese &

te

White, 2014; Reed & Peterson, 1990). For example, set-shifting difficulties may also be related
to the inability to recognize that one’s solution is faulty (Perner, 1998). Arguably, most situations
that demand regulation of emotion in daily life are not planned, lack clear rules for how to best

handle the situation, and require disengagement from the emotional trigger. Cognitive
perseveration, along with deficits in perspective-taking, may contribute to the inability to see
more than one side of a situation (making reappraisal difficult) and contribute to emotional
rumination, collectively leading to impaired ER.
Summary
The rich research on the maturation of ER abilities in typically developing children can
shed light on how ER impairments arise in ASD. From very early in life, caregivers play a
considerable role in helping the young child self-regulate emotion (e.g., Rothbart & Bates, 2006).

13
Page 15 of 76

EMOTION REGULATION AND ANXIETY IN ASD

As the child’s inhibitory control, attention, and ability to self-soothe improve, parental control
over the child’s regulation is gradually scaffolded (Eisenberg & Sulik, 2012). In ASD, normative
social orienting (e.g., child attending to parent) is derailed early in development (Dawson, 2008;

ip
t

Jones & Klin, 2013). There are often deficits in cognitive control, flexibility, and problem-

solving (e.g., Ozonoff et al., 1994; Rinehart et al., 2001), all higher order skills involved in ER.

cr

Although the research has been mixed, there is evidence too of deficits in foundational skills for

us

ER, such as emotion awareness, recognition, and accurate expression (e.g., Eack et al., 2014;
Harms et al., 2010; Rieffe et al., 2007). As such, the development of ER ability may be hindered

an

in ASD, via processes related to wayward socialization, impaired executive function, and fairly
rudimentary emotion awareness and recognition skills.

Physiological Mechanisms

The idea that ASD is a disorder of irregular resting-state physiology dates back to Hutt

te

and colleagues (1964), who suggested that those with ASD have a ‘‘chronically high state of
arousal’’ (p. 908), and is now supported by multiple lines of evidence suggesting that ASD is
characterized by altered levels of basal and reactive arousal. One indirect line of evidence is the

well-documented finding that individuals with ASD gaze less at the eye regions of images of
faces (Kliemann, Dziobek, Hatri, Steimke, & Heekeren, 2010; Klin et al., 2002; Pelphrey, et al.,
2002), a pattern that has been suggested to reflect a state of over-arousal (Levine et al., 2012;
Riby, Whittle, & Doherty-Sneddon, 2012) linked to hyperactive amygdala activation when
looking at the eye regions of the face (Dalton et al., 2005). Below, we describe some of the most
prominent approaches utilized in physiological research on emotion processes and their
application to understanding ASD.
Startle Responses

14
Page 16 of 76

EMOTION REGULATION AND ANXIETY IN ASD

A number of studies have suggested differences in basal states of arousal on the basis of
altered magnitudes of the startle eyeblink response. The startle eyeblink response is an obligatory
reflex elicited by a startling probe, the magnitude of which is modulated by internal states of

ip
t

arousal, attention, and valence (Bradley, Codispoti, Cuthbert, & Lang, 2001; Lang & Davis,
2006). Fear-potentiation of the startle response is mediated by projections from the central

cr

nucleus of the amygdala (Hitchcock & Davis, 1991), and there is a large literature documenting

us

altered fear-potentiated startle responses in anxiety disorders (Lang, Davis, & Ohman, 2000).
Although Sterling and colleagues (2013) reported normal threat-potentiated startle responses in

an

adolescents with ASD and found that startle responses did not predict levels of anxiety or social
impairments, Chamberlain and colleagues (2013) reported greater absolute startle responsivity at

M

baseline and throughout a threat-potentiated startle experiment in adolescents with ASD, despite

d

no differences in startle modulation due to cued or uncued threat, suggesting context-general

te

enhanced arousal in threatening contexts.

Modulation of the startle response may be measured in the context of both pleasant and
unpleasant stimuli, and the degree of startle attenuation in appetitive contexts and augmentation

in withdrawal contexts (i.e., affective modulation of the startle response) is known to reflect both
the arousal and valence properties of the contextual affective stimuli (Lang, Bradley, & Cuthbert,
1998). Studies of affective modulation of the startle response in ASD have found evidence of
startle eyeblink magnitude potentiation while viewing pleasant normative images, despite no
differences in affective ratings of images relative to subjects without ASD (Dichter, Benning,
Holtzclaw, & Bodfish, 2010; Wilbarger, McIntosh, & Winkielman, 2009) as well as potentiation
while viewing pleasant social images (Cohen, Masyn, Mastergeorge, & Hessl, 2013). Wilbarger
and colleagues (2009) also reported intact implicit valence responses, reflected in facial

EMOTION REGULATION AND ANXIETY IN ASD

electromyography (EMG), suggesting that aberrant startle eyeblink responses to pleasant pictures
may reflect impaired processing of picture arousal rather than valence. In addition, Dichter and
colleagues (2010) found evidence of impaired startle-induced postauricular modulation in the

ip
t

context of unpleasant pictures, further suggesting that patterns of altered startle responses are not
due to picture valence, but instead more likely picture arousal, in contexts where startle reflexes

cr

should be attenuated but rather are amplified. Finally, Mathersul and colleagues (2013) found no

differences in startle modulation or electromyography activity (i.e., orbicularis, zygomaticus,
corrugator) in adults with ASD to normative neutral, pleasant, and unpleasant images, though

an

this study used extremely intense images (e.g., erotica and mutilation) which may have elicited
more normative responses. In summary, available startle eyeblink modulation data suggests

mixed evidence of enhanced fear-potentiated startle, but more consistent evidence of startle

potentiation in positive affective contexts likely linked to processing the arousing properties of

affective images. Though more research is needed, this pattern suggests that altered states of
arousal in ASD may impact processing of arousing positive stimuli, including images of faces.

The skin conductance response (SCR; electrodermal activity) is a psychophysiological
index of autonomic arousal, reflecting an orienting response that is elicited by salient
environmental stimuli (particularly socially relevant information) (Critchley, 2002; Sequeira,
Hot, Silvert, & Delplanque, 2009). It mobilizes physiologic resources to facilitate behavioral
responses and reflects arousal and motivation (Lang, 1995). Research into autonomic
responsivity, as measured by SCRs in ASD, is highly inconsistent and does not clearly indicate
altered states of autonomic arousal in ASD. A number of SCR studies have found evidence of
hyper-arousal in children and adolescents with ASD. van Engeland and colleagues (1991)

16
Page 18 of 76

EMOTION REGULATION AND ANXIETY IN ASD

reported larger SCRs to novel stimuli but normalized SCR when subjective, idiosyncratically
arousing stimuli were added to the novel stimuli. Kylliainen and Hietanen (2006) reported
higher SCRs to socially-relevant stimuli in children with ASD, and Joseph and colleagues (2008)

ip
t

reported relatively larger SCRs in children with ASD to face images with direct and averted

gaze. Hirstein and colleagues (2001) reported that children with ASD did not show a larger SCR

cr

to images of their mother versus an image of a cup. Finally, Cohen and colleagues (2013)

us

reported that adolescents with ASD and with ASD plus Fragile X had larger SCRs than controls
while viewing pleasant and unpleasant pictures, reflective of a general state of hyper-arousal.

an

However, research on atypical SCRs in people with ASD has not consistently been
suggestive of hyper-arousal. Indeed, a number of studies have found lower SCRs in ASD. Hubert

M

and colleagues (2009) reported lower SCRs in adults with ASD during an emotional face

d

judgment task. Mathersul and colleagues (2013) found an overall dampening of SCRs to socially

te

pleasant, but not neutral, images in adults with ASD. This was interpreted as a failure to orient to
socially relevant stimuli and a greater relative allocation of attention to neutral images. This
study also reported decreased evoked cardiac acceleration (ECA) to social pleasant images,

suggesting reduced perceived motivational intensity of these images, yet no differences in
evoked cardiac deceleration (ECD) to any image category. The authors interpreted these
findings to reflect intact initial automatic orienting to affective stimuli (reflected in the ECD
response) but that this attentional allocation fails to sustain over time, reflected in dampening of
SCRs. Finally, Riby and colleagues (2012) found lower SCRs in individuals with ASD relative
to controls and to participants with Williams Syndrome, and did not show physiological
reactivity differentiation between groups to happy, sad, and neutral live and video faces,
suggestive of decreased arousal across social contexts. Kushki and colleagues (2013) reported

17
Page 19 of 76

EMOTION REGULATION AND ANXIETY IN ASD

elevated SCRs while watching a neutral movie but blunted SCRs during an anxiety-provoking
Stroop task (and elevated heart rate during both conditions) in children with ASD, suggesting
context-specific and perhaps paradoxical autonomic system dysfunction in contexts eliciting

ip
t

anxiety (i.e., a larger SCR at baseline but smaller SCR during a task meant to elicit anxiety).
Finally, Shalom and colleagues (2006) found no differences in SCRs to pleasant, neutral,

cr

and unpleasant images between children with ASD and controls despite divergent affective

us

ratings of the images, and Louwerse and colleagues (2014) found no group differences in SCRs,
heart rate, or subjective responses to social and nonsocial affective image in adolescents with an

an

ASD. Blair (1999) reported no differences in SCRs to distressing, threatening, or neutral stimuli
in children with ASD, indicative of intact autonomic and subjective responses to stimuli with and

M

without a social content. South and colleagues (2011) recorded SCR during a simple

d

discrimination conditioning task in children and adolescents with and without ASD and found no

te

differences in baseline SCRs or group differences in SCRs to conditioned stimuli. However, they
found that SCRs to conditioned fear stimuli in the ASD group was associated with symptoms of
social anxiety (positive association) and social functioning (negative association).

Cardiovascular Activity

Respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) is a measure of heart rate variability related to
breathing that is influenced by the parasympathetic branch of the autonomic nervous system. The
amplitude of RSA is widely applied as an index of the myelinated vagus function or cardiac
vagal tone (Berntson, Cacioppo, & Grossman, 2007; Grossman & Taylor, 2007). Vagal tone,
RSA, and other measures of heart rate may be useful metrics for understanding parasympathetic
responses to stress related to ER (Porges, Doussard-Roosevelt, & Maiti, 1994). The
interpretation of RSA is dependent on state, with different expectations for resting state versus

18
Page 20 of 76

EMOTION REGULATION AND ANXIETY IN ASD

change-related measures (Mazefsky et al., 2013). Polyvagal theory proposes that higher baseline
RSA is associated with better social interaction and ER, whereas low levels, as well as unreliable
RSA modulation, confer risk for problems in these areas (Porges, 2007). This theory has been

ip
t

widely supported, with high frequency heart rate and reduced vagal control (as measured by

RSA) found in populations with anxiety or depression (Licht et al., 2009; Rottenberg, 2007).

cr

Consistent with Polyvagal Theory, there is some research supporting a link between

us

higher baseline RSA amplitudes and better social behavior in ASD (Patriquin, Scarpa, Friedman,
& Porges, 2013). Along the same lines, Klusek and colleagues (2013) reported dampened vagal

an

tone in boys with ASD that was correlated with pragmatic (i.e., social) language impairments.
These findings are consistent with research indicating low parasympathetic activity, including

M

lower heart rate variability, at rest in ASD (Cohen et al., 2013; Ming et al., 2005). On the other

d

hand, research investigating the relationship between RSA and vagal tone modulation and ER-

te

related concepts in ASD is quite limited and findings are mixed. Levine et al. (2012) found no
difference in vagal tone responses to stress between participants with ASD and typical controls.
Conversely, a study of 14 children with ASD found lower baseline levels of RSA, lower heart

rate variability, and higher heart rates, reflective of decreased parasympathetic nervous system
activity, compared to typically developing controls (Guy, Souders, Bradstreet, DeLussey, &
Herrington, 2014). Further, decreased RSA was associated with more severe parent-reported
anxiety symptoms (Guy et al., 2014). Similarly, Moskowitz et al (2013) found that lowerfunctioning children with ASD had higher heart rates and lower RSA in high versus low anxiety
conditions. These two studies suggest lower baseline levels of RSA in ASD, as well as an
association between resting RSA and anxiety. Although one might also expect poorly modulated
RSA in ASD, more research is needed to determine whether or not this is uniformly the case.

Pupillometry
Pupillometry involves the measurement of changes in pupil diameter, to index the
intensity of mental activity and changes in attention and perception (Laeng, Sirois, & Gredebäck,

ip
t

2012). Given its noninvasive nature, this metric has grown more popular as a general measure of
overall brain activity or emotional reactivity. Nuske and colleagues (2014) reported no

cr

differences in resting-state (tonic) pupil size in children with ASD, although two studies

us

(Anderson & Colombo, 2009; Anderson, Colombo, & Unruh, 2013) reported larger tonic pupil
sizes, indicative of hyperarousal, in young children with ASD. Martineau and colleagues (2011)

an

also found a difference, but in the opposite direction. Specifically, they reported smaller mean
pupil size in children with ASD while viewing neutral faces, virtual faces, and objects. Fan and

M

colleagues (2009) reported that children with ASD had longer transient pupillary light reflex

d

(PLR) latency, smaller constriction amplitude and lower constriction velocity than children with

te

typical development. In sum, although the majority of pupillometry studies in ASD have found
differences compared to typically-developing children, the type of differences and direction of
effects have been variable. Additional research is needed to better understand how pupillometry

(particularly related to ER) on pupilometry indices.
Salivary Cortisol

Hydrocortisone, usually referred to as cortisol, is a steroid hormone that is excreted
during or after stress in humans as part of the systematic arousal of the HPA axis (Staufenbiel,
Penninx, Spijker, Elzinga, & van Rossum, 2013). Whereas some studies of cortisol in ASD have
suggested chronic cortisol over-responsiveness (e.g., Bitsika, Sharpley, Sweeney, & McFarlane,
2014), others have found a blunted or decreased cortisol response (Levine et al., 2012). Wide

20
Page 22 of 76

EMOTION REGULATION AND ANXIETY IN ASD

variability in cortisol levels between children with ASD has been reported (Corbett, Schupp,
Levine, & Mendoza, 2009). Among non-ASD samples, large intraindividual variability exists as
well, with genetics, gender, and smoking noted as some key contributors to this variability (see

ip
t

Kirschbaum & Hellhammer, 1994 for review). The degree of social impairment appears to play a
role in cortisol levels in ASD, with lower cortisol levels associated with more social motivation

(Corbett et al., 2013).

There is also a well-established relationship between cortisol levels and stress responses
in the non-ASD literature (see Dickerson & Kemeny, 2004 for review). Research on cortisol

an

levels in samples with clinical anxiety varies across the specific disorder studied, though most
often there is a reduction in cortisol levels with effective treatment (see Elnazer & Baldwin, 2014

for review). One would expect that degree of emotion dysregulation and anxiety may also drive

d

cortisol differences in ASD. Indeed, there is some support for higher peak cortisol and prolonged

te

duration and recovery of cortisol elevation in children with ASD after a stressful experience
(e.g., blood draw; Spratt et. al, 2011). One might similarly expect the degree of anxiety in ASD
to correspond with cortisol levels; however, one small study found no relationship between self-

Summary

In summary, the literature addressing physiological measures of arousal in ASD, though
mixed, is generally supportive of altered states of basal and reactive arousal. Evidence of larger
startle responsivity at baseline, in threatening contexts, and while processing positive and social
stimuli is suggestive of heightened states of arousal in ASD. The literature on SCRs in ASD is
particularly mixed, with evidence of unimpaired, larger, and smaller reactivity, but the
preponderance of studies support altered SCRs, suggesting a failure to orient appropriately to

21

EMOTION REGULATION AND ANXIETY IN ASD

both social and nonsocial environmental stimuli. There is also support for low parasympathetic
activity at rest in ASD, as indicated by relatively low baseline RSA and vagal tone, a pattern that
is typically associated with greater social and emotional impairment (Porges, 1997). Studies

utilizing both pupillometry and cortisol measures in ASD generally report differences compared
to typically-developing controls, though the direction of effects is variable. Given the ability of

many of these these physiologic measures of arousal to index very rapid responses to the

environment (i.e., on the order of milliseconds), these data suggest altered orienting to the
environment very early in the stream of information processing in ASD.

2005; though see Etkin et al., 2009, 2010 for studies of implicit ER). Increasingly, these data
suggest that consciously deployed attempts to alter an emotional experience are mediated via
effects of prefrontal cortex (PFC) on limbic regions that alter experiential, behavioral, and
neurobiological aspects of emotional responses (Dillon & Labar, 2005; Eipprt et al., 2007; Gross,
1998; Jackson, Malmstadt, Larson, & Davidson, 2000; Johnstone, van Reekum, Urry, Kalin, &
Davidson, 2007; Ray, McRae, Ochsner, & Gross, 2010; Urry et al., 2006). Specifically,
conscious changes in emotional responses are brought about by dorsolateral, ventrolateral, and

medial PFC regions involved in cognitive control as well as by subcortical regions involved in
arousal and motivation, including limbic and brainstem regions and medial and orbitofrontal

amygdala activation (Ochsner et al., 2004; Phan et al., 2005). This pattern highlights an
important relationship between emotion and cognition in ER contexts, such that dorsal cognitive
abilities modulate ventral affective responses (Ayduk, Mischel, & Downey, 2002).
Largely overlapping PFC regions mediate intentional attempts to change positive
emotional responses (Kim & Hamann, 2007); however the corresponding activation of limbic
regions, including the amygdala and nucleus accumbens, is increased (Heller et al., 2009;
Ochsner et al., 2004) suggesting that cognitive control affects both the up- and down-regulation
of emotion and depends on the valence of the ER target. The degree of success of reappraisal has

23

also been correlated with activity in regions of PFC (Eippert et al., 2007; Kober et al., 2008;
Levesque et al., 2003; Wager, Davidson, Hughes, Lindquist, & Ochsner, 2008), anterior
cingulate cortex (Phan et al., 2005), and amygdala (Eippert et al., 2007; Phan et al., 2005), and

with the degree of correlation between the amygdala and mPFC (Banks, Eddy, Angstadt, Nathan,

Despite the increasing evidence that ER impairments play a key role in ASD, studies

psychiatric controls in behavioral accuracy when identifying gender (e.g., Spencer et al., 2011).
In a large study using this task in individuals with ASD, their unaffected siblings, and matched
controls, Spencer et al. (2011) reported reduced activity in a network of socio-affective brain
regions including superior temporal sulcus (STS), orbitofrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex
and fusiform face area (FFA). Of note, these patterns were observed in both the affected ASD
group and the unaffected siblings and were specific to happy (but not fearful) faces, suggesting
that neural anomalies in emotion processing may be potential neural endophenotypes of ASD.
Using the same gender-identification task, acute tryptophan depletion (resulting in reduced

24

serotonin synthesis) was found to differentially affect neural activation depending on emotion
type, such that those with ASD, following acute tryptophan depletion, showed generally
decreased responses in socio-affective brain regions to emotional faces, except those expressing

ip
t

fear (Daly et al., 2012). Also in an incidental emotion processing task, ASD participants showed
decreased amygdala habituation to both sad and neutral (but not fearful or happy) faces, and the

cr

diminished habituation was associated with increased autism symptom severity (Swartz,

Wiggins, Carrasco, Lord, & Monk, 2013). Moreover, the ASD group showed reduced mPFCamygdala connectivity while viewing sad faces, and this connectivity predicted amygdala

habituation to sad faces in controls, suggesting that abnormal modulation of the amygdala by the
mPFC may play a role in decreased habituation and the socio-affective impairments in ASD.

Medial PFC anomalies have also been reported in ASD participants performing emotion

identification tasks and social decision-making tasks, suggesting neural impairments in self-

related socio-affective processing. Specifically, when asked to identify emotions in pictures of

impaired behavioral accuracy particularly in the 'self' condition (Schulte-Ruther et al., 2011).
Similarly, in a social decision-making task involving monetary exchange between human
partners, high-functioning adolescents with ASD showed diminished dorsal cingulate cortex
activity specifically during the 'self' decision-making phase, and the diminished neural responses
varied parametrically with autism symptom severity (Chiu et al., 2008). In this study, similar to
research employing the gender-identification task, the ASD group did not differ from matched
controls in behavioral responses to signals of social partners. Together, these neuroimaging data
suggest atypical self-awareness or self-related cognitive strategies in ASD that may contribute to

25

impaired insight into internal emotional states, a critical skill for optimal emotional functioning
and socio-emotional regulation.
In an intriguing study that hints at behavioral strategies to target ER anomalies, Kliemann

ip
t

and colleagues (2012) directed participants with ASD to fixate on either the eyes or mouths of
emotional faces. The fixation instruction was effective for both ASD and non-psychiatric control

participants; however, the ASD participants were more likely to look away from the eyes

following initial fixation and also showed relatively greater amygdala activation during eye

may lead to concomitant changes in neural activation that support improved ER.

Neural Substrates of Explicit ER and Cognitive Control in ASD
The studies summarized above indicate that ASD is characterized by anomalous patterns
of brain activation in emotion-eliciting contexts. However, such paradigms do not directly
address deficits in abilities to explicitly or consciously regulate emotional responses, processes
that require cognitive control of emotional states. Two preliminary studies provide some insight
into explicit ER impairments and their neural substrates in ASD. Pitskel and colleagues (2011)
reported that typically developing children showed significant down-regulation of activation in
the amygdala and insula when consciously and effortfully decreasing their affective responses to

26

EMOTION REGULATION AND ANXIETY IN ASD

gross pictures, while children with ASD did not exhibit similar down-regulation. In addition,
Dichter and colleagues (2012) reported increased right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex activation in
adults with ASD despite decreased modulation of the nucleus accumbens during explicit up-

ip
t

regulation of emotional responses to neutral social images, suggesting that individuals with ASD
show evidence of compensatory activation in PFC during active ER, but that such compensatory

activation does not result in typical modulation of emotion processing regions.

Outside of these two preliminary studies of cognitively effortful ER in ASD, there is a
broad literature on impairments in cognitive control and associated neural activation in ASD.

Muller, Pierce, Ambrose, Allen, & Courchesne, 2001), and saccadic eye movements (Muller,
Kleinhans, Kemmotsu, Pierce, & Courchesne, 2003). The broad pattern of prefrontal cortex
hyperactivation in ASD in these studies is consistent with the ER findings of Dichter and
colleagues (2012) and suggests that ASD may be characterized by compensatory PFC activation
in contexts of cognitive control of both emotional and non-emotional information.

Neural Connectivity Among Socio-Affective Regions in ASD
The studies reviewed thus far are largely derived from task-based designs in which
participants actively engage in ER-related cognitive processes (increase, decrease, or sustain

ip
t

emotions); however, studies that evaluate patterns of intrinsic brain connectivity have also

revealed new insights into structural and functional alterations associated with ER impairments

cr

in ASD. Substantial data in non-clinical participants have shown that a key feature of neural

us

responses to emotional information is modulation of cortico-limbic connectivity. Though there
are no direct connections between lateral and dorsal PFC and the amygdala, there are indirect

an

connections via mPFC (Maren & Quirk, 2004; Ongur & Price, 2000). Specifically, changes in
emotional responses are associated with connectivity between PFC and limbic regions that has

also been associated with self-reported affective reactions to both negative and positive stimuli

(Heller et al., 2009; Johnstone et al., 2007; Urry et al., 2006).

te

Theoretical and empirical work has consistently underscored that ASD is likely
characterized by a complex pattern of hyper- and hypo-connectivity (Di Martino et al., 2013; Just
et al., 2012), and that developmental changes in the topology of connectivity may also play a role

in the emergence and expression of core ASD symptoms (Washington et al., 2014). While no
studies have explicitly targeted the connective properties of ER-related regions in the context of
ASD, the results of several large scale studies of whole-brain intrinsic connectivity provide some
context for understanding how ER networks might be disrupted.
The largest connectivity study to date was reported by Di Martino and colleagues (2013)
and focused on resting-state analyses of ASD data from the Autism Brain Imaging Data
Exchange (ABIDE) consortium. Whole-brain estimates of intrinsic connectivity and related
graph-theoretic parameters revealed evidence of hypo-connectivity of mid- and posterior insula

and posterior cingulate cortex, a finding highly consistent with related studies in ASD that report
anomalous connective and task-based properties of emotion-relevant regions of the brain
including the insula (Ebisch et al., 2011; Di Martino et al., 2009; Uddin & Menon, 2009). The

ip

cr

particularly for the purposes of merging information about visceral experience with affective

context (Dolan, 2002; Phillips, Drevets, Rauch, & Lane, 2003). The insula may also play a role
in coordinating the competitive interactions between task-positive (i.e., executive control;

an

Langer, & Jäncke, 2013; Klumpp Angstadt & Phan, 2012; Paulus & Stein, 2006; Stein,
Simmons, Feinstein, & Paulus, 2007), which may provide some initial clues into to the
functional overlap between ASD and anxiety.
In addition to alterations in the connective properties of brain areas implicated in the
generation and experience of emotions, there is evidence of ASD-specific alterations in
connectivity of other brain regions involved in social cognition. Bachevaliera and Loveland
(2006) have proposed that dysregulated frontostriatal-temporal connectivity mediates social

deficits in ASD, that damage to these structures results in poor social decision making (Bechara,
Damasio, Damasio, & Lee, 1999), and that structural and functional brain imaging studies have
corroborated temporal and frontal lobe abnormalities in ASD (Dichter, 2012). More recently,

resting state functional connectivity among fronto-limbic-social regions has been shown to be
markedly reduced in ASD, and the reduction is associated with increased communication deficits

anomalies associated with emotion processing in ASD that may mediate or moderate
downstream ER impairments. Specifically, the rich literature on brain correlates of socialaffective processing in ASD implicates deficits in overlapping circuitry, including the mPFC,
amygdala, cingulate cortex, and orbitofrontal cortex (though see Vander Wyk, Hoffman, &
Pelphrey (2013) for data suggesting neural activation differences may be driven by task
demands). Of importance, these brain regions are those implicated in ER and have been
identified as disrupted in explicit and implicit ER deficits across anxiety disorders (Ball,
Ramsawh, Campbell-Sills, Paulus, & Stein, 2013; Blair et al., 2012; Etkin, Prater, Hoeft, Menon,

among aberrant neural substrates of emotion processing, ASD, anxiety, and ER remain unknown,

experience of anxiety in people with ASD. Cognitive bias to perceived threat is commonly
considered an etiological factor in the development of anxiety disorders. Anxious children and
adults tend to focus attention, overtly and covertly, on potential indicators of threat or danger
(Bar-Haim, Lamy, Pergamin, Bakermans-Kranenburg, & van Ijzendoorn, 2007). Biased attention
and information processing is apparent in orienting, perception, and interpretation. For instance,
anxious people tend to show attentional bias (orienting) toward threatening faces (e.g.,
Weissman, Chu, Reddy, & Mohlman, 2012), perceive neutral faces as threatening (Yoon &
Zinbarg, 2008), and interpret ambiguous or novel stimuli negatively (Pine, Helfinstein, Bar-

31

EMOTION REGULATION AND ANXIETY IN ASD

Haim, Nelson, & Fox, 2009). Attention, essentially, is the gatekeeper in determining what
information we perceive and process.
In ASD, decreased visual attending to social cues is largely assumed to stem from lack of

ip
t

appreciation for the social relevance of eye gaze (e.g., Klin, Jones, Schultz, & Volkmar, 2003),
such that social stimuli (e.g., human faces) are not as meaningful as they are for typically

cr

developing people (Dawson et al., 2008). Eye-tracking research has generally supported this

us

view, finding that adolescents (Fletcher-Watson, Leekam, Benson, Frank, & Findlay, 2009; Klin
et al., 2002) and adults (Pelphrey et al., 2002) with ASD visually attend less to social stimuli

an

than do peers without ASD. However, research assessing gaze patterns, neural circuitry, and
autonomic arousal (e.g., Dalton et al., 2005; Joseph et al., 2008) has indicated that, for some

M

people with ASD, perhaps aversion and heightened emotional reactivity, both of which are core

gaze and facial features.

d

components of social anxiety, may contribute to the observed lack of attending to others’ eye

As such, altered alerting and attention to social and non-social stimuli may predict (or
reflect) anxiety. Decreased attending to social stimuli may, for at least some people with ASD,

stem from active avoidance or aversion, rather than decreased salience of the stimuli. It is also
possible that under-attending to social stimuli reflects over-orienting to non-social sources of
potential threat in the environment, or lack of automatic social referencing for support or comfort
when distressed. There is also preliminary evidence for a possible interpretation bias in ASD.
Kuusikko and colleagues (2009) found that youth with ASD were more likely than peers without
ASD to perceive ambiguous faces as portraying negative emotions, suggesting biased
interpretations. Eack et al (2013) similarly found that adults with ASD perceived neutral faces as
negative whereas typically developing adults did not. In summary, in the presence of atypical

32

visual attending to the environment - specifically aversion to social stimuli and bias toward threat
cues, ER impairments may be expressed as anxiety.
Social Factors

ip
t

The social impairment that is the primary defining feature of ASD may both directly

(e.g., via social confusion) and indirectly (e.g., via negative feedback from others) contribute to

cr

the manifestation of ER deficits as anxiety. Higher functioning individuals with ASD are often

us

aware of their inability to master social demands, though many such individuals place as much
emphasis on the importance of peer approval as typically developing peers (Williamson, Craig,

an

& Slinger, 2008), and many individuals with ASD are sensitive to social feedback. This
awareness is hypothesized to contribute to the development of secondary social anxiety and

M

heightened fear of negative peer evaluation (White & Roberson-Nay, 2009). Awareness of one’s

d

social impairments may interact with poor ER to produce anxiety, contributing to anxious

te

rumination and distorted interpretation of others’ intentions and responses.
In addition, it has been proposed that core features of ASD (e.g., odd social behaviors)
may in fact contribute to the development of anxiety, especially during adolescence (White et al.,

2013). Behaviors that are developmentally inappropriate for the social context (e.g., intruding
into a conversation, saying something inappropriate in class, revealing one’s belief in mythical
entities or superheroes during adolescence) often result in negative feedback from peers and
become quite humiliating for the person with ASD. Such experiences, in the context of an
inability to cope effectively with these feelings and alter one’s behavior accordingly, could
contribute to various forms (e.g., separation, social) of anxiety.
Some individuals with ASD seek social interaction and experience excessive arousal in
relation to social stimuli (Kleinhans et al., 2010; White, Bray, & Ollendick, 2012; White et al.,

33
Page 35 of 76

EMOTION REGULATION AND ANXIETY IN ASD

2010). Sensitivity to social cues, in particular faces, may moderate expression of ER deficits as
anxiety. People with ASD who have greater amygdala activation during social information
processing tasks report more difficulty with social anxiety (Kleinhans et al., 2010). Motivation

ip
t

for interactions, in the context of awareness of critical feedback and one’s own social deficits,
could engender anxiety, especially anxiety related to fear of negative evaluation, which is a

cr

hallmark of social anxiety disorder (APA, 2013). The extant research on social motivation and

us

anxiety in ASD has not consistently found evidence for social motivation in ASD, however. In a
study examining brain responses to directed versus averted gaze in emotional faces, Davies and

an

colleagues (2011) showed strong differentiation in VLPFC between directed and averted gaze in
controls, but no such differentiation in participants with ASD. The authors suggested that this

M

pattern indicates generally reduced social motivation in ASD, rather than anxiety, as eye gaze

d

cues are thought to contribute to socio-affective interpretation and regulation.

te

Individuals prone to neuroticism are more likely to develop clinical anxiety problems,
rather than a non-anxiety disorder, when the environment is chronically threatening (LeDoux,
2000). It is possible that people with ASD, including those without cognitive impairments,

struggle to navigate a social world that is devoid of clear directions or rules, and in which change
is nearly constant. Interpersonal communication may be a threatening and stressful situation for
most people on the spectrum. Adolescents with ASD show greater bilateral activation in neural
substrates involved in processing socio-emotional stimuli, specifically the amygdala, vPFC, and
striatum, relative to peers without ASD (Weng et al., 2011). This pattern suggests increased
ambiguity in interpretation of facial cues and distress owing to viewing others’ facial
expressions. Processing faces may require more effort in people with ASD, which may be
attributable to less experience with faces over the course of childhood (less cumulative

34

EMOTION REGULATION AND ANXIETY IN ASD

experience, owing to not attending to facial stimuli; e.g., Osterling & Dawson, 1994) and
impaired ability to interpret others’ facial emotions (Weng et al., 2011). Tupak and colleagues
(2014) speculated that anxiety may reflect a lowered threshold for PFC activation, owing to

ip
t

greater, nearly chronic, demand for regulation of heightened negative affect, even during nonthreatening tasks. Deficits in recognition and expression of emotions in self and others, limited

cr

social experience, and a near-constant sense of ambiguity may contribute to chronic confusion

about social world, which could give rise to anxiety.
Behavioral Factors

ER impairments also likely contribute to anxiety via conditioning and avoidance.
Inability to tolerate distress or fear and cope with these feelings contributes to conditioned fear

responses. Avoidance perpetuates anxiety, as reduction in experienced anxiety reinforces

such that ER deficits predict psychopathology such as anxiety. In addition to avoidance and

people with ASD. For example, a 10-year-old girl with ASD may experience dread related to
possible changes in her school schedule (a symptom of ASD). She may struggle to manage the
distress and seek constant reassurance from parents and teachers (poor ER). The distress
contributes to her avoidance of school, and she refuses to work at school (avoidance behaviors).
As a result, she may never develop strategies to cope with schedule changes or to manage the
associated negative affect and her anxious avoiding behaviors are strengthened.
Sensory issues have long been suggested as a possible determinant of anxiety in
individuals with ASD, and sensory symptoms correlate with anxiety severity in children with

35

EMOTION REGULATION AND ANXIETY IN ASD

ASD (Ben-Sasson et al., 2008), although the potential causal linkages and direction of effects
between anxiety and sensory over-responsivity in ASD have not yet been fully determined
(Green & Ben-Sasson, 2010). One possible mechanistic account of the relation between anxiety

ip
t

and sensory over-responsiveness in ASD is that anxious individuals with ASD may exhibit

hyper-vigilance regarding the sensory environment that causes impairments in shifting attention

cr

and decreasing accompanying negative affectivity (Craske, 2003), though, as reviewed earlier,

us

clearly not all individuals with ASD exhibit general hyper-arousal (Rogers & Ozonoff, 2005).
Alternatively, it may be the case that sensory over-responsiveness and anxiety in ASD are linked

an

via a third common causal factor, such as functional amygdala abnormalities given the role the
amygdala plays in integration of sensory input with response to perceived threat (Zald, 2003).

M

Whereas the neural substrates of anxiety in ASD have not yet been fully examined, a recent

d

study testing sensory over-responsivity in ASD provides initial evidence that sensory issues are

te

related to anxiety. In this study, in response to aversive auditory stimuli, participants with ASD,
relative to controls, displayed greater activation in primary sensory cortical areas, as well as in
the amygdala and orbital-frontal cortex, regions implicated in ER (Green et al., 2013). Of note,

activation in these areas was correlated with ratings of both anxiety and sensory overresponsivity.

Conclusions

In this review, we have presented a model that considers causal pathways to ER
impairments in ASD and factors that moderate these impairments to result in anxiety. We have
framed our examination of ER deficits and anxiety in ASD from a developmental
psychopathology lens, within the complementary processes of equifinality and multifinality (cf.
Cicchetti & Rogosch, 1996). We propose that impaired ER may be the result of a number of

36
Page 38 of 76

EMOTION REGULATION AND ANXIETY IN ASD

disease pathways (i.e., equifinality). Impaired ER, in turn, can be manifested in a multitude of
ways (i.e., multifinality), including anxiety. The clinical expression of ER impairment is affected
by cognitive, social, and behavioral factors. In Figure 1, we propose a developmental model of

ip

ER impairment and anxiety in ASD, that is adapted from Nolen-Hoeksema and Watkins’ (2011)
heuristic model for understanding how transdiagnostic processes can help explain multifinality in

cr

developmental psychopathology.

us

<Figure 1>

The primary limitation of this review is that the proposed model is largely, as yet,

an

untested and draws fairly heavily from research with other forms of psychopathology, due to the
limited body of research on ER functioning in ASD. This is perhaps most apparent in the dearth

M

of studies that have directly examined relationships between ER and anxiety in people with

d

ASD. Owing to the limited research base from which to draw, it is difficult to draw firm

te

conclusions and we have proposed a model which is yet to be tested empirically. Clearly, more
research is needed in this area. Longitudinal research, including studies of the effects of
treatments specifically targeting ER impairments, will be needed to examine the causal effects of

ER on the emergence of anxiety symptoms in children with ASD. Consideration of possible ER
impairments should also inform treatment research. Specifically, establishing temporal
precedence of change in ER function prior to change in the targeted behavioral outcomes (e.g.,
anxiety, depression) during intervention could inform our understanding of mechanisms of
change. This focus on linking the hypothesized mechanism of change with manifest clinical
effects is consistent with federal funding changes related to the structure of clinical trials.
Consistent with the model proposed by Mazefsky and colleagues (2013), we
conceptualize deficits in ER as being intrinsic to ASD, such that ASD itself affects mechanisms

37
Page 39 of 76

EMOTION REGULATION AND ANXIETY IN ASD

that give rise to ER impairments. This conceptualization differs from how ER impairments are
typically considered in other forms of psychopathology, in which ER problems presage and/or
cause the expressed pathology (McLaughlin et al., 2011). We have applied the heuristic proposed

ip
t

by Nolen-Hoeksema and Watkins (2011) to examine neural, physiologic, and socio-cognitive
distal risk processes, which mediate the experience of deficiencies in ER. ER impairments are

cr

conceptualized as an intermediate, or proximal, transdiagnostic risk factor, which can be

us

manifested in a number of ways such as aggression, intense irritability, self-harm, or anxiety. In
the final analysis, moderators of this proximal risk factor determine what specific symptoms are
