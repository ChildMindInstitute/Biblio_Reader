Background:

§

§

Converging evidence indicates that brain abnormalities in ASD involve atypical network
connectivity, yet the particular connectivity patterns and the extent to which they deviate
from those seen in typical development are currently debated.
While there is evidence supporting both greater and weaker brain network connectivity in
individuals with ASD, as compared to their typically developing (TD) peers, the
developmental framework emphasizing age-associated changes in connectivity is often
overlooked, or altogether ignored.
Recent findings suggest that, while typical development is associated with increasingly
segregated and increasingly integrated brain networks1, this pattern appears to be disrupted
in ASD.

To examine developmental trajectories of network connectivity in a sample of children and
adolescents with ASD, as compared to TD controls, using a data-driven, model-free
approach to quantify large-scale patterns of functional connectivity.

Age

METHODS

Auditory

Participants:

§

Children and adolescents with ASD and TD controls ages 7-17 years (see Participant
Characteristic Table for demographic and diagnostic data) underwent diagnostic and cognitive
testing and imaging scans in the context of an ongoing neuroimaging project.

MRI Data Acquisition:

§

GE 3T MR750 scanner with an 8-channel head coil:
§ T1 weighted SPGR anatomical sequence: 1mm3 resolution.
§ 6:10min resting state (eyes open) EPI sequence: 185 whole-brain volumes, TR = 2000ms;
TE = 30ms; 3.4mm3 isotropic resolution.

MRI Data Processing and ICA Analyses:

§

§

§

Preprocessing: slice-time-, motion-, and field-map-correction; co-registration to T1 and
normalization (to MNI) with FNIRT; spatial smoothing to a FWHM of 10mm; .008<f<.08Hz
bandpass filter; 16 nuisance regressors: 6 motion parameters, signal from WM and ventricles,
and their respective derivatives (no censoring).
Independent Component Analysis (ICA) was applied to rs-fMRI data from publicly available
ABIDE dataset.2
§ A low-motion subset of 40 age-matched TD participants from ABIDE was selected, in
order to estimate a typical template of network distribution and composition at this age
range.
§ The dual regression approach implemented in FSL MELODIC was applied to estimate
individual (participant-specific) spatial maps corresponding to the ICA-identified functional
networks (or independent components) derived from the ABIDE data.
Relationship with age and behavioral scores: Z scores associated with each network were then
correlated with age within each group, and with diagnostic measures within the ASD group.

temporally correlated fMRI BOLD signals) out of 20-component ICA (8 noise components not shown). Three
most informative orthogonal slices for each component are displayed. ICA spatial maps were converted to zstatistic images (thresholded at z > 3) and are displayed in standard MNI brain space. These components are
largely comparable with published adult templates by Smith and colleagues3,4.

§ TD participants had no family history of ASD, no personal history of neurologic or psychiatric conditions. The three groups were matched on motion
(RMSD; MASD = 0.085; MTD = 0.078; MABIDE = 0.061; all ps > .20).

§
§

Comparison of developmental trajectories of 12 prominent functional networks revealed atypical
relationship between the degree of network integration and age in the ASD group, for some – but not
for other – networks.
§ Namely, some networks (e.g., visual, motor) appeared to have matured by the age of 7, in both TD
and ASD, showing no relationship with age (between ages 7 and 17).
§ Other networks (i.e., left frontoparietal, sensorimotor, reward) had opposite maturational trajectories
in the two groups: continually increasing connectivity in TD vs. decreasing connectivity in ASD.
Additionally, some networks were more implicated in the ASD symptomatology than others (see Fig.3):
§ Eg, lesser network integration of the Reward network was related to greater ASD symptoms.
These data underscore the importance of considering developmental trends and trajectories when
characterizing brain network abnormalities in ASD.
