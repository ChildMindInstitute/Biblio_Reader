This study aimed to provide a simple way to approach group differences by independent component analysis when researching
functional connectivity changes of resting‑state network in brain disorders. We used baseline resting state functional magnetic
resonance imaging from the Alzheimer’s disease neuroimaging initiative dataset and performed independent component analysis
based on different kinds of subject selection, by including two downloaded templates and single‑subject independent component
analysis method. All conditions were used to calculate the functional connectivity of the default mode network, and to test group
differences and evaluate correlation with cognitive measurements and hippocampal volume. The default mode network functional
connectivity results most fitting clinical evaluations were from templates based on young healthy subjects and the worst results were
from heterogeneous or more severe disease groups or single‑subject independent component analysis method. Using independent
component analysis network maps derived from normal young subjects to extract all individual functional connectivities provides
significant correlations with clinical evaluations.

INTRODUCTION
Cognitive impairment is the most consistent
neurological complication of acquired and degenerative
brain disorders. The human brain is currently considered
as a network system and cognitive processing is supported
by continuous integration of information among brain
regions (van den Heuvel and Hulshoff Pol 2010). Exploring
the human brain via network approach has been proven as
practical to investigate the relation between brain operation
and human behavior and to evaluate the disorganization
of this process in neurodegenerative diseases (Bullmore
and Sporns 2009, Greicius 2008). Resting‑state functional
magnetic resonance imaging (rfMRI) is capable of
measuring the intra‑network functional connectivity (FC)

during rest (Biswal et al. 1997, Greicius et al. 2003, Lowe et
al. 2000) and has already become a popular tool to study
cognition and neurological and psychiatric brain disorders
(van den Heuvel and Hulshoff Pol 2010).
One of the most commonly used tools to analyze rfMRI
data is the independent component analysis (ICA), which is
a statistical model‑free method and is applicable to process
whole‑brain voxel‑wise data. In this method, hidden
sources from observed data are assumed to be linear
mixtures of independent sources. Group ICA has been
developed to simultaneously evaluate multiple subjects,
usually through temporal concatenation approach, and
the resultant resting‑state networks (RSNs) can be easily
selected to compare group differences (van den Heuvel and
Hulshoff Pol 2010, Calhoun et al. 2009). Although separate
group ICAs for different study groups are sometimes

performed (Harrison et al. 2008a, 2008b), problems of
false‑positive group differences may occur (Calhoun et
al. 2001, Beckmann et al. 2005). Therefore, in general,
all patient and control subjects are included to perform
combined group ICA (Calhoun et al. 2009).
RSNs selected from the ICA maps are consistent
across healthy subjects (Damoiseaux et al. 2006), but
will change in spatial distribution, signal intensity, and
internal connection pattern when the brain is diseased
(Littow et al. 2015, Hafkemeijer et al. 2012, Wang et al.
2013), suggesting that the patterns of RSNs based on ICA
maps resulting from subjects with different characteristics
are significantly dissimilar. Nonetheless, these group
differences of RSNs might be obscured by performing
combined group ICA because the resultant spatial maps
are required to be universally present across all subjects in
this method, and thereby, the differences across subjects
are blurred (Anderson et al. 2011). From the literature
review, this problem is mainly handled by clustering
single‑subject ICA results instead of performing group
ICA, such as self‑organizing clustering method, bagged
clustering method, and group ICA with intrinsic reference,
all of which avoid the required assumption of common
functional networks across all subjects in group ICA. These
methods reflect the individual functional network better
and the resultant ICA components are more correlated
with individual components than those from traditional
group ICA (Anderson et al. 2011, Shi et al. 2015, Esposito
et al. 2005). Computing intra‑network FC based on these
methods may reflect individual network function, but
the resultant RSNs are likely composed of partly different
brain regions in different subjects and even more different
in diseased subjects because the commonness of ICA
components across subjects is not included in these new
ICA methods.
Increasing evidence suggests that neurodegenerative
diseases affect functional networks rather than specific
brain regions (Zhou et al. 2012), but the influence of the
diseases could impact distinct regions of the networks
differently (Damoiseaux et al. 2012, Li et al. 2013, Wang et
al. 2015). Therefore, disease‑related FC change of original
RSNs will result in new but impaired RSNs, showing
different spatial distribution, signal intensity, and internal
connection pattern (Littow et al. 2015, Hafkemeijer et al.
2012, Wang et al. 2013). Single‑subject ICA methods for the
analysis of FC will not include the regions decreasingly
correlated within original networks, but include new
regions increasingly correlated with original networks
at the individual level, probably due to compensatory
reaction (Damoiseaux et al. 2012, Vemuri et al. 2012, Seidler
et al. 2010). Therefore, FC from single‑subject ICA methods
might not be able to reflect the impaired regions within the
original networks and might be affected by new regions
outside the original networks. These two conditions will

4_771_Huang_v4.indd 295

offset each other, raising the possibility of poor reflection
of disease‑related FC change in the networks. Here, we
use RSNs derived from relatively normal subjects as the
template to calculate FC for both patients and controls.
This method may be able to more precisely reflect the
disease‑related FC change by including the impaired
regions in the original spatial distribution of normal RSNs
and excluding the outside compensatory reaction.
Our goal of this study was to provide a simple way to
enhance the power of ICA to reflect group differences of
RSNs. RSNs are relatively stable across healthy subjects
(Damoiseaux et al. 2006), and we think only neuronal
activities in the spatial maps of normal original RSNs are
more likely to reflect the disease‑related change. Therefore,
using the ICA maps from only healthy subjects to extract
FC of RSNs from both controls and patients might be
a reasonable and easy way to reflect FC changes of RSNs
in disease states. To test our hypothesis, we applied our
method to calculate the FC of the extensively studied the
default mode network (DMN) (Mevel et al. 2011) in three
diagnostic groups: Alzheimer’s disease (AD), mild cognitive
impairment (MCI), and healthy aging.

METHODS
Participants
Data used in the preparation of this article were obtained
from the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI)
database (adni.loni.usc.edu). The ADNI was launched in 2003
as a public‑private partnership, led by Principal Investigator
Michael W. Weiner, MD. The primary goal of ADNI has been to
test whether serial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron
emission tomography (PET), other biological markers, and
clinical and neuropsychological assessment can be combined
to measure the progression of MCI and early AD. Inclusion
criteria were subjects with baseline fMRI data and preprocessed
volumetric 3‑dimensional magnetization prepared rapid
acquisition gradient echo (3D‑MPRAGE) T1‑weighted images.
Left‑handed subjects were excluded. Based on the baseline
diagnosis, all subjects were separated into three groups: NL
(normal), MCI (mild cognitive impairment), and AD (dementia).
Baseline results of six neuropsychological examinations were
collected, including four examinations for general cognitive
evaluation: Mini‑Mental State Examination (MMSE), Montreal
Cognitive Assessment (MOCA), Clinical Dementia Rating Scale
Sum of Boxes (CDR‑SB), and modified Alzheimer’s Disease
Assessment Scale cognitive 13‑item scale (ADAS13), and two
scores specific for memory function: Memory domain in
Everyday Cognition scales (EcogMemory) and a composite
score for memory in ADNI dataset (ADNI_MEM). Besides,
baseline hippocampal volume (HipV) for each subject was also
recorded from the ADNI dataset.

MRI acquisition and analysis
We downloaded raw baseline fMRI data and preprocessed
3D‑MPRAGE T1‑weighted images from the public ADNI
website. The MRI scanners used for the included subjects
in this study were all Phillips 3T systems, and according to
the ADNI website, the preprocessing procedure in Phillips
systems was N3 correction.
All rfMRI data were preprocessed using FSL v5.0.8
(Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging of the Brain
Software Library; http://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/)
(Smith et al. 2004, Woolrich et al. 2009, Jenkinson et
al. 2012). The preprocessing steps applied to these
datasets included slice timing correction, motion
correction, removing non‑brain tissue, smoothing, and
high‑pass temporal filtering to remove low‑frequency
drifts. After preprocessing procedure, any participant
showing a maximum rotation more than 1.5 degree or
displacement more than 1.5 mm in any direction was
excluded. Then, the preprocessed time series data were
registered into a stereotactic space (MNI152 template;
Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI), Montreal QC)
(Greve and Fischl 2009, Jenkinson and Smith 2001) and
we resampled the MNI‑space time series data into 4‑mm
resolution for group ICA analysis to generate intrinsic
functional network templates with dimensionality at 20
(Beckmann et al. 2005). We used different subject groups
to conduct ICA analysis, including: 1) all subjects, 2) all
AD subjects, 3) all MCI subjects, and 4) all NL subjects.
For controlling subject number effect and because the AD
sample size (27 subjects) was the smallest, we collected

two groups with age and gender‑matched MCI and NL
subjects to form the 5) MCI_27 group and 6) NL_27 group.
Another 7) younger normal group (YN) was formed by
collecting 22 normal youngest subjects with equal gender
number (mean age: 69.1 years, ranging 65.1–73.9 years)
from the original NL group. Furthermore, we chose the
site with the largest subject number to form 8) a single
site population (SS) in order to diminish the effect
of heterogeneous data from multi‑site database with
23 subjects, including 10 AD subjects, 9 MCI subjects,
and 4 NL subjects. One downloaded ICA template was
from 9) BrainMap (BM) activation database, analyzed by
Smith and others (2009), which was from a 20‑component
analysis of 29671 subjects, derived from more than 7000
different functional maps. The other downloaded ICA
template was from Smith’s 20‑component analysis result
of FMRI data (Smith et al. 2009), composed of 36 healthy
young adults (mean age: 28.5 years, ranging 20–35 years;
21 men and 15 women), and this template was considered
as the 10) standard template (Smith) for comparison. In
addition, we downloaded 11) another group of young
and healthy control subjects from a single site of Autism
Brain Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE) project (http://
fcon_1000.projects.nitrc.org/indi/abide/) (Di Martino et
al. 2014) and the group comprised 28 subjects (mean age:
23.5 years, ranging 18–30 years, 22 men and 6 women).
This group had the most similar characteristics to Smith’s
template, but was analyzed by using our own identical
ICA procedure in order to exclude the effect of different
analytic method. Last, we performed 12) single‑subject
ICA for each subject (SICA) (Table I).

Using fslcc utility in FSL to compare with Smith’s
template, the DMN was then identified visually from the ICA
components with higher correlation for further FC analysis. FC
was calculated by measuring the internal correlation among
the four major portions of the DMN, including 1) the posterior
cingulate cortex and precuneus, 2) anterior cingulate cortex
and ventral medial prefrontal cortex, 3) right temporoparietal
junction, and 4) left temporoparietal junction (Utevsky et al.
2014, Mars et al. 2012). For the DMN in all 11 group ICA results,
we used a z value of 3.7 (representing p<0.0001) as a threshold
to divide the DMN into several clusters. After the visualization
check, 4 clusters fitting in the abovementioned 4 core regions
of the DMN were extracted for further FC calculation.
Individual FC in the DMN was then evaluated by calculating
the correlation among mean time courses of the resultant
4 core clusters in each of these 11 group ICA results. The same
method of extracting FC of the DMN was also applied on our
single‑subject ICA results to measure individual FC of the DMN.
Statistical analysis
Statistical analysis was performed using Statistical
Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) program, version 20

(SPSS Inc. Chicago, IL, USA). After test of homogeneity of
variance for age, gender, and years of schooling among
the three diagnostic groups, NL, MCI, and AD, the one‑way
analysis of variance (ANOVA) with post‑hoc test using
Scheffe’s method to observe group differences in FC of
the DMN from all 12 different ICA results. Cohen’s effect
size with 95% confidence interval for these between‑group
comparisons was also calculated. In addition, partial
correlation was used to observe the association between FC
of the DMN and 1) MMSE, 2) MOCA, 3) CDR‑SB, 4) ADAS13, 5)
EcogMemory, 6) ADNI_MEM, and 7) HipV, after controlling
for age, gender, and years of schooling. The threshold for
statistical significance was a p value of less than 0.05.

RESULTS
Subjects
The initial selection of subjects from the ADNI database,
searching for baseline visits with brain fMRI data and
preprocessed T1WI images, resulted in 173 subjects.
Among them, 28 subjects were excluded for the following
reasons: 11 left‑handed, 5 failing to transform fMRI data

to a 4D image, 2 with marked motion artifact, and 10
with imaging distortion. The resultant 145 subjects were
divided into three groups based on the baseline diagnosis:
NL group: 46 subjects (including 20 men) with mean age
74.04±5.67 years (ranging 65.1–85.6 years) and mean years
of schooling 16.78±2.11 years (ranging 12–20 years), MCI
group: 72 subjects (including 36 men) with mean age
71.33±7.61 years (ranging 55.5–88.6 years) and mean years
of schooling 15.94±2.67 years (ranging 11–20 years), and
AD group: 27 subjects (including 14 men) with mean age
72.68±7.44 years (ranging 55.9–86.5 years) and mean years
of schooling 15.63±2.69 years (ranging 12–20 years).
These three groups did not differ in terms of age, gender,
and years of schooling.
Group differences of FC in DMN
Among the three diagnostic groups, all 12 templates
did not show significant FC differences between NL and
MCI groups or between MCI and AD groups. However,
significantly higher FC in the NL group than the AD group
was found in 5 results: ABIDE (p=0.041), Normal (p=0.018),

Normal_27 (p=0.030), Smith (p=0.010), and YN (p=0.013).
The results of p values and Cohen’s d effect sizes for all the
between‑group comparisons were listed in Table II. All the
effect sizes in the comparison between NL and MCI and
between MCI and AD were below 0.50. The effect sizes in
the comparison between NL and AD ranged from 0.10 to
0.69 and the top five conditions with at least effect size of
0.60 were compatible with the significant results: ABIDE
(d=0.61), Normal (d=0.66), Normal_27 (d=0.60), Smith
(d=0.69), and YN (d=0.68).
Correlation between FC of DMN and
neuropsychological examinations or HipV
In MMSE, there was no significant correlation. In
MOCA, a positive correlation was found in ABIDE (r=0.204,
p=0.023), AD (r=0.182, p=0.043), All (r=0.206, p=0.022), MCI
(r=0.180, p=0.045), Normal (r=0.219, p=0.014), Normal_27
(r=0.211, p=0.018), Smith (r=0.223, p=0.013), and YN
(r=0.233, p=0.009). In CDR‑SB, a negative correlation
was noted in ABIDE (r=−0.196, p=0.029), Smith (r=−0.252,
p=0.005), and YN (r=−0.195, p=0.030). In ADAS13,

(r=0.301, p=0.001) and YN (r=0.252, p=0.005) (Table III).
MOCA and HipV showed relatively more significant
correlations with the twelve ICA results and the scatterplots
with fitted regression lines and associated R‑squared values
in significant correlations were created for these two
measurements respectively (Figs 1 and 2). The R‑squared
values ranged from 0.035 to 0.062 in MOCA and from 0.016
to 0.072 in HipV. Though not shown, the R‑squared values
in the significant correlations of the rest 5 measurements
were in similar ranges.

DISCUSSION
Among the twelve ICA results, significantly higher FC of
the DMN in NL than AD with relatively higher effect size was
demonstrated only in the ICA results from normal subjects,
including young and old normal subject groups, suggesting
using ICA templates from normal subjects was better to
demonstrate FC difference of the DMN between normal
subjects and patients with Alzheimer’s disease. In this
study, we used seven measurements to evaluate the twelve
ICA results. These seven measurements were known to be
able to reflect the effect of Alzheimer’s disease on patients,
including 4 general cognitive measurements, 2 specific

memory function measurements, and HipV. Among the
twelve ICA results, the stronger correlation results were
all from the ICA results from young healthy adults. On the
contrary, the weaker results were from heterogeneous
conditions, diseased groups, and single‑subject ICA
method. Therefore, using ICA templates from young
healthy subjects to extract FC of DMN was more likely to
enhance the correlation between FC change of DMN and
clinical measurements.
Among all ICA results, significantly higher FC in NL than
AD was demonstrated in the ABIDE, Normal, Normal_27,
Smith, and YN groups. There was no condition showing
significant difference between NL and MCI or between MCI
and AD. MCI condition is recognized as the transitional
zone between normal aging and AD, and although not
fulfilling the criteria for AD, MCI subjects have significant
cognitive deficits and are of higher risk for AD (Mueller et
al. 2005). In the research field of DMN in MCI, insignificant
difference of FC between normal and MCI subjects or
between MCI and AD subjects has been demonstrated but
FC of MCI group is numerically in between those of normal
and AD groups (Binnewijzend et al. 2012). The phenomenon
of ambiguous but intermediate status of FC in MCI and
increased FC in normal than AD groups is compatible with
our findings and is considered as a reasonable FC result.
This phenomenon might be due to the heterogeneous
regional FC changes in the DMN, including both increased
and decreased FC, in MCI status (Qi et al. 2010, Cha et al.
2013) and these bidirectional changes will increase the
variation of FC of the DMN as a whole. Besides, using
Cohen’s d effect size to evaluate these between‑group
comparisons, the comparisons between NL and MCI and
between MCI and AD show a d value below 0.50, suggesting
at most small effect in these comparisons (Cohen 1988).

Seven comparisons between NL and AD have medium
effect, including ABIDE, All, MCI_27, Normal, Normal_27,
Smith, and YN and of which, the top five comparisons
with an effect size of at least 0.60 are using ABIDE, Normal,
Normal_27, Smith, and YN ICA templates, compatible with
significant results. Among the three diagnostic groups,
better FC results came from only templates based on old
or young normal subjects. From this standpoint, FC of the
DMN by using ICA results from relatively normal healthy
groups are more likely to significantly show reasonable
findings, which might be obscured by using ICA results
from diseased or heterogeneous condition subjects or
single‑subject ICA method.
Furthermore, we chose 4 general cognitive
measurements,
2
specific
memory
function
measurements, and HipV to evaluate correlations
between these measurements, or HipV with FC of
the DMN in order to validate the ICA results in the
twelve conditions. MMSE is a commonly used reliable
test to measure cognitive impairment and a higher
score indicate a healthier condition (Pangman et al.
2000). However, in our study, no condition showed any
correlation with MMSE scores. Different regional FC
correlation of the DMN with MMSE has been noted and
is probably lower the significant correlation of average
FC in the whole DMN in our study (Cha et al. 2013).
MOCA is another validated tool for the detection of
cognitive impairment in MCI and early AD and a higher
score indicates a healthier condition (Nasreddine et
al. 2005). Significantly positive correlations existed
between MOCA scores and most DMN FC results,
including those from the ABIDE, AD, All, MCI, Normal,
Normal_27, Smith, and YN groups. No correlation was
found in results from the BM, MCI_27, and SS groups.
CDR‑SB score is useful to stage the severity of AD
and MCI, with a higher score indicating more severe
symptoms (O’Bryant et al. 2008). Negative correlation
between FC of the DMN and CDR‑SB scores was
present in the results from the ABIDE, Smith, and YN
groups. ADAS13 is used to evaluate cognitive function
including a variety of cognitive domains and a higher
score reflects more cognitive impairment (Mohs et al.
1997). Negative correlation between ADAS13 and FC
of the DMN was found in the result from Smith group.
Except for MMSE, better correlation results were
from the Smith template in the other three general
neuropsychiatric evaluations, closely followed by the
ABIDE and YN groups. The other results merely showed
one or no fitting correlation.
Moreover, memory impairment is one of the main
symptoms of AD, which also exists in MCI, and is the
earliest manifestation of AD (Association 2000, Salmon
2012). Results of two specific memory evaluations were
collected from ADNI website, including EcogMemory

4_771_Huang_v4.indd 300

Acta Neurobiol Exp 2016, 76: 294–303

and ADNI_MEM, which is a composite score for memory
function from the ADNI neuropsychological battery
using modern psychometric methods. EcogMemory is
one of the six domain‑specific factors included in the
measurement of Everyday Cognition (Ecog) and is a useful
tool to evaluate everyday memory function in the elderly.
A higher EcogMemory score is suggestive of worse daily
function (Farias et al. 2008). There were two conditions
showing negative correlations with the EcogMemory
score, including ABIDE and Smith. ADNI_MEM has been
tested for the power to predict progression from MCI to AD
and shows equal or better results as compared with many
other scores, such as longitudinal Rey Auditory Verbal
Learning Test, AD Assessment Schedule – Cognition,
MMSE, and CDR‑SB. In addition, ADNI_MEM is suggested
for analyzing the strength of associations between
imaging and memory and a higher score represents better
memory performance (Crane et al. 2012). In this study,
only the ABIDE, Smith and YN conditions showed positive
correlations with ADNI_MEM. For these two memory
specific measurements, only the ICA results from the
ABIDE group and Smith’s template show good correlation,
followed by the YN group. Furthermore, smaller HipV
in patients with AD and MCI as compared with healthy
controls has been validated in many studies (den Heijer
et al. 2010). Therefore, we also used HipV to evaluate
the quality of ICA results in the eleven conditions. There
were 6 conditions showing positive correlations between
FC of the DMN and HipV, including ABIDE, All, Normal,
Normal_27, Smith, and YN. Considering all six clinical
evaluation scores and HipV, the best two ICA results fitting
5 to 6 kinds of measurements were the Smith template and
the ABIDE group, followed by the YN group, which fitted
4 kinds of measurements. Three groups, All, Normal, and
Normal_27 groups, fitted 2 measurements. The AD and MCI
groups only fitted one measurement and the BM, MCI_27,
SS, and SICA results fitted no measurement. Thus, the best
results came from the Smith’s and ABIDE group templates,
both derived from young and healthy adults, while the
worst results come from the heterogeneous condition,
diseased groups, and single‑subject ICA method. The SS
group was purely from a single site but showed one of the
worst results, suggesting that single site data do not have
the strength to properly reflect clinical measurements and
the unsatisfactory result might be primarily due to the
heterogeneous condition of this single site population. The
correlation result from single‑subject ICA also showed one
of the worst results. This phenomenon might be partly due
to the different spatial distribution of the individual DMN,
which is likely affected by diseases, and to the change in
the spatial distribution results from the decreased and
increased regional FC of the whole brain to the original
healthy DMN, which might mutually offset. Therefore,
though the single‑subject ICA method is better to reflect

27/12/16 16:11

Acta Neurobiol Exp 2016, 76: 294–303

current individual FC of the DMN (Anderson et al. 2011,
Shi et al. 2015, Esposito et al. 2005), this method might
not be able to detect the influence of impaired regions of
DMN and to diminish the effect of compensatory regions
on the DMN (Damoiseaux et al. 2012, Vemuri et al. 2012,
Seidler et al. 2010). Instead, our method, using a DMN
template from young and normal subjects to extract FC of
the DMN for all subjects, is likely to solve this problem and
truly demonstrate a much better clinical correlation than
the single‑subject ICA method. In addition, the overall
correlation results from the Normal and Normal_27
groups were slightly worse than the results from the
ABIDE, Smith, and YN groups, among which, the YN group
was worse than the ABIDE group and Smith template. The
possible explanation is that although the subjects in the
NL group from the ADNI dataset have relatively preserved
cognitive function, they are aging and the aging process
can alter RSNs even though less severely than diseased
conditions (Huang et al. 2015, Onoda et al. 2012, Geerligs et
al. 2015, Agosta et al. 2012, Campbell et al. 2015). Therefore,
the DMN is still impaired in elder normal subjects, causing
relatively poor correlation results.
There are several limitations in this study. One
is that we performed ICA for subjects from the ADNI
dataset and ABIDE project subjects and downloaded the
templates from BM and Smith’s studies. Therefore, those
downloaded templates might be based on ICA using
different parameter settings from ours, even though
all are analyzed at the same dimensionality of 20. In
addition, fMRI data from the ADNI, ABIDE, BM, and FMRI
could be with different scan protocols, which might
affect the imaging quality and imaging results. The
solution to these limitations is to use the same group ICA
setting to analyze subjects from single MRI scanner with
identical scan protocols, with subjects who are young
healthy adults, normal elderly, and diseased participants.
All the resultant ICA templates from different groups
can be applied on identical subject groups with clinical
cognitive evaluations to test which result has better
power to reflect clinical conditions. Furthermore, the
R‑squared values in the linear regression analysis of
significant correlations between FC of DMN and the
seven measurements are quite low, suggesting marked
variability of the data, but this phenomenon is not
uncommon in studying human behavior.

CONCLUSION
By using group differences among three diagnostic
groups and using correlation evaluation with 4 global
cognitive measurements, 2 memory specific measurements,
and HipV, the best results fitting clinical evaluations were
the FC results of the DMN template derived from young

4_771_Huang_v4.indd 301

healthy subjects. Results from relatively young normal
elders intermediately fit the clinical evaluations and the
worst results were from heterogeneous or more severe
disease groups and single‑subject ICA method. The overall
findings suggest that the diseased condition or even aging
process will alter the DMN and some significant correlations
with clinical evaluations might be obscured by using the
DMN derived from ICA results with source subjects who are
diseased or aging, as compared with the ICA results from
young and healthy adults. The single‑subject ICA method is
able to reflect individual DMN condition but is of low power
to reflect disease influence on the DMN. Accordingly, testing
a new imaging analysis method, such as using different
ICA maps, on a well‑evaluated subject group might also be
helpful in order to reduce the possibility of false negative
or false positive results.
