A previous study indicated that adults with attention deﬁcit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) had a decreased
anti-correlation between the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) and the default mode network (DMN).
In this study, we investigated whether children with ADHD also show a decreased anti-correlation between
the dACC and the DMN. We also explored the developmental characteristics of the resting-state functional
connectivity (RSFC) of the dACC with the DMN in children with ADHD. Resting-state functional magnetic
resonance imaging scans were obtained from a 3T scanner in 19 drug-naïve boys with ADHD and 23 controls.
Compared with normal controls, the dACC in boys with ADHD showed a signiﬁcantly decreased negative RSFC
with the DMN, including the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex and the posterior cingulate cortex. The RSFC
strength between the dACC and the posterior cingulate cortex showed a signiﬁcantly negative correlation
with age in normal controls, but not in boys with ADHD. This decreased anti-correlation may suggest an
abnormal balance or interaction between attentional and intrinsic thoughts. Our age-related analysis
suggested an abnormal development pattern of the dACC-DMN interaction in ADHD.

1. Introduction
Attention deﬁcit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most
common neurodevelopmental disorders in childhood, with a prevalence of approximately 5% among school-age children (for review, see
Bush et al., 2005). The disorder is characterized by developmentally
inappropriate symptoms of inattention, impulsivity and hyperactivity.
Although the etiology of ADHD has remained unknown, convergent
evidence has implicated fronto-striatal network impairment (for
review, see Bush et al., 2005).
The dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) is an important
component of the fronto-striatal circuitry. Many studies have indicated
that the dACC plays an important role in the pathology of ADHD.
Dysfunction of the dACC could lead to all the cardinal signs of ADHD (see
Bush et al., 2005). Structural neuroimaging studies found that both
ADHD children and adults had signiﬁcantly smaller ACC volumes than
controls (Carmona et al., 2005; Makris et al., 2007). Functional magnetic

resonance imaging (fMRI) studies consistently reported decreased
activation in the dACC in subjects with ADHD compared with normal
controls in several cognitive tasks, including a Stroop-like paradigm
(Bush et al., 1999), Go/No-Go tasks (Tamm et al., 2004) and decisionmaking tasks (Ernst et al., 2003). Recently, resting-state fMRI studies
showed abnormal spontaneous activity in the ACC in children with
ADHD (Cao et al., 2006; Castellanos et al., 2008).
The dACC has widespread connections with many other brain regions
including the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), the parietal cortex
and the striatum (for review, see Bush et al., 2005). Both cognition and
behavior are based on the integrated activity of multiple brain regions,
rather than activity in any one isolated region; hence, studying the
coupling between regions would seem useful for understanding brain
function (Friston, 1994). The relationship between regions can be
measured by functional connectivity, which describes the spatiotemporal
correlations between spatially distinct brain regions (Friston, 1994). Using
this method, Biswal et al. (1995) found that spontaneous low-frequency
ﬂuctuations (0.01–0.08 Hz) in resting-state blood oxygenation leveldependent signals within the somatomotor system were highly synchronous and concluded that these were physiologically meaningful. Recently,
resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) MRI has been widely used to
characterize the pathophysiological changes of some neurological
diseases, disorders such as ADHD (Castellanos et al., 2008; Cao et al.,
2009), autism (Di Martino et al., 2009) and Tourette syndrome (Church
et al., 2009).

The default mode network (DMN), ﬁrst identiﬁed by Raichle et al.,
comprises the medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC), the posterior cingulate
cortex (PCC) and the precuneus in the midline of the brain and the
bilateral inferior parietal lobule (Raichle et al., 2001). During the resting
state, the DMN was found to be negatively correlated with the
attentional network (Fox et al., 2005). Many structural and functional
neuroimaging studies have demonstrated that components of the DMN
are abnormal in ADHD children and ADHD adults (Carmona et al., 2005;
Rubia et al., 2005; Makris et al., 2007). Weissman et al. (2006) found that
attentional lapses were associated with a decreased negative correlation
between the dACC and the DMN in healthy adult volunteers. A recent
review by Sonuga-Barke and Castellanos (2007) described the consequent temporally distinctive effects on cognition and behavior of DMN
interference into active processing periods. They speculated that the
DMN interference was a contributor to ADHD. This hypothesis was
tested by their later study, which found that the posterior components
(i.e., the precuneus and PCC of the DMN) were less anti-correlated with
the dACC in adult ADHD than in controls (Castellanos et al., 2008). We
hypothesized that such decreased negative correlation between the
dACC and the DMN would also exist in children with ADHD.
Recently, several studies have reported that both the cingulate and
the DMN showed distinct age-dependent development of RSFC in
healthy volunteers (Fair et al., 2007). Kelly and colleagues reported that
healthy adults have a negative relationship between the dACC and the
DMN, and that these negatively connected networks are weaker in
children and adolescents. They suggested that the signiﬁcantly agerelated shift in the patterns of RSFC associated with the ACC may
represent an index of brain maturation (Kelly et al., 2009). Furthermore,
Fair et al. (2010) found reduced connectivity within the DMN in ADHD
patients compared with age-matched controls. They considered that the
atypical connectivity in ADHD may relate to delayed or disrupted
maturation. Therefore, our second aim was to perform a preliminary
exploration of the developmental characteristics of the brain areas, if
any, showing abnormal functional connectivity with the dACC in
children with ADHD. Given that the medication history might confound
the ﬁndings of ADHD-speciﬁc neuropathology (Rubia et al., 2005), the
current study included drug-naïve patients only.
2. Methods
2.1. Subjects
Twenty-three drug-naïve boys with ADHD and 25 age-matched
healthy boys were included in this study. All the data were from our
previous study (Cao et al., 2006) However, in the current study, only
drug-naïve boys with ADHD were included in the ADHD group to reduce
drug effects. We used the same data as in our previous study (Cao et al.,
2009), which explored the resting-state functional connectivity patterns
of the putamen in children with and without ADHD. Data from four
patients and two normal subjects were excluded because of excessive
head motion (see Section 2.3. Data preprocessing). The ages of the
remaining subjects were matched for the two groups (ADHD: n = 19,
age: 13.28 (S.D. = 1.35) years; controls: n = 23, age: 13.20 (S.D. = 0.95)
years; t (40)= −0.22, P = 0.827).
All participants were between 11 and 16 years. All the subjects met
the following criteria: 1) right-handedness; 2) no lifetime history of
head trauma with loss of consciousness; 3) no history of neurological
illness or other severe disease; 4) no history of psychiatric disorders
including schizophrenia, affective disorder and pervasive developmental disorder; 5) scores of higher than 80 on the Wechsler Intelligence
Scale for Chinese Children — Revised (Gong and Cai, 1993).
ADHD children were recruited from the juvenile psychiatric clinic at
the Institute of Mental Health, Peking University. Inclusion in the ADHD
group was based on separate clinical assessments by two pediatric
psychiatrists, one of whom was a senior psychiatrist. Diagnostic criteria
were derived from the Clinical Diagnostic Interviewing Scales (CDIS)

(Barkley, 1998), a structured and interviewer-administered scale based
on DSM-IV (American Psychiatric Association, 1994). The CDIS is
composed of questions about behavioral and emotional disorders of
childhood, such as ADHD, oppositional deﬁant disorder (ODD), conduct
disorder (CD), tic disorder, emotional disorder, affective disorder,
anxiety, and obsessive-compulsive disorder. The ADHD Rating Scale —
IV (ADHD RS-IV) was obtained from parents to assess the presence and
severity of ADHD symptoms. The ADHD RS-IV contains all the
inattention and hyperactivity/impulsivity symptoms of ADHD according
to DSM-IV. Each symptom is scored according to how often it occurs (i.e.,
“never” is rated as 1, “occasionally” is 2; “often” is 3; and “always” is 4).
ADHD patients with comorbid CD or ODD were not excluded.
Twelve patients met criteria for the ADHD-I subtype (the predominantly inattentive subtype; two of these had comorbid ODD, one had
comorbid CD) and seven for the ADHD-C subtype (the combined
subtype; three of these had comorbid ODD, one had comorbid CD).
The controls came from local schools near the Institute of Mental
Health, Peking University. They were also screened by the same
psychiatrists using the CDIS.
This study was approved by the Research Ethics Review Board of the
Institute of Mental Health, Peking University. After a complete description
of the study procedures, written informed consent was obtained from
parents or guardians of the subjects. All children agreed to participate.
2.2. Imaging procedures
MRI data were acquired using a 3T SIEMENS Trio scanner (Siemens
Medical Solutions, Erlangen, Germany) in the Institute of Biophysics,
Chinese Academy of Sciences. In addition to resting-state fMRI and 3D
structural MRI, there were task-state fMRI and diffusion tensor
imaging scanning sessions (Cao et al., 2008, 2010). The parameters
for the resting-state fMRI were as follows: 30 axial slices, echo-planar
imaging pulse sequence, thickness/gap = 4.5/0 mm, in-plane resolution = 64 × 64, TR = 2000 ms, TE = 30 ms, ﬂip angle = 90°,
FOV = 220 × 220 mm, 240 volumes. The subjects were asked to keep
still as far as possible, keep their eyes closed, and try not to think of
anything in particular during the resting-state fMRI scanning.
Our data were collected over a period of approximately 2 years and
some modiﬁcations were made to the parameters for the 3D structural
images. Among the 42 subjects (19 ADHD and 23 controls) included in
the statistical analysis, four sets of parameters for the 3D T1-weighted
structural images were used, as shown in Table 1. However, only two of
the parameter sets were used for 40 of the 42 subjects. In addition, the
proportion of the number of subjects using the two sets of parameters
was similar for ADHD patients and normal controls. The 3D images were
used for spatial normalization (see Section 2.3. Data preprocessing).
2.3. Data preprocessing
The ﬁrst 10 volumes were discarded for scanner calibration and for
subjects' adaptation to the scanner noise. Part of the data preprocessing
was performed using SPM5 (http://www.ﬁl.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm), including
slice timing and head motion correction (a least squares approach and a

six-parameter spatial transformation). Data from four patients and two
normal subjects were excluded because of excessive head motion (more
than 3 mm of translation or more than 3° of rotation in any direction). The
fMRI data were spatially normalized to the Montreal Neurological
Institute (MNI) template (resampled voxel size=3×3×3 mm3) via the
gray matter obtained from 3D images as follows. The individual 3D
structural image was co-registered to the fMRI data and then segmented
into gray matter, white matter and cerebrospinal ﬂuid. Then the
individual gray matter image was spatially normalized to the MNI gray
matter template and the transformation matrix was also used on the fMRI
data. This segmentation procedure was used to improve the accuracy of
spatial normalization (Ashburner and Friston, 2005). The fMRI data were
spatially smoothed (full width at half maximum=4 mm). An in-house
software Resting-State fMRI Data Analysis Toolkit (REST; http://www.
restmri.net) was then used for removing the linear trend of the time series
and temporal band-pass ﬁltering (0.01–0.08 Hz) (Biswal et al., 1995).
2.4. Functional connectivity analysis
The seed region of interest (ROI) in the current study approximates
the location of the bilateral dACC deﬁned in a previous review (Bush
et al., 2000) and in a previous study (Tian et al., 2006). The detailed
deﬁnition procedures were as follows. The bilateral dACC was extracted
from the automated anatomical labeling template (Tzourio-Mazoyer
et al., 2002) from MRIcro software (http://www.cabiatl.com/mricro/)
(Fig. 1). The anterior border of the dACC-ROI was deﬁned as the coronal
plane crossing the most anterior edge of the corpus callosum. The
posterior border of the dACC-ROI was deﬁned as the coronal plane
crossing the anterior commissure (Bush et al., 2000) (Fig. 1). This ROI
was re-sampled to voxel size= 3 × 3 × 3 mm3. Subsequent data processing was performed using REST software. The time courses within this
ROI were averaged to generate a reference time course for each subject.
Pearson's correlation analysis was performed between the seed
reference time course and the time series of each voxel in the brain in
a voxel-wise manner, with the global mean time course, the white
matter mean time course, the cerebrospinal ﬂuid mean time course and
the six head motion parameters as nuisance covariates. Individual
correlation coefﬁcients were converted to z-scores using Fisher's
transformation to improve the normality.
2.5. Statistical analysis
2.5.1. Within-group connectivity of the dACC
One-sample t-tests were performed on the z-maps of boys with
ADHD and controls, respectively. Voxels with P b 0.05 and cluster
size N 1485 mm 3 were taken as being signiﬁcantly connected to the
dACC. Such a combination corresponds to P b 0.05 after correction for

3

multiple comparisons using Monte Carlo simulation (AlphaSim in
AFNI software; http://afni.nimh.nih.gov).
2.5.2. Between-group differences in connectivity of the dACC
Voxels surviving the combination criteria in either the ADHD
group or the control group formed a union mask, in which the
surviving voxels have signiﬁcant functional connectivity to the dACC
in at least one group. A recent resting-state fMRI study showed that IQ
correlated with spontaneous activity (Song et al., 2008). Therefore, to
reduce the potential confounding effect of IQ, we used IQ as a covariate
when performing the two-sample t-test. The two-sample t-test was
implemented using the 3dRegAna program in AFNI software. Voxels
with P b 0.01 and cluster size N324 mm3 (12 voxels) were taken as being
signiﬁcantly different between the two groups in functional connectivity
to the dACC. Such a combination corresponds to P b 0.05 after correction
for multiple comparisons using Monte Carlo simulation (using
AlphaSim).
All the results were overlaid on a structural image in MRIcro software
and converted to Talairach and Tournoux coordinates (Talairach and
Tournoux, 1988).
2.5.3. Exploratory correlation between the connectivity of the dACC
and age
To investigate the development of functional connectivity of the
dACC, exploratory correlation analyses were performed between the
mean z-scores of each cluster and the age of each group.
3. Results
3.1. Demographic information and standardized tests
As shown in Table 2, there was no signiﬁcant difference between
the two groups in terms of age (t (40) = −0.220, P = 0.827). The
mean IQ of the controls was higher than that of the ADHD subjects
(t (40) = −2.976, P = 0.005). Compared with the controls, the ADHD
group obtained higher scores in the ADHD RS-IV (t (40) = − 8.094,
P = 1.270 × 10 − 9).
3.2. Within-group connectivity patterns of the dACC
One-sample t-tests within the control group showed that the dACC
had a positively correlated network as well as a negatively correlated
network (Fig. 2A). The functional connectivity patterns were very
similar in the right and left hemispheres. The positive network consisted
of the DLPFC, the basal ganglia, the insula, the superior and middle
temporal gyri, the supplementary motor area, the middle cingulate
cortex and the anterior part of the cerebellum. The negative network
included the PCC, the precuneus, the MPFC, the bilateral inferior parietal
lobule, the hippocampi, and the bilateral hemispheres. Most of the
negatively correlated regions are within the DMN. In spite of the
signiﬁcant between-group difference (see Section 3.3 below), by visual

inspection, the pattern of functional connectivity of the dACC for the
ADHD group (Fig. 2B) was similar to that of the control group.
3.3. Between-group connectivity differences
Compared with the normal controls, the dACC in boys with ADHD
showed decreased negative functional connectivity with the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (DMPFC) (Brodmann areas (BA) 9 and 10)
(P b 0.05, corrected) and the PCC (BA 29, 30) (P b 0.05, corrected); the
latter extending to the adjacent retrosplenial cortex (BA 29, 30) and
lingual gyri (BA 18) (P b 0.05, corrected) (Table 3, Fig. 3). In detail, all of
these brain areas showed signiﬁcant negative connectivity with the
dACC in normal controls (Table 3), while the functional connectivity
with the dACC was not signiﬁcant (P N 0.05), i.e., no functional

connectivity exists, in ADHD subjects. The left middle temporal gyrus
(MTG) also showed a signiﬁcant between-group difference in functional
connectivity with the dACC (P b 0.05, corrected). In detail, the left MTG
showed no signiﬁcant functional connectivity with the dACC in normal
controls, while it showed signiﬁcant negative functional connectivity in
ADHD subjects (Table 3, Fig. 3).
Furthermore, in order to clarify whether age had a signiﬁcant effect
on the group differences in functional connectivity with the dACC, we
also used age as a covariate when performing the statistical analysis on
the clusters showing signiﬁcant differences. Compared with the normal
controls, the dACC in boys with ADHD still showed decreased negative
functional connectivity with the DMPFC (F(1, 39) = 13.606, P = 0.001)
and the PCC (F(1, 39) = 16.361, P = 0.0002); the latter extending to the
adjacent retrosplenial cortex and lingual gyri (F(1, 39) = 13.207,

age and strength of functional connectivity of the dACC to the PCC
showed a signiﬁcant negative correlation (r = − 0.463, P = 0.026) in
normal controls, but not in boys with ADHD (r = − 0.183, P = 0.454)
(Fig. 4). No other signiﬁcant correlation between age and connectivity
strength was found.
4. Discussion

Fig. 3. Results of two-sample t-tests on the functional connectivity of the dACC. (A)
Yellow color (including the PCC and the DMPFC) indicates increased functional
connectivity with the dACC in the ADHD group and vice versa for the blue color (the left
MTG). (B) In the left RSG/LG, the left DMPFC and right PCC, normal controls showed
signiﬁcantly negative functional connectivity (P b 0.05), but ADHD subjects showed no
signiﬁcant connectivity (P N 0.05). In the right MTG, children with ADHD showed
signiﬁcantly negative functional connectivity, but normal controls showed no
signiﬁcant connectivity. See Table 3 for more details. ADHD: attention deﬁcit
hyperactivity disorder; RSG: retrosplenial gyrus; LG, lingual gyrus; DMPFC, dorsomedial prefrontal cortex; PCC, posterior cingulate cortex; MTG, middle temporal gyrus.

P = 0.001). The left MTG also showed a signiﬁcant between-group
difference in functional connectivity with the dACC (F(1, 39) = 7.900,
P = 0.008). Therefore, in our study, age had no signiﬁcant effect on the
results.
3.4. Correlation analysis of connectivity of the dACC with age
Correlation analysis was performed between the connectivity
strength (i.e., the mean z-value of each cluster) of the brain regions
showing group differences and the age for each group separately. The

In the current study, we analyzed the intrinsic functional
connectivity patterns of the dACC in drug-naïve boys with ADHD
and healthy controls, and explored the correlation between the age
and connectivity strength of the dACC. Our ﬁndings were consistent
with, and expanded upon, observations from a previous study of
adults with ADHD (Castellanos et al., 2008). On the whole, the
functional connectivity patterns in ADHD subjects were similar to
those of controls. In the control group, the positive network consisted
of the DLPFC, the basal ganglia, the insula, the superior and middle
temporal gyri, the supplementary motor area, the middle cingulate
cortex, and the anterior part of the cerebellum. The negative network
included the PCC, the precuneus, the MPFC, the inferior parietal
lobule, and the bilateral cerebellar hemisphere. Most of the anticorrelated regions were within the DMN. These results are consistent
with the results of previous anatomical and functional neuroimaging
studies (Vogt et al., 1995; Margulies et al., 2007).
In the between-group analysis, the PCC (including its adjacent
retrosplenial cortex and lingual gyrus) and DMPFC showed signiﬁcantly
decreased negative connectivity with the dACC in ADHD subjects. In
normal controls only, the age and connectivity strength of the dACC
were signiﬁcantly negatively correlated, i.e., as the children grow older,
the anti-correlation between the dACC and the PCC becomes stronger.
We found that the PCC showed disrupted connectivity to the dACC in
ADHD subjects. The PCC, an important component of the DMN, is
associated with an introspective attentional orientation related to
mentalizing and emotional processing during rest (Buckner et al., 2008).
Recently, the PCC has been receiving increasing attention in the ADHD
neuroimaging literature. Studies of children and adolescents with ADHD
using whole-brain voxel-based morphometry have identiﬁed gray
matter volume reduction in the PCC (Carmona et al., 2005; Makris et al.,
2007). Several task-based fMRI studies found that adolescents with
ADHD showed abnormal activation in the PCC, which was negatively
correlated with ADHD symptom severity (Rubia et al., 2005; Silk et al.,
2005). In addition, during high-order motor control tasks, both the ACC
and PCC showed decreased activation in adolescents of the ADHD group

(Rubia et al., 1999). Fransson (2006) found that a suppression and a
reorganization of intrinsic network activity occur in response to an
attention-demanding task, and conﬁrmed that spontaneous intrinsic
activity in the DMN is attenuated during performance of a working
memory task. Weissman et al. (2006) reported that momentary lapses
in attention are associated with both reduced activity in the frontal
control regions (the dACC) and greater activity (that is, failure to
suppress activity) in the DMN (including the PCC and precuneus),
suggesting an imbalance in the fronto-DMN in this condition. Therefore,
Sonuga-Barke and Castellanos (2007) hypothesized that fronto-DMN
interactions may represent a novel locus of dysfunction in ADHD, which
could potentially account for the ADHD-related increases in intrasubject
variability. Subsequently, Castellanos et al. (2008) conﬁrmed that ADHD
in adults is also associated with abnormalities in the dACC-PCC
connectivity. They interpreted their ﬁndings that the long-range
connection linking the dACC to the PCC should be considered a candidate
locus of dysfunction in ADHD (Castellanos et al., 2008). Our ﬁndings
were consistent with these. In addition, using the same data, our
previous study found decreased negative functional connectivity
between the putamen and the regions in the DMN in children with
ADHD. It also suggested that the impairment of the balance between the
DMN and other regions in the brain may underlie the pathological basis
of ADHD (Cao et al., 2009). Given that many studies have indicated that
adults and children with ADHD share similar clinical features,
neuropsychological deﬁcits and failures in major life domains (Faraone
et al., 2000), combination of the results of the current study of children
with those of the earlier study of adults (Castellanos et al., 2008) suggests
that a disconnection between the dACC and the PCC may exist in children
with ADHD and persist into adulthood.
Similar to the PCC, the DMPFC is also a “core hub” in the DMN,
which is associated with introspective orientated thought (Buckner
et al., 2008). There is evidence indicating functional or structural
abnormalities of the DMPFC in ADHD subjects. Rubia et al. (2010)
reported that ADHD boys showed reduced activation compared with
healthy control children in the right DMPFC. Fassbender et al. found
that children with ADHD displayed signiﬁcantly more reaction time
variability and less deactivation in the MPFC than controls during a
working memory paradigm (Fassbender et al., 2009). Moreover, the
increased variability in reaction time was also related to abnormal
activation in the ACC in adolescents with ADHD (Rubia et al., 2007).
Our research indicated the abnormal relationship between the ACC
and the DMPFC. Hence, decreased functional connectivity between
the dACC and the MPFC may play a role in the pathophysiological
mechanisms of ADHD in children.
However, Castellanos et al. (2008) did not ﬁnd decreased functional
connectivity between the dACC and the DMPFC. Shaw et al. (2007)
reported that the ADHD group (10.2 ± 3.2 years) displayed development of the MPFC that was later than in normal children, lagging behind
5 years in terms of it reaching its cortical peak thickness. This suggests
that the age difference may, at least in part, explain the differences
between Castellanos et al.'s conclusions and our own. A study by Kelly
et al. (2009) used a unidirectional assumption of decrease or increase
between three groups, i.e., children N adolescents N adults, or children adolescents b adults. They found that the anti-correlation between the
dACC and the dMPFC in the DMN increased with age. This suggests that
the abnormal functional connectivity of the dACC with the MPFC in
children with ADHD may be normalized in adulthood. However, the
age-related changes in functional connectivity between the dACC and
the MPFC in Kelly et al.'s study were obtained by group comparison.
Group comparison does provide a difference between groups but does
not provide within-group information. In other words, it is unclear
whether there is a linear correlation between the functional connectivity strength of the dACC-DMPFC and age in children. The current study
did not ﬁnd a signiﬁcant linear correlation in either the ADHD or the
control group. However, our sample size may be too small to depict a
developmental trajectory.

In the current study, the left MTG showed a signiﬁcant difference in
connectivity with the dACC between the children with ADHD and the
healthy boys. There is evidence for structural (Kobel et al., 2010) and
functional (Shafritz et al., 2004; Tamm et al., 2004) abnormalities in the
temporal lobe in ADHD. Kobel et al. (2010) found that boys with ADHD
showed smaller gray matter volumes and decreased magnetization
transfer imaging values in the temporal lobe. They speculated that the
temporal lobe might play a key role in the etiology of ADHD. During the
divided attention task, adolescents with ADHD showed signiﬁcantly less
activation in the middle temporal gyrus than the comparison subjects,
and only the left middle temporal lobe activation was correlated with
accuracy on the visual selective tasks (Shafritz et al., 2004). Furthermore, Tamm and colleagues found that, compared with the control
subjects, adolescents with ADHD showed increased activation in the left
MTG while decreased activation was found in the dACC (Tamm et al.,
2004). The authors proposed an involvement of the frontotemporal
circuitry in aberrant response inhibition and task switching in ADHD
(Tamm et al., 2004). To some extent, the inverse activation patterns in
the left MTG and dACC in that study seem to be consistent with the
current result of abnormal negative connectivity between the two brain
areas. So far, interpretation of the abnormal connectivity between the
dACC and the MTG remains uncertain. Further investigation of the
interaction between the left MTG and the dACC in ADHD is needed, and
this ﬁnding requires replication.
In the present study, we found that the strength of the anticorrelation between the dACC and the PCC increased with age in the
normal children. However, in the ADHD group, the anti-correlation
was weakened and there was no linear relationship with age. This
showed that the children with ADHD have abnormal development
patterns for the dACC–DMN interaction. It is unclear whether ADHD
results from a delay in brain maturation or whether it represents a
complete deviation from the template of typical development. Several
functional imaging studies have found that ADHD indicates a
developmental deviation rather than a maturational lag in the central
nervous system (Clarke et al., 2001; Hobbs et al., 2007). Our ﬁndings
are in line with the results mentioned above. However, using
structural imaging studies, Shaw et al. (2007) and Castellanos et al.
(2002) found that the development of the cortical thickness and
regional cerebral volumes in children with ADHD lagged behind those
of typically developing children by several years, but that the
maturational process proceeded normally (with the potential for
later “catch up”). We believe that a simple “delay-only” or “deviationonly” paradigm will likely be insufﬁcient to describe ADHD populations fully. It is possible that the developmental trajectories of the
brain function and structure are not parallel in ADHD, although the
delayed structural maturation of the brain in ADHD subjects becomes
normalized with age. However, the integrated pattern or the
interaction of multiple brain regions in ADHD subjects may remain
different from those in normal controls. This might explain why up to
80% of ADHD children continue to experience symptoms in later life.
From a functional connectivity point of view, our ﬁndings imply that
abnormal development of the dACC–DMN interaction is involved in
the pathogenesis of ADHD. This study is the ﬁrst to explore the
developmental characteristics of RSFC of the dACC with the DMN in
children and adolescents with ADHD. Further studies are needed to
establish the validity of our results.
Several issues in the present study should be noted. Firstly, we
regressed out the global mean signal when performing functional
connectivity analysis, as is done in most functional connectivity studies
(e.g., Fox et al., 2005; Castellanos et al., 2008; Kelly et al., 2009). However,
the global trend was not taken as a nuisance covariate in a previous ADHD
study (Tian et al., 2006), in which an increased positive functional
connectivity between the dACC and the PCC was found in ADHD children,
and the antiphase relationships were not different. No other brain regions
in the DMN displayed abnormal connectivity with the dACC in that study
(Tian et al., 2006). A recent study suggested that removal of the global

L. Sun et al. / Psychiatry Research: Neuroimaging xxx (2012) xxx–xxx

mean signal is the most likely cause of anti-correlation (Murphy et al.,
2009). Therefore, it is likely that removal of the global mean signal may
account for the discrepancy between our results and those of Tian et al.
and Castellanos et al. (2008). Examining the effect of removing or not
removing the global trend will provide more information from a
methodological point of view. However, in addition, the subject
population of the current study was very different from that used in
Tian et al. (2006). Some discrepancies between the results would be
expected even without removing the global trend. We support that an
abnormal anti-correlation between the external attentional system and
the internal intrinsic thought system is a plausible interpretation of
ADHD from a pathopsychological point of view (Sonuga-Barke and
Castellanos, 2007). However, further studies on the effect of the global
mean signal are needed. Secondly, the current study included two
subtypes of ADHD (12 subjects with ADHD-I and 7 with ADHD-C). The
two subtypes were not analyzed separately because of the relatively
small sample size. Future studies with well-deﬁned patient populations
will better elucidate the characteristics of the ADHD subtypes.
In recent years, our group has collected a cohort of RS-fMRI dataset
including about 32 boys with ADHD and 28 control boys. Using various
analytic approaches commonly used in the community of RS-fMRI, our
collaborative groups have had a few publications on this dataset (or
subset). This dataset is freely available now (http://fcon_1000.projects.
nitrc.org/indi/adhd200/). These analytic approaches included linear
correlation based functional connectivity (Tian et al., 2006; Cao et al.,
2009), regional homogeneity (Cao et al., 2006), amplitude of low
frequency ﬂuctuation (Zang et al., 2007), small world complex network
analysis (Wang et al., 2009), and Fisher discriminative analysis (Zhu
et al., 2008). In addition, a structural study has also been implemented
on this dataset to measure the area and white matter integrity of the
corpus callosum (Cao et al., 2010). However, few studies have
investigated the relationship of these methods. Even for the linear
correlation-based functional connectivity analysis, different seed ROIs
will yield very different connectivity patterns (Tian et al., 2006; Cao
et al., 2009). It should be critical for future methodological studies to
reveal the relationships among these methods. This will help to
understand the ADHD pathophysiology from various aspects (please
see Supplementary electronic material).
In summary, our current resting-state fMRI study found a
decreased anti-correlation between the dACC and the DMN in boys
with ADHD compared with control boys. The present ﬁnding is in line
with the hypothesis that ADHD is associated with abnormalities in
fronto-default mode interactions (Sonuga-Barke and Castellanos,
2007). This decreased anti-correlation may suggest an abnormal
balance or interaction between attentional and intrinsic thoughts. Our
age-related analysis suggests a deviation in normal development of
the dACC–DMN interaction in ADHD.
