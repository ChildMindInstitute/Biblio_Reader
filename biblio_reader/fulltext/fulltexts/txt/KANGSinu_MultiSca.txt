ABSTRACT
Graph wavelets are proven useful and efficient to deal with graph-like structured data [1,2].
We consider resting state functional MRI data of 216 Attention Deficit Hyperacticity Disorder
(ADHD) patients and normal controls obtained from New York University [3]. From the data,
a graph, or a network, is generated where its nodes represent individuals and edges are given
by a proper similarity measure. We construct the scaling functions and wavelets on the graph
and show that these functions at different scales retrieve meaningful information of the data at
different levels.
